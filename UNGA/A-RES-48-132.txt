		48/132.Strengthening of the rule of law


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling that the achievement of international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language and religion is one of the purposes of the United Nations,

	Firmly convinced that, as stressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the rule of law is an essential factor in the protection of human rights, 

	Convinced that through their own national legal and judicial systems States must provide appropriate civil, criminal and administrative remedies for violations of human rights,

	Aware of the need for the implementation of strengthened advisory services and technical assistance activities in the field of human rights,

	1.	Endorses the recommendation of the World Conference on Human Rights that a comprehensive programme be established within the United Nations and under the coordination of the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat, with a view to helping States in the task of building and strengthening adequate national structures which have a direct impact on the overall observance of human rights and the maintenance of the rule of law; 5/

	2.	Expresses its conviction that such a programme should be able to provide, upon the request of the interested Government, technical and financial assistance for the implementation of national plans of action as well as specific projects for the reform of penal and correctional establishments and the education and training of lawyers, judges and security forces in human rights, and in any other sphere of activity relevant to the good functioning of the rule of law;

Requests the Secretary-General, in accordance with the request contained in section II, paragraph 70, of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 4/ to submit concrete proposals to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session containing alternatives for the establishment, structure, operational modalities and funding of the proposed programme, taking into account existing programmes and activities already undertaken by the Centre for Human Rights;

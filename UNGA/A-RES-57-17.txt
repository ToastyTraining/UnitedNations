Resolution adopted by the General Assembly
[on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/57/562 and Corr.1)]
		57/17.	Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its thirty-fifth session


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966, by which it established the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law with a mandate to further the progressive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade and in that respect to bear in mind the interests of all peoples, in particular those of developing countries, in the extensive development of international trade,
	Reaffirming its belief that the progressive harmonization and unification of international trade law, in reducing or removing legal obstacles to the flow of international trade, especially those affecting the developing countries, would contribute significantly to universal economic cooperation among all States on a basis of equality, equity and common interest and to the elimination of discrimination in international trade and, thereby, to the well-being of all peoples,
	Having considered the report of the Commission on its thirty-fifth session,1
	Concerned that activities undertaken by other bodies of the United Nations system in the field of international trade law without adequate coordination with the Commission might lead to undesirable duplication of efforts and would not be in keeping with the aim of promoting efficiency, consistency and coherence in the unification and harmonization of international trade law, as stated in its resolution 37/106 of 16 December 1982,
	Reaffirming the mandate of the Commission, as the core legal body within the United Nations system in the field of international trade law, to coordinate legal activities in this field,
	1.	Takes note with appreciation of the report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on its thirty-fifth session;1
	2.	Takes note with satisfaction of the completion and adoption by the Commission of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Model Law on International Commercial Conciliation;2
	3.	Commends the Commission for the progress made in its work on arbitration, insolvency law, electronic commerce, privately financed infrastructure projects, security interests and transport law;
	4.	Reaffirms the importance, in particular for developing countries, of the work of the Commission concerned with training and technical assistance in the field of international trade law, and in this connection: 
	(a)	Expresses its appreciation to the Commission for organizing seminars and briefing missions in Brazil, Cambodia, Ecuador, Indonesia and Viet Nam;
	(b)	Expresses its appreciation to the Governments whose contributions enabled the seminars and briefing missions to take place, and appeals to Governments, the relevant bodies of the United Nations system, organizations, institutions and individuals to make voluntary contributions to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Trust Fund for Symposia and, where appropriate, to the financing of special projects, and otherwise to assist the secretariat of the Commission in financing and organizing seminars and symposia, in particular in developing countries, and in the award of fellowships to candidates from developing countries to enable them to participate in such seminars and symposia;
	(c)	Reiterates its appeal to the United Nations Development Programme and other bodies responsible for development assistance, such as the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and regional development banks, as well as to Governments in their bilateral aid programmes, to support the training and technical assistance programme of the Commission and to cooperate and coordinate their activities with those of the Commission;
	5.	Stresses the importance of bringing into effect the conventions emanating from the work of the Commission for the global unification and harmonization of international trade law, and to this end urges States that have not yet done so to consider signing, ratifying or acceding to those conventions;
	6.	Appeals to Governments, the relevant bodies of the United Nations system, organizations, institutions and individuals to make voluntary contributions to the trust fund established to provide travel assistance to developing countries that are members of the Commission, at their request and in consultation with the Secretary-General;
	7.	Decides, in order to ensure full participation by all Member States in the sessions of the Commission and its working groups, to continue, in the competent Main Committee during the fifty-seventh session of the General Assembly, its consideration of granting travel assistance to the least developed countries that are members of the Commission, at their request and in consultation with the Secretary-General;
	8.	Reiterates, in view of the increased work programme of the Commission, its request to the Secretary-General to strengthen the secretariat of the Commission within the bounds of the resources available in the Organization so as to ensure and enhance the effective implementation of the programme of the Commission, if possible during the current biennium and, in any case, during the biennium 2004-2005.

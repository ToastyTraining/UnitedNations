	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolutions 45/258 of 3 May 1991, 47/218 A of
23 December 1992, 48/226 A of 23 December 1993, 48/226 B of 5 April 1994 and 48/226 C of 29 July 1994, and decisions 48/489 of 8 July 1994 and 49/469 of
23 December 1994,

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the support account for peace-keeping operations 1/ and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Reaffirming the need to continue to improve the administrative and financial management of peace-keeping operations,

		Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary
Questions, 3/ subject to the provisions of the present resolution;

		Decides that support account funds shall be used for the sole purpose of financing human and non-human resource requirements for backstopping and supporting peace-keeping operations at Headquarters, and that any change to this limitation will require the prior approval of the General Assembly;


		Decides also to maintain the current methodology of financing the support account at the rate of 8.5 per cent of the estimated cost of the civilian staff component of each peace-keeping operation, on the understanding that this percentage shall be reviewed annually and for the first time no later than the spring of 1996, taking into account the report to be submitted by the Board of Auditors;

		Affirms that upon the approval of a peace-keeping budget the amounts thus approved with regard to the support account are funds appropriated and therefore available to the Secretary-General, subject to specific use and purpose as specified by the General Assembly;

		Also affirms that the level of resources is clearly a function of the income in the support account and that, therefore, it is the responsibility of the Secretary-General to ensure that, at any one time, the level of income to the support account is not exceeded;

		Decides that once a year, for its consideration and approval, the Secretary-General shall submit to the General Assembly, through the Advisory Committee, a report on the use of the resources in the support account during the past calendar year and on the proposed expenditure for the following twelve-month period beginning 1 July, specifying the proposed establishment of posts and the projected expenditure for non-post requirements by category of expenditure, including, for the former, the grade structure in tabular form;

		Decides also, taking into account the above-mentioned responsibility of the Secretary-General to ensure that expenditure remains within the level of income, to authorize the Secretary-General to redeploy and discontinue posts, according to functional requirements, and requests him to report thereon every six months to the General Assembly for information purposes;

		Decides further that posts funded from the support account shall be filled and managed in compliance with the Charter of the United Nations, the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations, the Staff Regulations and Rules of the United Nations and relevant General Assembly resolutions, including, where appropriate, the classification and advertisement of posts approved for more than ninety days;

	9.	Requests the Board of Auditors to report on an interim basis to the General Assembly by 31 October 1995 on the management of the support account, including, inter alia, the appropriateness of the funding level in view of actual experience, taking into account actions taken by relevant intergovernmental bodies, consistency in the use of human resources for purposes authorized by the Assembly and confirmation that contractual arrangements for the employment of personnel are consistent with the temporary nature of the posts;

	10.	Welcomes the contribution by Member States, on a non-reimbursable basis, of personnel to fill backstopping positions within the Department of Peace-keeping Operations, and reiterates its request to the Secretary-General contained in paragraph 7 of its resolution 48/226 C;

	11.	Authorizes, for the period from 1 July 1995, the continuation of the 346 posts previously authorized, and notes the redeployment of 10 posts
(5 Professional and 5 General Service) from the Finance Management and Support Service of the Field Administration and Logistics Division, Department of Peace-keeping Operations, to the Accounts Division (3 Professional and

2 General Service) and the Peace-keeping Financing Division (2 Professional and 3 General Service), Department of Administration and Management;


	12.	Also authorizes, on an exceptional basis, for the period from
1 July 1995 to 31 January 1996, the conversion of the 61 positions under general temporary assistance to temporary posts exclusively for the purposes proposed by the Secretary-General in his report, 4/ including, inter alia, staffing of the Civilian Police Unit, on the understanding that the contracts for the staff encumbering these posts will terminate on 31 January 1996 unless the General Assembly decides otherwise;


	13.	Decides that further consideration of these staffing requirements will be subject to review during the autumn part of the fiftieth session of the General Assembly, based on additional information provided by the Secretary-General through established procedures on, inter alia, the 61 posts cited in paragraph 12 above (to include, inter alia, an organizational chart reflecting current number, grade and function of posts), and the report by the Board of Auditors requested in paragraph 3 above;

	14.	Authorizes the resources for general temporary assistance, including the position of Special Adviser to the Secretary-General (319,600 United States dollars), overtime (157,500 dollars), travel on official business (90,000 dollars), training (372,500 dollars) and common services (4,028,200 dollars) for the period from 1 April to 31 December 1995.

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly
[on the report of the First Committee (A/57/510)]
57/81.	Consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 51/45 N of 10 December 1996, 52/38 G of 9 December 1997, 53/77 M of 4 December 1998, 54/54 H of 1 December 1999, 55/33 G of 20 November 2000 and 56/24 P of 29 November 2001,
	Convinced that a comprehensive and integrated approach towards certain practical disarmament measures often is a prerequisite to maintaining and consolidating peace and security and thus provides a basis for effective post-conflict peace-building, namely the rehabilitation and social and economic development in areas that have suffered from conflict; such measures are, inter alia, collection and responsible disposal, preferably through destruction, of weapons obtained through illicit trafficking or illicit manufacture as well as of weapons and ammunition declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements, particularly with regard to small arms and light weapons, unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered; confidence-building measures; disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants; demining; and conversion,
	Noting with satisfaction that the international community is more than ever aware of the importance of such practical disarmament measures, especially with regard to the growing problems arising from the excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons, which pose a threat to peace and security and reduce the prospects for economic development in many regions, particularly in post-conflict situations,
	Stressing that further efforts are needed in order to develop and effectively implement programmes of practical disarmament in affected areas as part of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration measures so as to complement, on a case-by-case basis, peacekeeping and peace-building efforts,
	Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on prevention of armed conflict,1 which, inter alia, refers to the role which the proliferation and illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons play in the context of the build-up and sustaining of conflicts and proposes certain measures relating to those weapons that can help to prevent such conflicts, 
	Taking note of the statement by the President of the Security Council of 31 August 20012 underlining the importance of practical disarmament measures in the context of armed conflicts, and, with regard to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, emphasizing the importance of measures to be taken to contain the security risks stemming from the use of illicit small arms and light weapons,
	Also taking note of the report of the Secretary-General prepared with the assistance of the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms,3 and in particular the recommendations contained therein, as an important contribution to the consolidation of the peace process through practical disarmament measures,
	Taking into account the deliberations at the 2001 substantive session of the Disarmament Commission in Working Group II on agenda item 5, entitled "Practical confidence-building measures in the field of conventional arms",4 and encouraging the Disarmament Commission to continue its efforts aimed at the identification of such measures,
	Welcoming the Programme of Action adopted by the United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,5 which should be implemented expeditiously,
	1.	Stresses, in the context of the present resolution, the particular relevance of the "Guidelines on conventional arms control/limitation and disarmament, with particular emphasis on consolidation of peace in the context of General Assembly resolution 51/45 N",6 adopted by the Disarmament Commission by consensus at its 1999 substantive session;
	2.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures, submitted pursuant to resolution 51/45 N,7 and once again encourages Member States, as well as regional arrangements and agencies, to lend their support to the implementation of recommendations contained therein;
	3.	Welcomes the activities undertaken by the group of interested States that was formed in New York in March 1998, and invites the group to continue to analyse lessons learned from previous disarmament and peace-building projects, as well as to promote new practical disarmament measures to consolidate peace, especially as undertaken or designed by affected States themselves;
	4.	Encourages Member States, including the group of interested States, to lend their support to the Secretary-General, relevant international, regional and subregional organizations, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, and non-governmental organizations in responding to requests by Member States to collect and destroy small arms and light weapons in post-conflict situations;
	5.	Thanks the Secretary-General for his report on the implementation of resolution 56/24 P,8 taking into consideration the activities of the group of interested States in this regard;
	6.	Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the United Nations study on disarmament and non-proliferation education;9
	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session a report on the implementation of practical disarmament measures, taking into consideration the activities of the group of interested States in this regard;
	8.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-eighth session the item entitled "Consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures".

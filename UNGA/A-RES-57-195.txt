[on the report of the Third Committee (A/57/554)]
57/195.	The fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to
the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action 


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 52/111 of 12 December 1997, in which it decided to convene the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, and all other resolutions on this matter, 
	Recalling also its resolution 56/266 of 27 March 2002, in which it endorsed the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held at Durban, South Africa, from 31 August to 8 September 2001,1 as constituting a solid foundation for further action and initiatives towards the total elimination of the scourge of racism, 
	Recalling further its resolutions 56/265 and 56/267 of 27 March 2002, on the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination and on measures to combat contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
	Stressing that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 19932 attaches importance to the elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance, 
	Convinced that the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance made an important contribution to achieving the goal of eradicating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that the results of the Conference have to be fully implemented without delay through effective action, 
	Recognizing that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance occur on the grounds of race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin and that victims can suffer multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination based on other related grounds such as sex, language, religion, political and other opinion, social origin, property, birth or other status, 
	Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance reveal themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls and may be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and the limitation or denial of their human rights, and recognizing the need to integrate a gender perspective into relevant policies, strategies and programmes of action against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in order to address multiple forms of discrimination, 
	Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination and the follow-up to the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance,3 
	Taking note of the report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,4 
	Reiterating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and well-being of their societies, and that any doctrine of racial superiority is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and must be rejected, together with theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human races,
	Reaffirming its firm determination and its commitment to eradicate totally and unconditionally racism and racial discrimination and its conviction that racism and racial discrimination constitute a negation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,5 
	Reaffirming also its commitment to a global drive for the total elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, 
	Stressing the need for maintaining political will and momentum at the national, regional and international levels to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, taking into account commitments undertaken under the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, and recalling the importance of enhancing national action and international cooperation to this end, 
	Recognizing that the successful implementation of the Programme of Action requires political will, international cooperation and adequate funding at the national, regional and international levels, 
	Deeply concerned that, despite continuing efforts, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and acts of violence persist and even grow in magnitude, incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to establish policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national superiority or exclusivity, 
	Alarmed, in particular, at the increase in racist violence and xenophobic ideas in many parts of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large, inter alia, as a result of the resurgent activities of associations established on the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters, and the persistent use of those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies, 
	Reaffirming that universal adherence to and full implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination6 are of paramount importance for the promotion of equality and non-discrimination in the world, 
	Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating continuing and violent trends involving racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy, tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication, 
	Recognizing that States should implement and enforce appropriate and effective legislative, judicial, regulatory and administrative measures to prevent and protect against acts of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, thereby contributing to the prevention of human rights violations, 
	Emphasizing that poverty, underdevelopment, marginalization, social exclusion and economic disparities are closely associated with racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and contribute to the persistence of racist attitudes and practices which in turn generate more poverty, 
	Recalling the adoption by the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families,7 
	Conscious of the fact that the history of humanity is replete with major atrocities as a result of gross violations of human rights, and believing that lessons can be learned from history to avert future tragedies,
	Welcoming United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization resolution 31C/28 of 2 November 2001 on the proclamation of 2004 as International Year to Commemorate the Struggle against Slavery and its Abolition,8 and in this context noting that organization's slave route project, 
	Deeply concerned about the misuse, by those advocating racism and racial discrimination, of new communications technologies, including the Internet, to disseminate their repugnant views,

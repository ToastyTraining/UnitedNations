[without reference to a Main Committee (A/58/L.41 and Add.1)]
		58/116.	Economic assistance for the reconstruction and development of Djibouti


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 56/108 of 14 December 2001 and its previous resolutions on economic assistance to Djibouti,
	Recalling also the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1
	Recalling further the Brussels Declaration2 and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010,3 adopted by the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries on 20 May 2001, as well as the mutual commitments undertaken on that occasion and the importance attached to follow-up and the implementation of the Programme of Action,
	Aware that Djibouti is included in the list of least developed countries and that it is ranked 153rd out of the 175 countries studied in the Human Development Report 2003,4
	Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti are constrained by the extremes of the local climate, in particular cyclical droughts, and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the limited capacity of the country,
	Noting also that the situation in Djibouti has been made worse by the disastrous drought situation prevailing in the Horn of Africa and by the absence of natural resources, which continues to place serious constraints on the fragile economic, budgetary, social and administrative infrastructure of the country,
	Expressing its concern at the severe shortage of drinkable water and the dramatic projected figures for the year 2020 as reflected in the report of the Secretary-General,5
	Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti is pursuing the implementation of a reform programme and is about to finalize with the international financial institutions a poverty reduction strategy paper,
	Noting with gratitude the support provided by various countries, as well as intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, to meet the humanitarian needs of the country,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;5
	2.	Declares its solidarity with the Government and the people of Djibouti, who continue to face critical developmental and humanitarian challenges owing, in particular, to the scarcity of natural resources, coupled with harsh climatic conditions and the acute issue of water supply impacting on the development aspirations of the country;
	3.	Encourages the Government of Djibouti, despite difficult economic and regional situations, to continue its serious efforts towards the consolidation of democracy;
	4.	Notes with satisfaction the implementation of a reform programme by Djibouti, and in that context appeals to all Governments, international financial institutions, the specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations to respond adequately to the financial and material needs of the country in line with the poverty reduction strategy paper;
	5.	Expresses its gratitude to the intergovernmental organizations and the specialized agencies of the United Nations for their contributions to the national rehabilitation of Djibouti, and invites them to continue their efforts;
	6.	Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to make the international community aware of the difficulties faced by Djibouti, and welcomes his initiative to appoint a special envoy for humanitarian affairs for the Horn of Africa, with the objective of mobilizing resources for relief support as well as sustainable development;
	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue, in close cooperation with the Government of Djibouti, his efforts to mobilize resources necessary for an effective programme of financial, technical and material assistance to Djibouti;
	8.	Also requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session on the humanitarian situation of Djibouti and on the progress made with regard to economic assistance to Djibouti and the implementation of the present resolution.

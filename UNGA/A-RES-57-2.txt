Africa's Development


	The General Assembly

United Nations Declaration on the New Partnership for 
Africa's Development


1.	We, heads of State and Government and heads of delegations participating in the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly held on 16 September 2002, considered how to support the New Partnership for Africa's Development,1 which is a programme of the African Union. This meeting forms part of the final review and appraisal of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s2 at this, the fifty-seventh session of the Assembly.
2.	We reaffirm our commitment to the United Nations Millennium Declaration, adopted on 8 September 2000,3 and the internationally agreed development goals as the embodiment of our collective desire for and aspiration to a better world in which all peoples can live in dignity and peace. 
3.	We recommit ourselves to meeting the special needs of Africa as recognized in the Millennium Declaration, the ministerial declaration of the high-level segment of the substantive session of 2001 of the Economic and Social Council on the role of the United Nations in support of the efforts of African countries to achieve sustainable development, adopted on 18 July 2001,4 the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development, adopted on 22 March 2002,5 and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, adopted at the Summit on 4 September 2002.
4.	We welcome the New Partnership for Africa's Development, as an African Union-led, -owned and -managed initiative, and recognize that it is a serious commitment to addressing the aspirations of the continent, as decided by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, at its thirty-seventh ordinary session, held at Lusaka from 9 to 11 July 2001.
5.	We welcome the commitment of African countries to take effective and concrete measures, inter alia, through the establishment of various institutional mechanisms and the development of strategies, for the implementation of the New Partnership for Africa's Development. This commitment reflects the recognition that the primary responsibility for the implementation of the New Partnership rests with the African Governments and peoples.
6.	We affirm that international support for the implementation of the New Partnership for Africa's Development is essential. While acknowledging the support so far expressed or provided for the New Partnership, we urge the United Nations system and the international community, in particular donor countries, to assist with the implementation of the New Partnership.
7.	We call upon the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly for the Final Review and Appraisal of the Implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s to consider how the United Nations will structure its support for the New Partnership for Africa's Development and take decisions to this effect.

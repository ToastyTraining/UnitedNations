	9.	Decides also, as an ad hoc arrangement, to apportion among Member States the amount of 172,000 dollars in respect of the period from 1 July to 15 October 1999, in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, and as adjusted by the General Assembly in subsequent resolutions and decisions for the ad hoc apportionment of peacekeeping appropriations, the latest of which were resolution 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and decisions 54/456 to 54/458 of 23 December 1999 in respect of the period 1998-2000, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the year 1999 as set out in its resolution 52/215 A of 22 December 1997;

	11.	Decides that for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force, there shall be set off against the apportionment, as provided for in paragraph 9 above, their respective share in the amount of 172,000 dollars from the unencumbered balance of 7,059,600 dollars;
	12.	Decides also that, for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force, their share of the amount of 172,000 dollars from the unencumbered balance of 7,059,600 dollars shall be set off against their outstanding obligations;
	13.	Decides further that staff assessment income in the amount of 96,000 dollars from the total staff assessment income of 174,100 dollars shall be set off against the credits from the unencumbered balance referred to in paragraphs 11 and 12 above;

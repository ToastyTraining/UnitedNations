	Thanking Member States and the International Committee of the Red Cross for their contribution to the report of the Secretary-General,
	Convinced of the continuing value of established humanitarian rules relating to armed conflicts and the need to respect and ensure respect for these rules in all circumstances within the scope of the relevant international instruments, pending the earliest possible termination of such conflicts,
	Stressing the possibility of making use of the International Fact-Finding Commission in relation to an armed conflict, pursuant to article 90 of Protocol I,2 and recalling that the International Fact-Finding Commission may, where necessary, facilitate, through its good offices, the restoration of an attitude of respect for the Geneva Conventions3 and the Protocol,
	Stressing also the need for consolidating the existing body of international humanitarian law through its universal acceptance and the need for wide dissemination and full implementation of such law at the national level, and expressing concern about all violations of the Geneva Conventions and the two additional Protocols,4
	Noting with satisfaction the increasing number of national commissions and other bodies involved in advising authorities at the national level on the implementation, dissemination and development of international humanitarian law,
	Mindful of the role of the International Committee of the Red Cross in offering protection to the victims of armed conflicts,
	Noting with appreciation the continuing efforts of the International Committee of the Red Cross to promote and disseminate knowledge of international humanitarian law, in particular the Geneva Conventions and the two additional Protocols,
	Recalling that the Twenty-sixth International Conference of the Red Cross and Red Crescent endorsed the recommendations of the Intergovernmental Group of Experts on the Protection of War Victims, including the recommendation that the depositary of the Geneva Conventions should organize periodic meetings of States parties to the Conventions to consider general problems regarding the application of international humanitarian law,

	Noting the celebration in 1999 at The Hague and at St. Petersburg of the centennial of the first International Peace Conference which highlighted the importance of the Geneva Conventions for the protection of victims of armed conflicts and the additional Protocols,
	Acknowledging the fact that the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, adopted on 17 July 1998,7 includes the most serious crimes of international concern under international humanitarian law, and that the Statute, while recalling that it is the duty of every State to exercise its criminal jurisdiction over those responsible for such crimes, shows the determination of the international community to put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of such crimes and thus to contribute to their prevention,
	Noting that international humanitarian law has been an important topic in the United Nations Decade for International Law, which came to an end in 1999, fifty years after the adoption of the Geneva Conventions, and acknowledging the usefulness of discussing in the General Assembly the status of international humanitarian law instruments relevant to the protection of victims of armed conflicts,

	5.	Calls upon all States parties to the Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions to ensure their wide dissemination and full implementation;

Welcomes the advisory service activities of the International Committee of the Red Cross in supporting efforts undertaken by Member States to take legislative and administrative action to implement international humanitarian law and in promoting the exchange of information on those efforts between Governments;
	9.	Welcomes also the increasing numbers of national commissions or committees for the implementation of international humanitarian law and for promoting the incorporation of treaties on international humanitarian law into national law and disseminating the rules of international humanitarian law;
	10.	Welcomes further the adoption of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflicts; 8
	11.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session a report on the status of the additional Protocols relating to the protection of victims of armed conflicts, as well as on measures taken to strengthen the existing body of international humanitarian law, inter alia, with respect to its dissemination and full implementation at the national level, based on information received from Member States and the International Committee of the Red Cross;

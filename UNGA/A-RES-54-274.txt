	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/54/905)]


54/274.   Financing of the Civilian Police Support Group

    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the Civilian Police Support Group1 and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

    Recalling Security Council resolution 1037 (1996) of 15 January 1996, by which the Council established the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium for an initial period of twelve months, and resolution 1145 (1997) of 19 December 1997, in which the Council noted the termination of the Transitional Administration on 15 January 1998 and established, with effect from 16 January 1998, the Civilian Police Support Group for a single period of up to nine months,

    Recalling also its decision 50/481 of 11 April 1996 on the financing of the Transitional Administration and its subsequent resolutions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 53/234 of 8 June 1999,

    Reaffirming that the costs of the Transitional Administration and the Support Group are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations, 

    Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Transitional Administration and the Support Group, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,
    
    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Transitional Administration,

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the account of the missions with the necessary financial resources to enable them to meet their outstanding liabilities,

    1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium and the Civilian Police Support Group as at 30 April 2000, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 29.8 million United States dollars, representing 7 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Transitional Administration to the period ending 30 June 1999, notes that some 29 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

    2.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

    3.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursements to troop contributors that bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

    4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the missions in full;

    5.	Expresses concern at the delay experienced by the Secretary-General in deploying and providing adequate resources to some recent peacekeeping missions, in particular those in Africa;

    6.	Emphasizes that all future and existing peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements;

    7.	Also emphasizes that all peacekeeping missions shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates;

    8.	Endorses the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;3


    9.	Decides that Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration and the Support Group shall be credited their respective share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 601,200 dollars gross (541,500 dollars net) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998 and of the unencumbered balance of 263,160 dollars gross (359,960 dollars net) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1999;

    10.	Decides also that, for Member States that have not fulfilled their obligations to the Transitional Administration and the Support Group, their share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 601,200 dollars gross (541,500 dollars net) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998 and of the unencumbered balance of 263,160 dollars gross (359,960 dollars net) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1999 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations;

    11.	Emphasizes that no peacekeeping mission shall be financed by borrowing funds from other active peacekeeping missions;

    12.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-fifth session the item entitled "Financing of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium and the Civilian Police Support Group".

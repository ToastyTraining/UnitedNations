	The General Assembly,

	Reaffirming the obligation of all States to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, and reaffirming also that discrimination on the basis of sex is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women1 and other international human rights instruments, and that its elimination is an integral part of efforts towards the elimination of all forms of violence against women,
	Reaffirming also the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women,2 the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action,3 the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century",4 and the declaration adopted at the forty-ninth session of the Commission on the Status of Women,5

	Recognizing also that women's poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of sustainable development, can place them at increased risk of violence, and that violence against women impedes the social and economic development of communities and States, as well as the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals,
	Recognizing further that the empowerment of women, by ensuring their full representation and full and equal participation at all levels of decision-making, is important in eliminating violence against women and girls,
	Acknowledging the need to address violence against women holistically, including through the recognition of linkages between violence against women and other issues such as HIV/AIDS, poverty eradication, food security, peace and security, humanitarian assistance, health and crime prevention,
	Expressing its appreciation for the high number of activities undertaken by States to eliminate all forms of violence against women, such as enacting or amending legislation relating to acts of violence against women and adopting comprehensive national action plans to combat such violence, 
	Recognizing the important role of civil society, in particular women's organizations, in the efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women,
	1.	Stresses that "violence against women" means any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life; 
	2.	Recognizes that violence against women and girls persists in every country in the world as a pervasive violation of the enjoyment of human rights and a major impediment to achieving gender equality, development, peace and the internationally agreed development goals, in particular the Millennium Development Goals;
	3.	Expresses its concern about the continuing level of impunity for acts of violence against women worldwide;
	4.

	5.	Welcomes also the efforts and important contributions at the local, national, regional and international levels to eliminate all forms of violence against women, including by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, in particular the second thematic report on violence against women, its causes and consequences submitted by the Special Rapporteur to the Human Rights Council in 2008;11
	6.	Recognizes the important role of the family in preventing and combating violence against women and girls and the need to support its capacity to prevent and combat violence against women;
	7.	Welcomes the launch of the Secretary-General's campaign to end violence against women "UNiTE to End Violence against Women", supported, inter alia, by the United Nations Development Fund for Women advocacy campaign "Say NO to violence against women" and the United Nations inter-agency initiative "Stop Rape Now: United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict", stresses the need to ensure that concrete follow-up activities will be undertaken by the United Nations system to intensify action to end violence against women, in close consultation with existing system-wide activities on violence against women, and requests the Secretary-General to identify, announce and report on the basis of the expected results of his campaign;
	8.

	9.	Stresses that it is important that States strongly condemn all forms of violence against women and refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination as set out in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women;2
	10.	Stresses also that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls and must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of violence against women and girls and to provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms;
	11.	Urges States to end impunity for violence against women by investigating, prosecuting with due process and punishing all perpetrators, by ensuring that women have equal protection of the law and equal access to justice and by holding up to public scrutiny and eliminating those attitudes that foster, justify or tolerate all forms of violence against women and girls;
	12.	Reaffirms that the persistence of armed conflicts in various parts of the world is a major impediment to the elimination of all forms of violence against women, and, bearing in mind that armed and other types of conflicts and terrorism and hostage-taking still persist in many parts of the world and that aggression, foreign occupation and ethnic and other types of conflicts are an ongoing reality affecting women and men in nearly every region, calls upon all States and the international community to place particular focus on and give priority attention and increased assistance to the plight and suffering of women and girls living in such situations and to ensure that, where violence is committed against them, all perpetrators of such violence are duly investigated and, as appropriate, prosecuted and punished in order to end impunity, while stressing the need to respect international humanitarian law and human rights law;
	13.	Stresses the need for the exclusion of the killing and maiming of women and girls, as prohibited under international law, and sexual violence crimes from amnesty provisions in the context of conflict resolution processes;
	14.	Stresses also that States should take measures to ensure that all officials responsible for implementing policies and programmes aimed at preventing violence against women, protecting and assisting the victims, and investigating and punishing violence against women, receive proper training to sensitize them to the different and specific needs of women, in particular women who have been subjected to violence, so that women are not revictimized when seeking justice and redress;
	15.	Stresses further that States should take all possible measures to empower women and inform them of their rights in seeking redress through mechanisms of justice, inform everyone of women's rights and of the existing penalties for violating those rights, and engage men and boys, as well as families, as agents of change in preventing and condemning violence against women;
	16.	Urges States to continue to develop their national strategy and a more systematic, comprehensive, multisectoral and sustained approach aimed at eliminating all forms of violence against women, including by achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women, and by using best practices to end impunity and a culture of tolerance towards violence against women, inter alia, in the fields of legislation, prevention, law enforcement, victim assistance and rehabilitation, such as:

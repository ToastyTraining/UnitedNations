	Having considered the updated matrix for 2002 contained in the report of the Secretary-General2 on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa,3
	Recalling its resolution 57/7 of 4 November 2002 on the final review and appraisal of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s and support for the New Partnership for Africa's Development,

	Recalling section VII of the United Nations Millennium Declaration,4 which highlights the special needs of Africa,
	Reaffirming that the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa must remain a priority on the agenda of the United Nations system and of the Member States,
	Underscoring the fact that the responsibility for peace and security in Africa, including the capacity to address the root causes of conflict and to resolve conflicts in a peaceful manner, lies primarily with African countries themselves and with regional and subregional structures,
	Underscoring also the need to strengthen further the political will to ensure the required political, financial and technical support critical for the effective implementation of the recommendations in all of the areas included in the report of the Secretary-General,
	Reaffirming that the General Assembly must continue to play the primary role in monitoring the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General and assessing the progress made,5
	1.	Takes note with appreciation of the updated matrix for 2002 contained in the report of the Secretary-General2 on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa,3 and the further advances in a wide range of areas made since the last progress report;

	8.	Notes with concern that progress in the implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Secretary-General remains slow and uneven;
	9.	Notes that conflict prevention and peace consolidation efforts, in particular efforts to eradicate poverty, promote respect for human rights, strengthen rule-of-law institutions, re-establish transparent and accountable public administration, encourage democratic reform and demobilize, disarm and reintegrate ex-combatants should be supported by Member States and the United Nations system through enhanced coordination, coherence and sustained financial and political support;
	10.	Decides to continue to monitor the implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa;3

	12.	Calls upon Member States to provide financial and technical assistance in a coordinated and sustained way in order to support activities to eradicate poverty, promote respect for human rights, strengthen rule of law institutions and promote transparent and accountable public administration;
	13.

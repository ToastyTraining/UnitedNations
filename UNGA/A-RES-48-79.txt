	Recalling the commitment by the States that are parties to the Convention and the Protocols annexed thereto to respect the objectives and the provisions thereof, especially those set forth in the ninth preambular paragraph of the Convention, relating to the wish to prohibit or restrict further the use of certain conventional weapons and believing that the positive results achieved in this area may facilitate the main talks on disarmament with a view to putting an end to the production, stockpiling and proliferation of such weapons,

	Noting with satisfaction that a State party has asked the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene, in conformity with article 8, paragraph 3, of the Convention,  a conference to review the Convention and the Protocols annexed thereto, giving priority to the question of anti-personnel land mines,

	Noting that international meetings have discussed possible restrictions of the use of other weapon categories presently not covered by the Convention and the Protocols annexed thereto,

	Reaffirming its conviction that a general and verifiable agreement on prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons would significantly reduce the suffering of civilians and combatants,

	Being desirous of reinforcing international cooperation in the area of prohibitions or restrictions on the use of certain conventional weapons, and particularly for the removal of minefields, mines and booby-traps,

	Recalling in this respect resolution 48/7 of 19 October 1993 on assistance in mine clearance,

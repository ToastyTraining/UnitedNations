	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[without reference to a Main Committee (A/53/L.67)]


53/168.Fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling that the Charter of the United Nations reaffirms the faith of the United Nations in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small,

	Recognizing the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations as well as the source of inspiration and a basis of subsequent progress in the field of human rights,

	Concerned that human rights and fundamental freedoms are not fully and universally respected and continue to be violated in all parts of the world, and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights and that some peoples still lack the full enjoyment of their right of self-determination,

	Stressing the necessity for further national efforts as well as enhanced international cooperation, with a view to fully realizing all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the need to promote greater awareness of the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in other international human rights instruments,


	Reaffirming that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, and that the international community must treat them globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis,

	Reaffirming also the need to ensure full observance of the human rights of women and the girl child as an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of all human rights and fundamental freedoms,

	Reaffirming further the need for the international community to continue to review and assess the progress made in the field of human rights since the adoption of the Declaration and to identify obstacles and ways in which they can be overcome,

	Mindful that everyone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be fully realized,

	Declares solemnly its commitment to the fulfilment of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations and as a source of inspiration for the further promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms - political, economic, social, civil and cultural - including the right to development.

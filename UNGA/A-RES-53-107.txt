    Stressing that, in the formulation of sanctions regimes, due account should be taken of the potential effects of sanctions on third States,

    Recognizing that assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions would further contribute to an effective and comprehensive approach by the international community to sanctions imposed by the Security Council,

    Recognizing also that the international community at large and, in particular, international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter, in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States,

    2.	Welcomes once again the further measures taken by the Security Council since the adoption of General Assembly resolution 50/51and aimed at increasing the effectiveness and transparency of the sanctions committees, invites the Council to implement those measures, and strongly recommends that the Council continue its efforts to enhance further the functioning of the sanctions committees, to streamline their working procedures and to facilitate access to them by representatives of States that find themselves confronted with special economic problems arising from the carrying out of sanctions;

    3.

    5.	Reaffirms the important role of the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Committee for Programme and Coordination in mobilizing and monitoring, as appropriate, the economic assistance efforts by the international community and the United Nations system to States confronted with special economic problems arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures imposed by the Security Council and, as appropriate, in identifying solutions to the special economic problems of those States, and decides to transmit the report of the ad hoc expert group meeting to the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1999;

    6.	Invites the organizations of the United Nations system, international financial institutions, other international organizations, regional organizations and Member States to address more specifically and directly, where appropriate, special economic problems of third States affected by sanctions imposed under Chapter VII of the Charter and, for this purpose, to consider improving procedures for consultations to maintain a constructive dialogue with such States, including through regular and frequent meetings as well as, where appropriate, special meetings between the affected third States and the donor community, with the participation of United Nations agencies and other international organizations;


    7.	Requests the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization, at its session in 1999, to continue to consider on a priority basis the question of the implementation of the provisions of the Charter related to assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter, taking into consideration all the related reports of the Secretary-General, in particular the most recent report containing a summary of the deliberations and main findings of the ad hoc expert group meeting convened pursuant to paragraph 4 of General Assembly resolution 52/162, the proposals submitted on this question, the debate on the question in the Sixth Committee during the fifty-third session of the General Assembly and the text on the question of sanctions imposed by the United Nations contained in annex II to General Assembly resolution 51/242, as well as the implementation of the provisions of General Assembly resolutions 50/51, 51/208, 52/162 and the present resolution;

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/52/547)]


52/8.Financing of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission and financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolutions 626 (1988) of 20 December 1988, by which the Council established the United Nations Angola Verification Mission, 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991, by which the Council decided to entrust a new mandate to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (thenceforth called the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II), 976 (1995) of 8 February 1995, by which the Council authorized the establishment of a peacekeeping operation (thenceforth called the United Nations Angola Verification Mission III) and 1118 (1997) of 30 June 1997, by which the Council decided to establish, as from 1 July 1997, the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola for an initial period of four months until 31 October 1997,

	Recalling its resolution 43/231 of 16 February 1989 on the financing of the Verification Mission and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 51/213 of 18 December 1996,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Observer Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,


	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Observer Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	Concerned that the Secretary-General continues to face difficulties in meeting the obligations of the Mission on a current basis, including reimbursement to current and former troop-contributing States,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission as at 15 October 1997, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 89,144,761 United States dollars, representing 10 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Verification Mission to the period ending 30 June 1997, notes that some 26 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear an additional burden owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

	4.	Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure the payment of their assessed contributions to the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola in full and on time;

	5.	Takes note of the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;2

	6.	Decides to maintain the posts of Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General and Chief Administrative Officer at their originally authorized levels, and approves the reclassification of the post of Chief of the Human Rights Division at the D-1 level;

	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Observer Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

	8.	Also requests the Secretary-General, in order to reduce the cost of employing General Service staff, to take the necessary steps to employ locally recruited staff for the Observer Mission against General Service posts, commensurate with the operational requirements of such posts, and to report on this matter to the General Assembly;

	9.	Further requests the Secretary-General to entrust to the Office of Internal Oversight Services the preparation of a report to the General Assembly, at the first part of its resumed fifty-second session, on the audit findings on the procurement process in the Verification Mission and to provide a written report to the Assembly, at the second part of its resumed fifty-second session, on efforts to recover losses and corrective measures taken;

	10.	Decides to continue to use the Special Account for the United Nations Angola Verification Mission, established in accordance with General Assembly resolution 43/231, for the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola beginning 1 July 1997;

	11.	Decides also that the proposed 25 per cent reduction in the civilian establishment is not commensurate with the nearly 94 per cent reduction in the military component, and that, in the absence of adequate justification, the proposed civilian establishment should be reduced by at least 10 per cent;

	12.	Decides further to appropriate the amount of 155 million dollars gross (150,371,600 dollars net) for the operation of the Observer Mission for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998, inclusive of the amount of 49,975,500 dollars gross (48,202,500 dollars net) authorized by the Advisory Committee for the period from 1 July to 31 October 1997;

	13.	Decides, as an ad hoc arrangement, to apportion the amount of 76,054,200 dollars gross (74,362,800 dollars net) for the period from 1 July to 31 October 1997 among Member States, in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996 and 51/218 A and B of 18 December 1996 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and 50/451 B and 50/471 A of 23 December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the year 1997, as set out in its resolution 49/19 B of 23 December 1994;

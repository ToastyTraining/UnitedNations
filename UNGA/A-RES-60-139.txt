[on the report of the Third Committee (A/60/503)]

60/139.	Violence against women migrant workers


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling all of its previous resolutions on violence against women migrant workers and those adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women, the Commission on Human Rights and the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, and the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women,1 
	Reaffirming the provisions concerning women migrant workers contained in the outcome documents of the World Conference on Human Rights,2 the International Conference on Population and Development,3 the Fourth World Conference on Women4 and the World Summit for Social Development5 and their five-year reviews,
	Noting with appreciation the various activities initiated by entities of the United Nations system, such as the Regional Programme on Empowering Women Migrant Workers in Asia of the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the high-level panel discussion held by the Commission on the Status of Women at its forty-ninth session on the integration of gender perspectives in macroeconomics, which included a discussion on the protection of women migrant workers, as well as other activities through which the plight of women migrant workers continues to be assessed and alleviated,
	Recognizing the increasing feminization of international migration, which requires greater gender sensitivity in all policies and efforts related to the subject of international migration,
	Noting the large numbers of women from developing countries and some countries with economies in transition who continue to venture forth to more affluent countries in search of a living for themselves and their families as a consequence of poverty, unemployment and other socio-economic conditions, and acknowledging the duty of the countries of origin, in cooperation with the international community, to try to create conditions that provide employment and economic security for their citizens,
	Acknowledging the economic benefits that accrue to both the country of origin and the country of destination from the employment of women migrant workers,
	Expressing deep concern at the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against women migrant workers, including, inter alia, sexual and gender-based violence, trafficking, domestic and family violence, racist and xenophobic acts and abusive labour practices,
	Noting the tendency of many migrant women to be employed in the informal economy and in less skilled work compared with that of men, which puts those women at greater risk of abuse and exploitation,
	Emphasizing the need for objective, comprehensive and broad-based information, possibly including a database for research and analysis, and a wide exchange of experience and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers,
	Encouraging the continuing participation of civil society in developing and implementing appropriate measures to support innovative partnerships among public agencies, non-governmental organizations and other members of civil society for combating violence against women migrant workers,
	Realizing that the movement of a significant number of women migrant workers may be facilitated and made possible by means of fraudulent or irregular documentation and sham marriages with the object of migration, that this may be facilitated through, among other things, the Internet, and that those women migrant workers are more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation,
	Recognizing the importance of joint and collaborative approaches and strategies at the bilateral, regional, interregional and international levels in protecting and promoting the rights and welfare of women migrant workers, 
	Recognizing also the importance of exploring the link between migration and trafficking in order to further efforts towards protecting women migrant workers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse,
	Encouraged by some measures adopted by some countries of destination to alleviate the plight of women migrant workers residing in their areas of jurisdiction, such as the establishment of protection mechanisms for migrant workers, facilitating their access to mechanisms for reporting complaints or providing assistance during legal proceedings,
	Underlining the important role of relevant United Nations treaty bodies in monitoring the implementation of human rights conventions and the relevant special procedures, within their respective mandates, in addressing the problem of violence against women migrant workers and in protecting and promoting their rights and welfare,

	10.	Calls upon concerned Governments, in particular those of the countries of origin and destination, if they have not done so, to put in place penal and criminal sanctions to punish perpetrators of violence against women migrant workers and, to the extent possible, to provide, and to encourage non-governmental organizations to provide, victims of violence with the full range of immediate assistance and protection, such as counselling, legal and consular assistance, temporary shelter and other measures that will allow them to be present during the judicial process, as well as to establish reintegration and rehabilitation schemes for returning women migrant workers to their countries of origin;
	11.	Encourages concerned Governments, in particular those of the countries of origin and destination, to support and, if they have not done so, to formulate and implement training programmes for their law enforcers, prosecutors and service providers with a view to instilling among those public-sector workers the necessary skills and attitude to ensure the delivery of proper and professional interventions for women migrant workers who are subjected to abuse and violence;
	12.	Also encourages concerned Governments to adopt measures or strengthen existing ones that protect the human rights of women migrant workers, regardless of their immigration status, including, inter alia, in policies that regulate the recruitment and deployment of women migrant workers and appropriate legal measures against intermediaries who deliberately encourage the clandestine movement of workers and who exploit women migrant workers, so as to reduce the vulnerability of migrant women to exploitation, ill treatment and trafficking, and to consider expanding dialogue among States on devising innovative methods to promote legal channels of migration, inter alia, in order to deter illegal migration;
	13.	Invites Governments, the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations to cooperate towards a better understanding of the problems of women and international migration, including to improve the collection, dissemination and analysis of the kind of data that can explain the causes and consequences of those problems, explore the links between migration and trafficking, and identify the causes of undocumented migration and its economic, social and demographic impact, as well as its implications for the formulation and application of social, economic and migration policies, including those relating to women migrant workers;

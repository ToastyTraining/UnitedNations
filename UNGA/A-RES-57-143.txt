	The General Assembly,
	Recalling the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ("the Convention"),1 and bearing in mind the relationship between the Convention and the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks ("the Agreement"),2
	Recalling also its resolution 56/13 of 28 November 2001, and bearing in mind its resolution 57/142 of 12 December 2002,
	Recognizing that, in accordance with the Convention, the Agreement sets forth provisions concerning the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, including provisions on subregional and regional cooperation in enforcement, binding dispute settlement and the rights and obligations of States in authorizing the use of vessels flying their flags for fishing on the high seas,
	Welcoming the entry into force of the Agreement, and noting that the entry into force of the Agreement entails responsibilities for States parties and other important considerations as outlined in the Agreement,
	Welcoming also the outcomes of the World Summit on Sustainable Development,3 in particular those relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks,
	Deploring the fact that the straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in many parts of the world are overfished or subject to sparsely regulated and heavy fishing efforts, mainly as a result of, inter alia, unauthorized fishing, inadequate regulatory measures and excess fishing capacity,
	Recognizing that insufficient monitoring, control and surveillance measures and inadequate flag State control over vessels fishing for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks in many parts of the world exacerbate the problem of overfishing, and recognizing also the urgent need for capacity-building in monitoring, control and surveillance measures and addressing inadequate flag State control for developing States, in particular the least developed among them and small island developing States,
	Noting the obligation of all States, pursuant to the provisions of the Convention, to cooperate in the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks,
	Conscious that the Agreement requires States, and entities referred to in the Convention and in article 1, paragraph 2 (b), of the Agreement, to pursue cooperation in relation to straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, taking into account the specific characteristics of the subregion or region, to ensure the effective conservation, management and long-term sustainability of such stocks, and to establish such organizations or arrangements where none exist,
	Recognizing the obligation of States to cooperate, either directly or through subregional, regional or global organizations, to enhance the ability of developing States, in particular the least developed among them and small island developing States, to conserve and manage straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and to develop their own fisheries for such stocks,
	Calling attention to the circumstances affecting fisheries in many developing States, in particular African States and small island developing States,
	Taking into account that, in accordance with the Convention, the Agreement and the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,4 States fishing for straddling fish stocks or highly migratory fish stocks on the high seas, and relevant coastal States, shall give effect to their duty to cooperate either directly or by becoming members of the subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or participants in arrangements of that nature, or by agreeing to apply the conservation and management measures established by such organizations or arrangements, and that States having a real interest in the fisheries concerned may become members of such organizations or participants in such arrangements,
	Recognizing the importance of the Agreement for the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and the need for the regular consideration by the General Assembly of developments relating thereto,
	Noting the outcomes of the first informal consultations of States parties to the Agreement, and taking into account the recommendations to the General Assembly by the States parties that participated in that meeting,5
	Emphasizing that, as recognized during the first informal consultations of States parties to the Agreement, implementation of the provisions in Part VII of the Agreement is fundamental to the successful implementation of the Agreement and, in particular, to assisting developing States, in particular the least developed among them and small island developing States, in meeting their obligations and realizing their rights under the Agreement,
	Welcoming the conclusion of negotiations, and the ongoing preparatory work, to establish new regional instruments, arrangements and organizations in several heretofore unmanaged fisheries, and noting the role of the Convention and the Agreement, while taking into account the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, in the elaboration of these instruments, arrangements and organizations,
	Welcoming also the fact that a growing number of States, and entities referred to in the Convention and in article 1, paragraph 2 (b), of the Agreement, as well as regional and subregional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, have enacted legislation, established regulations, adopted conventions or taken other measures as steps towards implementation of the provisions of the Agreement,
	1.	Expresses its deep satisfaction at the entry into force of the Agreement;2
	2.	Calls upon all States, and entities referred to in the Convention1 and in article 1, paragraph 2 (b), of the Agreement, that have not done so to ratify or accede to it and to consider applying it provisionally;
	3.	Calls upon all States that have not done so, in order to achieve the goal of universal participation, to become parties to the Convention, which sets out the legal framework within which all activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out, taking into account the relationship between the Convention and the Agreement;
	4.	Reaffirms the outcomes of the World Summit on Sustainable Development,3 in particular those relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks;
	5.	Emphasizes the importance of the effective implementation of the provisions of the Agreement, including those provisions relating to bilateral, regional and subregional cooperation in enforcement, and urges continued efforts in this regard;
	6.	Urges all States, and entities referred to in the Convention and in article 1, paragraph 2 (b), of the Agreement, to pursue cooperation in relation to straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, either directly or through appropriate subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements, to ensure the effective conservation, management and long-term sustainability of such stocks, to agree upon measures necessary to coordinate and, where there are no subregional or regional fisheries management organizations or arrangements in respect of particular straddling or highly migratory fish stocks, to cooperate to establish such organizations or enter into other appropriate arrangements;
	7.	Welcomes the initiation of negotiations and ongoing preparatory work to establish regional and subregional fisheries management organizations or arrangements in several fisheries, and urges participants in those negotiations to apply provisions of the Convention and the Agreement to their work;

	9.	Invites States and international financial institutions and organizations of the United Nations system to provide assistance according to Part VII of the Agreement, including, if appropriate, the development of special financial mechanisms or instruments to assist developing States, in particular the least developed among them and small island developing States, to enable them to develop their national capacity to exploit fishery resources, including developing their domestically flagged fishing fleet, value-added processing and the expansion of their economic base in the fishing industry, consistent with the duty to ensure the proper conservation and management of those fisheries resources;
	10.	Invites States and relevant intergovernmental organizations to develop projects, programmes and partnerships with relevant stakeholders and mobilize resources for the effective implementation of the outcome of the African Process for the Protection and Development of the Marine and Coastal Environment, and to consider the inclusion of fisheries components in this work;
	11.	Also invites States and relevant intergovernmental organizations to further implement sustainable fisheries management and improve financial returns from fisheries by supporting and strengthening relevant regional fisheries management organizations, as appropriate, such as the recently established Caribbean Regional Fisheries Mechanism and such agreements as the Convention on the Conservation and Management of Highly Migratory Fish Stocks in the Western and Central Pacific;
	12.	Recognizes the benefits of developing a programme of assistance with multiple components in accordance with Part VII of the Agreement, to complement programmes at the bilateral, subregional, regional and global levels;

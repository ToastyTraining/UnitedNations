	Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political, economic and social realities of each of them, in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation,

	Aware of the fact that the promotion, protection and full exercise of all human rights and fundamental freedoms as legitimate concerns of the world community should be guided by the principles of universality, non-selectivity, impartiality and objectivity and should not be used for political ends,

[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/64/595)]
64/249.	Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of United Nations peacekeeping operations


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 55/235 and 55/236 of 23 December 2000, 58/256 of 23 December 2003 and 61/243 of 22 December 2006, 
	Recalling also its request to the Secretary-General, in paragraph 15 of resolution 55/235, to update the composition of the levels of contribution of Member States for peacekeeping operations described in the resolution on a triennial basis, in conjunction with the regular budget scale of assessment reviews, in accordance with the criteria established in the resolution, and to report thereon to the General Assembly, 
	Recalling further its decision, in paragraph 16 of resolution 55/235, to review the structure of levels of contribution for peacekeeping operations after nine years, 
	Reaffirming the principles set out in its resolutions 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, 3101 (XXVIII) of 11 December 1973 and 55/235, 
	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of resolutions 55/235 and 55/236,1 
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General1 and of the updated composition of levels of contribution for peacekeeping operations for the period 2010 to 2012 contained therein; 2
	2.	Reaffirms the following general principles underlying the financing of United Nations peacekeeping operations: 
	(a)	The financing of such operations is the collective responsibility of all States Members of the United Nations and, accordingly, the costs of peacekeeping operations are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations; 
	(b)	In order to meet the expenditures caused by such operations, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures under the regular budget of the United Nations; 
	(c)	Whereas the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions to peacekeeping operations, the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards peacekeeping operations involving heavy expenditures; 
	(d)	The special responsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council for the maintenance of peace and security should be borne in mind in connection with their contributions to the financing of peace and security operations; 
	(e)	Where circumstances warrant, the General Assembly should give special consideration to the situation of any Member States which are victims of, and those which are otherwise involved in, the events or actions leading to a peacekeeping operation; 
	3.	Also reaffirms that assessment rates for the financing of peacekeeping operations should be based on the scale of assessments for the regular budget of the United Nations, with an appropriate and transparent system of adjustments based on the levels of Member States, consistent with the principles outlined above;
	4.	Further reaffirms that the permanent members of the Security Council should form a separate level and that, consistent with their special responsibilities for the maintenance of peace and security, they should be assessed at a higher rate than for the regular budget;
	5.	Affirms that all discounts resulting from adjustments to the regular budget assessment rates of Member States in levels C through J shall be borne on a pro rata basis by the permanent members of the Security Council;
	6.	Reaffirms that the least developed countries should be placed in a separate level and receive the highest rate of discount available under the scale;
	7.	Also reaffirms that the statistical data used for setting the rates of assessment for peacekeeping should be the same as the data used in preparing the regular budget scale of assessments, subject to the provisions of the present resolution;
	8.	Further reaffirms the decision to create levels of discount to facilitate automatic, predictable movement between categories on the basis of the per capita gross national income of Member States;
	9.	Decides that, as from 1 January 2010, the rates of assessment for peacekeeping should be based on the ten levels of contribution and parameters set forth in the table below, subject to the provisions of the present resolution:

	10.	Reaffirms that Member States will be assigned to the lowest level of contribution with the highest discount for which they are eligible, unless they indicate a decision to move to a higher level;
	11.	Also reaffirms that for purposes of determining the eligibility of Member States for contribution in particular levels during the 2010-2012 scale period, the average per capita gross national income of all Member States will be 6,708 United States dollars and the per capita gross national income of Member States will be the average of 2002 to 2007 figures;
	12.	Further reaffirms that transition periods of two years will apply to countries moving up by two levels, and that transition periods of three years will apply to countries moving up by three or more levels without prejudice to paragraph 10 above;
	13.	Reaffirms that transitions as specified above will occur in equal increments over the transition period as designated above;

	17.	Also recognizes the need to review the structure of the levels of the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of United Nations peacekeeping operations;
	18.	Desires to address the issues referred to above in an effective and expeditious manner;
	19.	Decides to review the structure of the levels of the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of United Nations peacekeeping operations with a view to a decision, if agreed, no later than at its sixty-seventh session.

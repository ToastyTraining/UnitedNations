	Recalling also its decision 55/452 of 23 December 2000 to convene the post-Phase V Working Group,
	Recalling further its resolution 55/274 of 14 June 2001, in which the Secretary-General was requested to convene in 2004 an open-ended working group of experts, for a period of no less than ten working days, to hold a triennial review of reimbursement rates for contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment, including medical services,
	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General,1 on the processing of claims for equipment contributed and self-sustainment undertaken at peacekeeping missions, on the reform of the procedures for determining reimbursement to Member States for contingent-owned equipment and troop costs, and on the practical aspects of wet-lease, dry-lease and self-sustainment arrangements and the section of the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions2 on the management of contingent-owned equipment arrangements,
	1.	Takes note of the reports of the Secretary-General;1
	2.	Also takes note of the observations and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions on the management of contingent-owned equipment arrangements, as contained in paragraphs 60 to 76 of its report;2
	3.	Affirms the importance of conducting peacekeeping operations with the maximum of efficiency and effectiveness and the need to minimize delays in processing reimbursements to troop- and equipment-contributing countries; 
	4.	Recognizes the fact that delay and uncertainty in reimbursements to troop-contributing countries of troop and contingent-owned equipment costs adversely affect the ability of current and potential troop-contributing countries to participate effectively in United Nations peacekeeping operations, and in this context emphasizes the need for all Member States to pay their assessed contributions to all peacekeeping operations in full, on time and without conditions; 
	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit a comprehensive report, taking into account, inter alia, the observations of the Advisory Committee and based on the experience gained so far, and make suggestions for any modification to the current reporting cycle to the Working Group on Reimbursement of Contingent-owned Equipment at its forthcoming meeting, scheduled for February 2004;
	6.	Also requests the Secretary-General to submit a comprehensive report, on the basis of recommendations of the Working Group, on issues that would require legislative action by the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session.

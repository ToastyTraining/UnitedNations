	Reaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development", in which it adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for the full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental - in a balanced and integrated manner, and to building upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking to address their unfinished business, 
	Reaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports and complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with concrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to address the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels for sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity,

	Recognizing that, notwithstanding the opportunities brought by globalization, major challenges still remain to be addressed through multilateralism, 
	Noting that challenges regarding the balance of the global economic system remain, as well as socioeconomic gaps both between countries and within them, and that the gains from globalization, while reducing extreme poverty by half, have been unevenly distributed, giving rise to extreme global inequality over the past 30 years, and acknowledging that growth has also been uneven, intermittent and often unsustainable, punctuated by damaging financial shocks and crises, and that many nations and peoples are still left behind, 
	Stressing the importance of inclusiveness within the United Nations development system and that no one is left behind and no country is left behind in the implementation of the present resolution,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Trade and Development Board of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development1 and the report of the Secretary-General;2
	2.	Recognizes that Member States will not be able to achieve the ambitious Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development3 without a revitalized and enhanced global partnership and comparably ambitious means of implementation, and that a revitalized global partnership will facilitate an intensive global engagement in support of the implementation of all the Goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda, bringing together Governments, civil society, the private sector, the United Nations system and other actors and mobilizing all available resources; 
	3.	Reaffirms the commitments made through the adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development4 in, inter alia, international trade as an important action area for sustainable development;

	5.	Recognizes that, at the Tenth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, held in Nairobi from 15 to 19 December 2015, and as stated in the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration, many members of the World Trade Organization reaffirmed the Doha Development Agenda and the declarations and decisions adopted at Doha and at the Ministerial Conferences held since then, and also reaffirmed their full commitment to conclude the Doha Development Agenda on that basis, while other members did not reaffirm the Doha mandates as they believe that new approaches are necessary to achieve meaningful outcomes in multilateral negotiations, and that members of the World Trade Organization have different views on how to address the negotiations and acknowledge its strong legal structure; 
	6.	Also recognizes that, as stated in the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration, there remains a strong commitment on the part of all members of the World Trade Organization to advance negotiations on the remaining Doha issues, including advancing work in all three pillars of agriculture, namely, domestic support, market access and export competition, as well as non-agricultural market access, services, development, the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) and the rules of the World Trade Organization, and that the work on all the decisions adopted in part II of the Nairobi Ministerial Declaration will remain an important element of the future agenda of the World Trade Organization;

	10.	Emphasizes that accession to the World Trade Organization remains an integral part of the development strategies of most countries aiming to benefit fully from the international trading system, and that it is also important for the further integration of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries and countries with economies in transition, into the rules-based multilateral trading system, that, in this context, acceding countries, particularly the least developed countries, need technical assistance prior to, during and in the follow-up to the accession process, within which obstacles should be addressed so as to facilitate the accession process, in order to achieve its early conclusion, and, with regard to acceding least developed countries, that the members of the World Trade Organization have agreed to implement the guidelines and the decision of 25 July 2012 of the General Council of the World Trade Organization on accession of least developed countries;

	12.

	21.	Welcomes the launch of the "eTrade for All" initiative at the fourteenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held in Nairobi from 17 to 22 July 2016, which seeks to provide a new approach to trade development through electronic exchanges by allowing developing countries to more easily navigate the supply of technical assistance for building capacity in 
e-commerce readiness and by enabling donors to obtain a clear picture of programmes that they could fund; 
	22.	Recognizes that international trade and investment offers opportunities but also requires complementary actions at the national level, commits to strengthening domestic enabling environments and the implementation of sound domestic policies and reforms conducive to realizing the potential of trade for inclusive growth and sustainable development, and recognizes the need for value addition by developing countries and for further integration of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises into value chains; 
	23.	Stresses the importance of women's and girls' equal rights and opportunities in political and economic decision-making and resource allocation and of removing any barriers that prevent women from being full participants in the economy, and in this regard urges Member States, the entities of the United Nations system and other international actors to take the actions required to address specific challenges to the equal and active participation of women-owned companies in international trade, including enhancing access to education and finance, increasing skills and knowledge and securing an enabling environment at all levels;

	27.	Recognizes the commitment to continue to address the needs of small, vulnerable economies and to favourably consider the adoption of such measures as would facilitate their fuller integration into the multilateral trading system, taking into account the needs of small, vulnerable economies in all areas of negotiations, without creating a subcategory of members of the World Trade Organization, and in this regard encourages progress on the implementation of the World Trade Organization work programme on small economies, which supports their efforts towards sustainable development, as also reflected in the outcome document of the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States, the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway;7

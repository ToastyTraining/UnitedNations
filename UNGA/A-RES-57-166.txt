	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 56/116 of 19 December 2001, by which it proclaimed the ten-year period beginning on 1 January 2003 the United Nations Literacy Decade,
	Recalling also the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 in which Member States resolved to ensure that, by the year 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling and that girls and boys will have equal access to all levels of education, which requires a renewed commitment to promote literacy for all,

	Convinced that literacy is crucial to the acquisition, by every child, youth and adult, of the essential life skills that enable them to address the challenges they can face in life, and represents an essential step in basic education, which is an indispensable means for effective participation in the societies and economies of the twenty-first century,
	Affirming that the realization of the right to education, especially for girls, contributes to the eradication of poverty,
	Deeply concerned about the persistence of the gender gap in education, which is reflected by the fact that nearly two thirds of the world's adult illiterates are women,

	2.	Welcomes the International Plan of Action for the United Nations Literacy Decade;

	4.	Urges all Governments to take the lead in coordinating the activities of the Decade at the national level, bringing all relevant national actors together in a sustained dialogue on policy formulation, implementation and evaluation of literacy efforts;
	5.	Appeals to all Governments and professional organizations to strengthen national and professional educational institutions in their countries with a view to expanding their capacity and promoting the quality of education;
	6.	Appeals to all Governments and to economic and financial organizations and institutions, both national and international, to lend greater financial and material support to the efforts to increase literacy and achieve the goals of education for all and those of the Decade, through, inter alia, the 20/20 initiative,3 as appropriate;
	7.	Invites Member States, the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, as well as relevant intergovernmental and non- governmental organizations, to intensify their efforts to implement effectively the International Plan of Action;
	8.	Decides that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization should take a coordinating role in stimulating and catalysing the activities undertaken at the international level within the framework of the Decade in a manner that is complementary to and coordinated with the ongoing process of education for all;
	9.	Requests the Secretary-General, in cooperation with the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, to prepare a report on the implementation of the International Plan of Action for submission to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session;

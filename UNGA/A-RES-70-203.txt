	1	See resolution 64/200.
	2	The designation of 5 November comes from the "Inamura-no-hi" anecdote about a villager who, on 5 November 1854, at the expense of his property, saved the lives of village inhabitants by setting fire to his sheaves of rice, thus quickly disseminating information about a tsunami, leading to the evacuation of the village, which he then made an effort to build back better.

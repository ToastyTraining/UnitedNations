Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 23 December 2003
[without reference to a Main Committee (A/58/L.54)]
		58/236.	Follow-up to the outcome of the twenty-sixth special session: implementation of the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling the goals and targets set forth in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS1 adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-sixth special session, in 2001, and the HIV/AIDS-related goals contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration of 2000,2
	Reaffirming the commitment made by all States at the twenty-sixth special session of the General Assembly,
	Noting with profound concern that 42 million people worldwide are living with HIV/AIDS, that the HIV/AIDS pandemic claimed 3.1 million lives in 2002 and to date has orphaned 14 million children,
	Noting with grave concern that the majority of new HIV infections occur among young people and that women and girls are disproportionately affected by the pandemic,
	Noting that the unequal legal and social status of women heightens their vulnerability to HIV,
	Expressing serious concern about the continued global spread of HIV/AIDS, which exacerbates poverty and poses a major threat to economic and social development and to food security in heavily affected regions, while recognizing that poverty, underdevelopment and illiteracy are among the principal contributing factors to the spread of the disease,
	Noting that the epidemic affects every region and, while sub-Saharan Africa remains worst affected, serious epidemics are present or emerging in the Caribbean, Eastern Europe and Asia and the Pacific,
	Acknowledging that prevention, care, support and treatment for those infected and affected by HIV/AIDS are mutually reinforcing elements of an effective response and must be integrated in a comprehensive approach to combat the epidemic,
	Also acknowledging the importance of maintaining an emphasis on prevention measures in countries with low prevalence rates,
	Recognizing that, while the primary responsibility for responding to HIV/AIDS rests with Governments, the efforts and engagement of all sectors of society are essential to generating an effective response,
	Reaffirming that the full realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is an essential element in a global response to the HIV/AIDS pandemic, and reaffirming also the importance of the elimination of all forms of discrimination against people living with or at risk of HIV/AIDS, including those most vulnerable,
	Recognizing that populations destabilized by armed conflict, humanitarian emergencies and natural disasters, including refugees, internally displaced persons and, in particular, women and children, are at increased risk of exposure to HIV infection,
	Encouraged that civil society, especially organizations representing people living with HIV/AIDS, women, young persons, orphans, faith-based organizations and the private sector, is increasingly involved in national responses to HIV/AIDS, while noting the need for further engagement of these stakeholders at all levels,
	Acknowledging the efforts of international humanitarian organizations, including the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, in combating the epidemic in the most affected areas of the world,
	Noting that strengthened political commitment, including at the highest level, as witnessed, inter alia, at the high-level General Assembly meeting on HIV/AIDS, held on 22 September 2003, demonstrates the resolve of Governments and the international community to intensify implementation and cooperation in order to meet the goals and targets contained in the Declaration of Commitment,
	Noting with appreciation the support for national responses provided by the United Nations system, especially the secretariat of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and Co-sponsors, inter alia, for effective country-led mechanisms, including the mobilization of financial resources, the facilitation and provision of technical assistance and support to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and applicant countries, at every level of the grant-making process,
	Also noting with appreciation the new strategic direction taken by the Joint Programme after the five-year evaluation of the Programme by its Programme Coordinating Board, encompassing, in particular, a greater focus on national-level processes, continued global leadership and advocacy, and a focus on the gender implications of HIV/AIDS,
	Encouraged that the United Nations system has made progress towards integrating the consideration of HIV/AIDS in its activities, including addressing HIV/AIDS in the United Nations workplace, the appointment of HIV/AIDS focal points in peacekeeping operations and the work on guidelines for HIV/AIDS in emergency settings,
	Recognizing the emergence of the World Bank Multi-Country HIV/AIDS Programme and the Global Fund to fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and the contributions of private foundations as important sources of new and additional funding,
	Noting with concern that, although many Member States have met the 2003 targets contained in the Declaration of Commitment, considerable gaps remain,
	Also noting with concern that, at the current rate of implementation and fulfilment of commitments, many countries are unlikely to meet the targets for 2005,
	Recognizing that many developing countries may not have the financial or human resources capacity to mount an effective response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, and in this context underlining the importance of international cooperation,
	Noting that, despite improvement, current global resources available for HIV/AIDS are less than half of the 10 billion United States dollars considered necessary for an effective response in 2005 alone and that substantial new funding will be required in order to meet the global resource targets,
	Also noting that intensified implementation will require partnership and enhanced cooperation at all levels, as well as enhanced support for human and institutional capacity development and considerably increased financial resources,
	Further noting that implementation has to be intensified through partnerships at the national, regional and international levels in order to offer infected and affected people and communities in developing countries and countries with economies in transition medicines and related technology which are affordable, easy to use and readily available,
	Encouraged that an increasing number of companies in the private sector are offering prevention, care and treatment services to employees and their families, while noting the need for continued efforts in this regard,

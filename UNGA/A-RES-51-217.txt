	Recalling also section I of its resolution 48/225, in which it approved (a) the use of the income replacement approach to determine the pensionable remuneration of staff in the General Service and related categories; (b) the application of an interim adjustment procedure similar to that applicable to staff in the Professional and higher categories, namely, on the basis of a 1:1 relationship to increases in the net salaries; and (c) the procedure recommended by the Commission for determining a common staff assessment scale, with two separate sets of rates (single and dependent), for introduction in 1997,

	Recalling further its request to the Commission, in the same resolution, in close cooperation with the Board and as part of the comprehensive review in 1996 of the methodology to determine the pensionable remuneration and consequent pensions of staff in the Professional and higher categories, to develop a common staff assessment scale for the determination of the pensionable remuneration of all categories of staff using the approved procedure and reflecting the latest available tax rates,

	4.	Decides, as regards staff in the General Service and related categories, that:

	(b)	The current interim adjustment procedure should continue to be used in the future;

	6.	Requests the Commission, in full cooperation with the Board, to undertake in 2002 further comprehensive reviews of the methodologies for the determination of the pensionable remuneration of staff in the Professional and higher categories and in the General Service and related categories, and for the adjustment of pensionable remuneration between comprehensive reviews, and to submit recommendations thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-seventh session.

Approves changes in the pension adjustment system, as set out in annex II to the present resolution, (a) to include, without creating a precedent for other situations, with retroactive effect from 1 January 1996, a special measure for determining local currency track pension amounts for beneficiaries residing in countries where a new currency unit has been introduced that significantly strengthens the relationship of the local currency to the United States dollar, subject to the eligibility criteria set out in paragraph 208 of the report of the Board,1 and (b) to provide greater specificity in the criteria set out in paragraph 26 of the pension adjustment system for discontinuing the local currency track pension amounts when they lead to aberrant results in a particular country;

	4.	Takes note of the further review carried out by the International Civil Service Commission and the Board of the provisions of the special index for pensioners, which are used to reduce or eliminate the compensation made for cost-of-living differences in the determination of the initial local currency track pensions under the two-track feature of the pension adjustment system whenever beneficiaries have a tax advantage in an otherwise high-cost country of retirement, and approves the agreed recommendation of the Commission and the Board that the current provisions of the special index for pensioners should be maintained.

	ANNEX II

	Changes in the pension adjustment system


	I.  Payment of the benefit 

1.	In paragraph 26, replace subparagraph (a) with the following:

	"(a)	For countries where the application of the local currency track would lead to aberrant results, with wide fluctuations depending on the precise commencement date of the underlying benefit entitlement, establishment of a local currency base amount in accordance with section C may be discontinued by the Secretary of the Pension Board.  In such cases, the Secretary shall duly inform the Board or the Standing Committee of this action, as soon as feasible;"

2.	In paragraph 26, add a new subparagraph (b) reading:
	
	"(b)Aberrant results in (a) above may be due to, inter alia:

	"(i)A very high inflation rate and an exchange rate which either remained fixed or whose fluctuation was very limited in relation to the level of the inflation rate;

	"(ii)The 36-month average of exchange rates covered different currency units or included a currency unit that was no longer applicable;

	"(iii)Substantial depreciation of the local currency, combined with non-existent, inconsistent or outdated information on the movement of the country's consumer price index."

3.	Renumber paragraph 26 (b) as 26 (c).

4.	Add a new section Q reading:  

	"Q.Special measure for determination of the local currency base amount in certain countries with a new currency unit

"38.	(a)	For countries where a new currency unit was introduced on or after 1 January 1990 which represented, at the time of its introduction, an increase in the value of the local currency in relation to the United States dollar of at least 100 per cent, the local currency base amount under section C, paragraph 5 (b) (iii), above shall be determined in the following manner:

	"(i)For beneficiaries separating before or during the month of introduction of the new currency unit:  by applying to the dollar base amount, as adjusted under section H above to the date of introduction of the new local currency unit, the United Nations operational exchange rate in effect as of such date;

	"(ii)For beneficiaries separating after the end of the month of introduction of the new currency unit:  by applying to the dollar base amount the average of the United Nations operational exchange rates for the new local currency unit over the period from the effective month of introduction of the new currency unit to the month of separation, up to a maximum of 36 months;

	"(b)	This special measure shall apply to all beneficiaries who have provided, or will provide in future, proof of residence in a country which meets the criteria in subparagraph (a) above;

		"(c)	(i)The local currency base amount determined in accordance with subparagraph (a) (i) above shall be adjusted by the consumer price index movement, in accordance with section H above, as from the date of introduction of the new currency unit;


		"(ii)The local currency base amount determined in accordance with subparagraph (a) (ii) above shall be adjusted by the consumer price index movement, in accordance with section H above;

	"(d)  The local currency amount calculated under this special measure will be paid only with effect from the first day of the quarter following submission of proof of residence, or, in cases where proof of residence had been submitted earlier, as from the first day of the quarter following the date of introduction of the new local currency unit, with retroactive effect only as from 1 January 1996;

	"(e)  Should the new local currency unit depreciate against the United States dollar by 50 per cent or more from its value on the date of introduction, beneficiaries covered by the special measure may exercise an option, within two years as from the date of implementation of the special measure, 1 January 1997, to withdraw their proof of residence and to have their pension benefits paid thereafter solely on the United States dollar track.  Such reversion to the dollar track alone would be effective as from the first quarter following receipt of the beneficiary's withdrawal of proof of residence by the Fund secretariat."

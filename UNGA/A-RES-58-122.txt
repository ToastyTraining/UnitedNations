	Welcoming the adoption by the Security Council of resolution 1502 (2003) of 26 August 2003 on the safety and security of humanitarian personnel and United Nations and its associated personnel,
	Taking note of the reports of the Secretary-General on the protection of civilians in armed conflict1 and of Security Council resolutions 1265 (1999) of 17 September 1999 and 1296 (2000) of 19 April 2000 and the recommendations made therein, as well as the statements by the President of the Council of 30 November 1999, on the role of the Council in the prevention of armed conflicts,2 13 January 2000, on humanitarian assistance to refugees in Africa,3 9 February 2000, on protection of United Nations personnel, its associated personnel and humanitarian personnel in conflict zones,4 9 March 2000, on humanitarian aspects of issues before the Council,5 and 15 March 2002, on the aide-memoire for the consideration of issues pertaining to the protection of civilians in armed conflict,6 and noting in that context the range of views expressed during all open debates of the Council on these issues, 
	Reaffirming the need to promote and ensure respect for the principles and rules of international humanitarian law, 
	Concerned by the increasingly difficult context in which humanitarian assistance takes place in some areas, in particular the continuous erosion, in many cases, of respect for the principles and rules of international humanitarian law, 
	Deeply concerned by the dangers and security risks faced by humanitarian personnel and United Nations and its associated personnel at the field level, and mindful of the need to improve the current security management system in order to improve their safety and security,

	Bearing in mind that reaching the vulnerable is essential for providing adequate protection and assistance in the context of natural disasters and complex emergencies as well as for strengthening local capacity to cope with humanitarian needs in such contexts, 
	Welcoming the fact that the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel,10  which entered into force on 15 January 1999, has been ratified or acceded to by sixty-nine States as at the present date, and mindful of the need to promote universality of the Convention, 
	Reaffirming the need to ensure adequate levels of safety and security for United Nations personnel and humanitarian personnel and a culture of accountability at all levels,

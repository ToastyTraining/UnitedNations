	Expressing concern about the adverse impact of the consequences of the world financial and economic crisis, including on development, and evidence of an uneven, fragile and slow recovery, cognizant that the global economy, notwithstanding significant efforts that helped to contain tail risks, improve financial market conditions and stability and sustain recovery, still remains in a challenging phase, with downside risks, including high volatility in global markets, excessive volatility of commodity prices, high unemployment, particularly among young people, unsustainable debt in some countries and widespread fiscal strains, which pose challenges for global economic recovery and reflect the need for additional progress towards sustaining and rebalancing global demand, and stressing the need for continuing efforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances and to reform and strengthen the international financial system while implementing the reforms agreed upon to date,
	Recognizing the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities, especially on women and girls,

	Recognizing the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities on both producer and consumer countries, particularly commodity-dependent developing countries,
	Noting the recent and marked reversal in commodity prices and that commodity net export economies may need to adjust to a possibly protracted period of lower export and fiscal revenues,
	Noting also the volatility and unpredictability of commodity prices, which have threatened, inter alia, the food security of net importers in the recent past, and noting further that the continuation of this long-term uncertainty and volatility, intensified by recent trends in commodity prices, can have an impact on the capacities of many developing countries, particularly commodity-dependent countries, to continue to implement policies for achieving sustainable development and poverty eradication,
	Stressing the importance of policies to address longer-term structural issues, including structural constraints faced by women as economic agents, to diversify commodity economies and to integrate commodity policies into wider development and poverty eradication strategies at all levels,
	Noting all relevant voluntary initiatives aimed at improving transparency in commodity markets and mitigating the impact of excessive price volatility,
	Underlining the importance of timely, accurate and transparent information in helping to address excessive food price volatility, noting global and regional initiatives, including the Agricultural Market Information System and its Rapid Response Forum, the joint organization data initiative and other regional data platforms and programmes, and urging the participating international organizations, private sector actors and Governments to ensure the public dissemination of timely and quality food market information products,

	21.	Stresses that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and its partners, in the spirit of inter-agency cooperation and multi-stakeholder partnerships, within their respective mandates, should continue to engage actively in collaborative research and analysis of the commodity problematique and related capacity- and consensus-building activities, with a view to providing regular analysis and policy advice relevant to the sustainable development of commodity-dependent developing countries, particularly low-income countries;

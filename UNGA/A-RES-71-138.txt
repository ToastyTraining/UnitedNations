Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 13 December 2016
[on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/71/507)] 
71/138.	Technical Notes on Online Dispute Resolution of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966, by which it established the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law with a mandate to further the progressive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade and in that respect to bear in mind the interests of all peoples, in particular those of developing countries, in the extensive development of international trade,
	Recognizing that the sharp increase in online cross-border transactions has raised a need for mechanisms for resolving disputes that arise from such transactions, and recognizing also that one such mechanism is online dispute resolution,
	Observing that online dispute resolution can assist the parties in resolving the dispute in a simple, fast, flexible and secure manner, without the need for physical presence at a meeting or hearing,
	Observing also that online dispute resolution represents significant opportunities for access to dispute resolution by buyers and sellers concluding cross-border commercial transactions, both in developed and developing countries,
	Recalling that, at its forty-third session, in 2010, the Commission agreed that a working group should be established to undertake work in the field of online dispute resolution,1 and that, at its forty-eighth session, in 2015, the Commission decided that the work should take the form of a non-binding descriptive document reflecting elements of an online dispute resolution process,2 
	Noting that the Technical Notes on Online Dispute Resolution3 are non-binding and descriptive and reflect the principles of impartiality, independence, efficiency, effectiveness, due process, fairness, accountability and transparency,
	Noting also that the Technical Notes are expected to contribute significantly to the development of systems to enable the settlement of disputes arising from cross-border low-value sales or service contracts concluded using electronic communications,
	Convinced that the Technical Notes will significantly assist all States, in particular developing countries and States whose economies are in transition, online dispute resolution administrators, online dispute resolution platforms, neutrals and the parties to online dispute resolution proceedings in developing and using online dispute resolution systems,
	Noting with appreciation that all States and interested international organizations were invited to participate in the preparation of the Technical Notes either as members or as observers from the forty-fourth to the forty-ninth sessions of the Commission, including through circulation of the text of the draft Technical Notes for comment to all States as well as to international organizations invited to attend the meetings of the Commission as observers,
	Noting that the preparation of the Technical Notes was the subject
of due deliberation in the Commission and that the draft text benefited from consultations with Governments and interested intergovernmental and international non-governmental organizations,
	1.	Expresses its appreciation to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law for preparing and adopting the Technical Notes on Online Dispute Resolution as annexed to the report of the Commission on the work of its forty-ninth session;4 
	2.	Requests the Secretary-General to publish the text of the Technical Notes through all appropriate means, including electronically, in the six official languages of the United Nations, and to disseminate that text broadly to Governments and other interested bodies;
	3.	Recommends that all States and other stakeholders use the Technical Notes in designing and implementing online dispute resolution systems for cross-border commercial transactions;
	4.	Requests all States to support the promotion and use of the Technical Notes.

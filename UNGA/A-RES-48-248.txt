	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/48/828/Add.1)]


48/248.Financing of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 872 (1993) of
5 October 1993, by which the Council established the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda for a period of six months, until 4 April 1994, subject to the proviso that it would be extended beyond the initial ninety days only upon a review by the Council based on a report from the Secretary-General as to whether or not substantive progress had been made towards the implementation of the Arusha peace agreement,

	Bearing in mind also that, by the same resolution, the Security Council approved the proposal of the Secretary-General that the United Nations Observer Mission Uganda-Rwanda, established by Council resolution 846 (1993) of 22 June 1993, should be integrated within the Assistance Mission,

	Noting that the integration of the Observer Mission within the Assistance Mission is purely administrative in nature and that it will in no way affect the mandate of the Observer Mission as set out in Security Council resolution 846 (1993),

	2/	See A/48/908.

	Recalling its decision 48/479 of 23 December 1993 on the financing of the Assistance Mission,

	Recognizing also that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Assistance Mission, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Assistance Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Reaffirms its resolution 48/227 of 23 December 1993 and stresses the need for the Secretariat to submit budget documents in time in order to allow for a proper and thorough review and approval by the General Assembly of the budgets before their implementation;

	2.	Notes with satisfaction an improvement in the compliance by the Secretariat with certain resolutions of the General Assembly with regard to the form of budget documents concerning peace-keeping operations;

	3.	Reaffirms the importance of the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions as an advisory body to the General Assembly in the budget process;

	4.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee, 2/ subject to the provisions of the present resolution;

	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Assistance Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy, and, in particular, to implement fully the economy, financial and efficiency measures to be approved during the resumed forty-eighth session, but no later than 1 May 1994, and to report on the implementation of such measures in the context of the performance report relevant to the period;

Decides to appropriate to the Special Account referred to in General Assembly decision 48/479 an amount of 45,826,700 United States dollars gross (45,317,600 dollars net), inclusive of the amount of 4.6 million dollars previously authorized by the Advisory Committee, authorized and apportioned in accordance with that decision for the maintenance of the Assistance Mission for the period from 5 October 1993 to 4 April 1994;

	10.	Decides also, with regard to the period beyond 4 April 1994, to authorize the Secretary-General to enter into commitments at a monthly rate not to exceed 9,082,600 dollars gross for the period from 5 April to 31 October 1994, in connection with the maintenance of the Assistance Mission, subject to the decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the Assistance Mission beyond 4 April 1994, the said amount to be apportioned among Member States in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991 and 47/218 A of
23 December 1992 and its decision 48/472 A of 23 December 1993, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the years 1992, 1993 and 1994 as set out in Assembly resolutions 46/221 A of 20 December 1991 and 48/223 A of
23 December 1993, and Assembly decision 47/456 of 23 December 1992;

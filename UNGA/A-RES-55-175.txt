	Welcoming the inclusion of attacks intentionally directed against personnel involved in a humanitarian assistance or peacekeeping mission in accordance with the Charter as a war crime in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, adopted on 17 July 1998,11 and noting the role that the Court could play in bringing to justice those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law,
	Noting that the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, which entered into force on 15 January 1999,12 has been ratified by 46 Member States as at the present date,
	Reaffirming the fundamental requirement that appropriate modalities for the safety and security of humanitarian and United Nations and its associated personnel be incorporated into all new and ongoing United Nations field operations,

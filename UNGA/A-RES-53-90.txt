53/90.Implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolutions 46/151 of 18 December 1991, the annex to which contains the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s,

	Recalling also its resolutions 48/214 of 23 December 1993 and 49/142 of 23 December 1994 on the New Agenda, as well as its resolution 51/32 of 6 December 1996 on the mid-term review of the implementation of the New Agenda,

	Mindful of the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee for Programme and Coordination at its thirty-seventh1 and the first part of its thirty-eighth2 sessions relating to its consideration of the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative for the Implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, launched by the Secretary-General on 15 March 1996,

	Recognizing that, despite some improvements in economic performance in several countries in Africa, the continent continues to face critical social and economic problems,


	Noting with concern that, while challenges and opportunities are created by the process of globalization, Africa continues to be marginalized in the world economy, and is experiencing a decline in net resource flows and in its share of world trade,

	Having considered the progress report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, including measures and recommendations agreed upon at its mid-term review,3

	Noting with appreciation the adoption, by the Second Tokyo International Conference on African Development, held at Tokyo from 19 to 21 October 1998, of the Tokyo Agenda for Action,4 which, among other things, emphasizes the principles of accelerated economic growth for poverty reduction and further integration of the continent into the global economy as well as highlights the concepts of ownership and global partnership,

	1.	Takes note with appreciation of the progress report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, including measures and recommendations agreed upon at its mid-term review;3

	2.	Expresses concern at the overall declining trend of resource flows to Africa, in particular in the level of official development assistance, which has been an impediment, among other things, to the timely implementation of the New Agenda;

	3.	Emphasizes the need to focus on priority areas identified by African countries themselves, as stipulated in the Cairo Agenda for Action5 and the New Agenda, and to organize close consultations at both the policy and the operational levels among the various development partners, in order to achieve the best results;

	4.	Reiterates the importance of effective monitoring and evaluation mechanisms and other follow-up mechanisms for the implementation of the New Agenda at the national, subregional, regional and global levels, and in this regard requests the Secretary-General to propose a set of performance indicators to measure the progress made in the implementation of the New Agenda;

	5.	Urges all States, international and multilateral organizations, financial institutions and development funds and programmes of the United Nations system as well as intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to take, as a matter of urgency, concrete and effective measures in order to implement fully, in a coordinated manner, the recommendations contained in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly for the Mid-term Review of the Implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s;6


	6.	Requests the Secretary-General, in his efforts to harmonize current international and bilateral initiatives on Africa, to ensure the effective and timely implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, and, in this context, to ensure that the United Nations and its funds and programmes are working in a coordinated manner within the framework of the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative for the Implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s;

	7.	Also requests the Secretary-General, pending the final review and appraisal of the New Agenda in the year 2002, to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a progress report on the implementation of resolution 51/32.

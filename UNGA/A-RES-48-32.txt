		48/32.Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its twenty-sixth session


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966, by which it created the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law with a mandate to further the progressive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade and in that respect to bear in mind the interests of all peoples, in particular those of developing countries, in the extensive development of international trade,

	Reaffirming its conviction that the progressive harmonization and unification of international trade law, in reducing or removing legal obstacles to the flow of international trade, especially those affecting the developing countries, would significantly contribute to universal economic cooperation among all States on a basis of equality, equity and common interest and to the elimination of discrimination in international trade and, thereby, to the well-being of all peoples,

	Stressing the value of participation by States at all levels of economic development and from different legal systems in the process of harmonizing and unifying international trade law,

	Having considered the report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its twenty-sixth session, 1/

	Having considered also the report of the Secretary-General, 2/

session; 1/

	3.	Reaffirms the mandate of the Commission, as the core legal body within the United Nations system in the field of international trade law, to coordinate legal activities in this field in order to avoid duplication of effort and to promote efficiency, consistency and coherence in the unification and harmonization of international trade law and, in this connection, recommends that the Commission, through its secretariat, continue to maintain close cooperation with the other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, including regional organizations, active in the field of international trade law;

	4.	Also reaffirms the importance, in particular for developing countries, of the work of the Commission concerned with training and assistance in the field of international trade law and the desirability for it to sponsor seminars and symposia to provide such training and assistance, and, in this connection:

	(a)	Expresses its appreciation to the Commission for organizing seminars at Bangkok; Jakarta; Lahore, Pakistan; Colombo; Dhaka; Kiev; Warsaw; and Rogaska Slatina, Slovenia, and for assisting the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council with its initiative to promote harmonization of international trade law in the Asia-Pacific region, and to the Governments whose contributions enabled the seminars to take place;

Decides, in order to ensure full participation by all Member States in the sessions of the Commission and its working groups, to continue its consideration in the competent Main Committee during the forty-eighth session of the General Assembly on granting travel assistance, within existing resources, to the least developed countries that are members of the Commission, at their request and in consultation with the Secretary-General;

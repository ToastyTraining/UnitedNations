51/243.Gratis personnel provided by Governments and other entities

	The General Assembly,

	Taking note of the reports of the Secretary-General on gratis personnel provided by Governments and other entities1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

	Expressing serious concern at the impact on the geographical balance in some parts of the Secretariat of the presence of gratis personnel, in particular in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations,

	Recognizing that the use of gratis personnel, other than those performing supplementary activities, should be on an exceptional and temporary basis and for specialized functions only,

	1.	Emphasizes that gratis personnel are not a substitute for staff to be recruited against authorized posts for the implementation of mandated programmes and activities;

	2.	Reaffirms that the programme of work and mandates approved by Member States must be financed in the manner determined by the General Assembly, based upon proposals of the Secretary-General;

	3.	Decides that gratis personnel should not be sought for financial reasons;


	4.	Decides also that the Secretary-General can accept type II gratis personnel3 only in the following circumstances:

	(a)	After the approval of a budget, to provide expertise not available within the Organization for very specialized functions, as identified by the Secretary-General, and for a limited and specified period of time;

	(b)	To provide temporary and urgent assistance in the case of new and/or expanded mandates of the Organization, pending a decision by the General Assembly on the level of resources required to implement those mandates;

	5.	Decides further, in this regard, that the relevant budget resolutions and procedures relating to unforeseen and extraordinary expenditures, peacekeeping operations and tribunals will govern the acceptance of the gratis personnel referred to in paragraph 4 above;

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to report on a quarterly basis to the General Assembly, through the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, for appropriate action, on the acceptance of the gratis personnel referred to in paragraph 4 above, with a view to ensuring compliance with the provisions of the present resolution;

	7.	Emphasizes that the relevant General Assembly resolutions and financial regulations and rules should be fully respected when accepting gratis personnel in accordance with the provisions of the present resolution;

	8.	Emphasizes also that it is necessary that fully substantiated and comprehensive proposals on the total requirements from all sources of funding be presented so as to enable the General Assembly to decide on the level of resources required to implement fully all mandated programmes and activities, and requests the Secretary-General to present all future budgets and budget outlines in that manner, in accordance with Assembly resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986;

	9.	Requests the Secretary-General to phase out expeditiously type II gratis personnel who fall outside the scope of paragraph 4 above and to report thereon to the General Assembly at the main part of its fifty-second regular session;

	10.	Also requests the Secretary-General to report to it at the main part of its fifty-second regular session, through the Advisory Committee, for appropriate action, on the methodology to be applied to, and the level of, administrative support costs and, in the interim, to maintain the status quo in this regard;

	11.	Further requests the Secretary-General to revise the draft guidelines set out in his reports on gratis personnel in accordance with the provisions of the present resolution and taking into account the following principles, and to submit them to the General Assembly, through the Advisory Committee, for its approval at the main part of its fifty-second regular session:

	(a)	Gratis personnel should be subject to the criteria laid down in Article 100 and in paragraphs 1 and 3 of Article 101 of the Charter of the United Nations;

	(c)	Gratis personnel should carry out their functions in accordance with all applicable regulations, rules and procedures of the Organization;

	(d)	The selection process for gratis personnel should be transparent and conducted on as wide a geographical basis as possible, and, if there is a need for gratis personnel as provided for in the present resolution, all Member States should be informed;

	12.	Requests the Secretary-General to report annually on the use of gratis personnel, indicating, inter alia, their nationality, the duration of their service and the functions performed;

	13.	Also requests the Secretary-General, in the context of the consideration by the General Assembly of the question of gratis personnel provided by Governments and other entities, to report on the impact of the implementation of paragraphs 4 (b) and 9 above and to submit proposals in this regard to the Assembly at the main part of its fifty-second regular session, through the Advisory Committee, for appropriate action;

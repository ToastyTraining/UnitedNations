	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/54/830)]


54/260.	Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

    Bearing in mind Security Council resolutions 1258 (1999) of 6 August 1999 and 1279 (1999) of 30 November 1999 regarding,  respectively, the deployment to the Congo region of military liaison personnel and the establishment of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Security Council resolution 1291 (2000) of 24 February 2000, by which the Council extended the mandate of the Mission until 31 August 2000,

    Recognizing that the costs of the Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

    Recognizing also that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,


    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Trust Fund to Support the Peace Process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

    1.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursements to troop contributors that bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

    2.	Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in full and on time;

    3.	Expresses concern at the delay experienced by the Secretary-General in deploying and providing adequate resources to some recent peacekeeping missions, in particular those in Africa;

    4.	Emphasizes that all existing and future peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements;

    5.	Also emphasizes that all peacekeeping missions shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates;

    6.	Requests the Secretary-General to make the fullest possible use of facilities and equipment at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, in order to minimize the costs of procurement for the Mission, and for this purpose requests the Secretary-General to speed up the implementation of the asset management system at all peacekeeping missions in accordance with General Assembly  resolution 52/1 of 15 October 1997;

    7.	Endorses the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2 and requests the Secretary-General to ensure their full implementation;

    8.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

    9.	Also requests the Secretary-General, in order to reduce the cost of employing General Service staff, to employ locally recruited staff for the Mission against General Service posts, commensurate with the requirements of the Mission;


    10.	Authorizes the Secretary-General to enter into commitments for the Mission for the period from 6 August 1999 to 30 June 2000 in an amount not exceeding 200 million United States dollars gross (199,760,000 dollars net), inclusive of the amount of 41,011,200 dollars gross (40,771,200 dollars net) previously authorized by the Advisory Committee, and requests the Secretary-General to establish a special account for the Mission;

    11.	Decides, as an ad hoc arrangement, to apportion the amount of 200 million dollars gross (199,760,000 dollars net) among Member States in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996, 51/218 A to C of 18 December 1996 and 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993, 50/451 B of 23 December 1995 and 54/456 to 54/458 of 23 December 1999, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the years 1999 and 2000, as set out in its resolutions 52/215 A of 22 December 1997 and 54/237 A of 23 December 1999;

    12.	Decides also that, in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955, there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 11 above, their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated staff assessment income of 240,000 dollars approved for the Mission for the period from 6 August 1999 to 30 June 2000;

    13.	Emphasizes that no peacekeeping mission shall be financed by borrowing funds from other active peacekeeping missions;

    14.	Encourages the Secretary-General to continue to take additional measures to ensure the safety and security of all personnel under the auspices of the United Nations participating in the Mission;

    15.	Invites voluntary contributions to the Mission in cash and in the form of services and supplies acceptable to the Secretary-General, to be administered, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedure and practices established by the General Assembly;

    16.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly, in September 2000, a comprehensive report on the financing of the Mission, including full budget estimates and information on the utilization of resources until the time of the submission of the report, to enable the Assembly to take action on it at the main part of its fifty-fifth session;

    17.	Notes the intention of the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly, during the second part of its resumed fifty-fourth session, a preliminary expenditure report for the Mission for the period from 6 August 1999 to 30 June 2000;

    18.	Decides to keep under review during its fifty-fourth session the item entitled "Financing of the United Nations Organization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo".

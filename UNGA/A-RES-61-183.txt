[on the report of the Third Committee (A/61/445)]
61/183.	International cooperation against the world drug problem


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 the provisions of the 2005 World Summit Outcome2 addressing the world drug problem, its resolution 60/178 of 16 December 2005 and its other previous resolutions,
	Reaffirming the Political Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its twentieth special session3 and the importance of meeting the objectives targeted for 2008,
	Reaffirming also the joint ministerial statement adopted at the ministerial segment of the forty-sixth session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs,4 the Action Plan5 for the Implementation of the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction6 and the Action Plan on International Cooperation on the Eradication of Illicit Drug Crops and on Alternative Development,7
	Gravely concerned that, despite continued increased efforts by States, relevant organizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, the drug problem continues to constitute a serious threat to public health and safety and the well-being of humanity, in particular children and young people, and to the national security and sovereignty of States, and that it undermines socio-economic and political stability and sustainable development,
	Concerned by the serious challenges and threats posed by the continuing links between illicit drug trafficking and terrorism and other national and transnational criminal activities and transnational criminal networks, inter alia, trafficking in human beings, especially women and children, money-laundering, financing of terrorism, corruption, trafficking in arms and trafficking in chemical precursors, and reaffirming that strong and effective international cooperation is needed to counter these threats,
	Bearing in mind that the ten-year assessment of the implementation by Member States of the goals and targets of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly is scheduled for 2008, and looking forward to its outcome,
	Taking note with concern of the report of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime entitled "Afghanistan Opium Survey 2006", which emphasized that the cultivation and production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs had significantly increased and threatened the security and stability of that country and had negative regional and international implications, taking note of Economic and Social Council resolution 2006/32 of 27 July 2006 entitled "Support for the National Drug Control Strategy of the Government of Afghanistan", welcoming the ongoing efforts of Afghanistan in the fight against narcotics, and calling upon the Government of Afghanistan and the international community to intensify those efforts within the framework of the Afghanistan Compact,8
	Recognizing that international cooperation in countering drug abuse and illicit production and trafficking has shown that positive results can be achieved through sustained and collective efforts, and expressing its appreciation for the initiatives in this regard,
	Bearing in mind the important role that civil society, including non-governmental organizations, plays in combating the drug problem,
	Taking note of the thematic debate on alternative development as an important drug control strategy and establishing alternative development as a cross-cutting issue, held by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs at its forty-ninth session,9
	1.	Reaffirms that countering the world drug problem is a common and shared responsibility that must be addressed in a multilateral setting, requires an integrated and balanced approach and must be carried out in full conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and other provisions of international law, and in particular with full respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States, the principle of non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and all human rights and fundamental freedoms, and on the basis of the principles of equal rights and mutual respect;
	2.	Also reaffirms that there shall be a balanced approach between demand reduction and supply reduction, each reinforcing the other, in an integrated approach to solving the drug problem;
	3.	Urges States that have not done so to consider ratifying or acceding to, and States parties to implement all the provisions of, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 as amended by the 1972 Protocol,10 the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 197111 and the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988;12
	4.	Invites all States, as a matter of priority, to consider signing, ratifying or acceding to, and States parties to fully implement, the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto13 and the United Nations Convention against Corruption,14 in order to counter comprehensively the transnational criminal activities that are related to illicit drug trafficking;
	5.	Urges all States to promote and implement the outcome of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly, as well as the outcome of the ministerial segment of the forty-sixth session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, to implement the Action Plan5 for the Implementation of the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction6 and to strengthen their national efforts to counter the abuse of illicit drugs in their population;
	6.	Calls upon States and other relevant actors to evaluate progress made since 1998 towards meeting, in their respective areas of concern, the goals and targets set at the twentieth special session of the General Assembly;

	17.	Calls upon Member States and national and international development organizations to increase their efforts to empower local communities and authorities in project areas and to enhance their participation in the decision-making process in order to increase their ownership of the development measures taken in accordance with national legislation and the sustainability of those measures and to create a law-abiding and prosperous rural society;

	19.	Urges all States and relevant international organizations to cooperate closely with the International Narcotics Control Board, in particular in Project Cohesion and Project Prism, in order to enhance the success of those international initiatives and to initiate, where appropriate, investigations by their law enforcement authorities into seizures and cases involving the diversion or smuggling of precursors and essential equipment, with a view to tracking them back to the source of diversion in order to prevent continuing illicit activity;

	22.	Stresses that international cooperation on domestic precursor policies and practices would assist in complementing existing law enforcement cooperative initiatives, and encourages States to cooperate at the regional level on measures to prevent and control the domestic diversion of precursors, drawing on best practices and sharing experiences;

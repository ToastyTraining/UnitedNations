Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 21 December 2010
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/65/456/Add.2 (Part II))]
65/206.	Moratorium on the use of the death penalty


	The General Assembly,
	Guided by the purposes and principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations, 
	Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights2 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child,3 
	Reaffirming its resolutions 62/149 of 18 December 2007 and 63/168 of 18 December 2008 on the question of a moratorium on the use of the death penalty, in which the General Assembly called upon States that still maintain the death penalty to establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing it, 
	Mindful that any miscarriage or failure of justice in the implementation of the death penalty is irreversible and irreparable, 
	Convinced that a moratorium on the use of the death penalty contributes to respect for human dignity and to the enhancement and progressive development of human rights, and considering that there is no conclusive evidence of the deterrent value of the death penalty,
	Noting ongoing national debates and regional initiatives on the death penalty, as well as the readiness of an increasing number of Member States to make available information on the use of the death penalty, 
	Noting also the technical cooperation among Member States in relation to moratoriums on the death penalty, 
	1.	Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of resolution 63/1684 and the recommendations contained therein;
	2.	Also welcomes the steps taken by some countries to reduce the number of offences for which the death penalty may be imposed and the decisions made by an increasing number of States to apply a moratorium on executions, followed in many cases by the abolition of the death penalty;
	3.	Calls upon all States:
	(a)	To respect international standards that provide safeguards guaranteeing protection of the rights of those facing the death penalty, in particular the minimum standards, as set out in the annex to Economic and Social Council resolution 1984/50 of 25 May 1984, as well as to provide the Secretary-General with information in this regard; 
	(b)	To make available relevant information with regard to their use of the death penalty, which can contribute to possible informed and transparent national debates; 
	(c)	To progressively restrict the use of the death penalty and to reduce the number of offences for which it may be imposed;
	(d)	To establish a moratorium on executions with a view to abolishing the death penalty; 
	4.	Calls upon States which have abolished the death penalty not to reintroduce it, and encourages them to share their experience in this regard; 
	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session on the implementation of the present resolution; 
	6.	Decides to continue its consideration of the matter at its sixty-seventh session under the item entitled "Promotion and protection of human rights".

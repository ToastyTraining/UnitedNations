[on the report of the Third Committee (A/65/456/Add.1)]
65/204.	Committee against Torture


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,1
	Welcoming the work of the Committee against Torture,
	Regretting the persistent backlog of reports of States parties and individual communications awaiting consideration, which prevents the Committee from considering reports and communications in a timely manner and without undue delay,
	Noting the request of the Committee that the General Assembly authorize an extension of its meeting time,
	Noting also that the Committee has only ten members and currently only meets for two sessions of three weeks a year,
	Noting further that the estimated budgetary requirements of the requested extension of meeting time will be met within the programme budget approved for the biennium 2010-2011 and will be further dealt with in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013, while bearing in mind the need to make the best possible use of resources,
	Taking note of the note by the Secretary-General on the evaluation of the use of additional meeting time by the human rights treaty bodies,2 the increasing workload of the treaty bodies and the increasing number of requests from them for more meeting time,
	1.	Expresses its appreciation for the efforts made so far by the Committee against Torture to improve the efficiency of its working methods, including with a view to further harmonizing the working methods of the treaty bodies, and encourages the Committee to continue its activities in this regard;
	2.	Decides to authorize the Committee to meet for an additional week per session as a temporary measure, with effect from May 2011 until the end of November 2012, in order to address the backlog of reports of States parties and individual complaints awaiting consideration;
	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session concrete and tailored proposals on the human rights treaty bodies, including the Committee against Torture, building on the work of the Secretary-General pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution 9/8 of 24 September 20083 and of the treaty bodies in this regard, to improve their effectiveness and to identify efficiencies in their working methods and resource requirements in order to better manage their workloads, bearing in mind budgetary constraints and taking account of the varying burdens on each treaty body.

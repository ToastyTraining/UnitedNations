	The General Assembly,

	Recalling also the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development1 and the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development,2

	Recalling General Assembly resolution 63/199 of 19 December 2008 on social justice for a fair globalization, in which the Assembly took note with interest of the adoption of the Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization,3 
	Recalling also the 2005 World Summit Outcome4 and all relevant General Assembly resolutions, in particular those that have built upon the 2005 World Summit Outcome, in the economic, social and related fields, including Assembly resolution 60/265 of 30 June 2006 entitled "Follow-up to the development outcome of the 2005 World Summit, including the Millennium Development Goals and the other internationally agreed development goals", 
	Reaffirming that the United Nations has a central role in promoting international cooperation for development and in promoting policy coherence on global development issues, including in the context of globalization and interdependence,
	Reaffirming also the resolve expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration5 to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all, 
	Recognizing that globalization, driven largely by economic liberalization and technology, implies that the economic performance of a country is increasingly affected by factors outside its geographical borders and that maximizing in an equitable manner the benefits of globalization requires developing responses to globalization through a strengthened global partnership for development to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, 
	Reaffirming its strong support for fair and inclusive globalization and the need to translate growth into poverty reduction and in this regard its resolve to make the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all, including for women and young people, a central objective of relevant national and international policies as well as national development strategies, including poverty reduction strategies, as part of efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, 
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;6 
	2.	Recognizes that some countries have successfully adapted to the changes and have benefited from globalization but that many others, especially the least developed countries, have remained marginalized in the globalizing world economy, and recognizes also that, as stated in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,6 the benefits are very unevenly shared, while the costs are unevenly distributed;
	3.	Reaffirms the need for the United Nations to play a fundamental role in the promotion of international cooperation for development and the coherence, coordination and implementation of development goals and actions agreed upon by the international community, and resolves to strengthen coordination within the United Nations system in close cooperation with all other multilateral financial, trade and development institutions in order to support sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and sustainable development;
	4.	Welcomes the joint crisis initiative launched by the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination in 2009 to provide coordination on social protection floors, which aims at advocating for and advising on the provision of social protection floors and public spending in ways that will both kick-start growth and support more inclusive and sustainable social and economic development; 
	5.	Recognizes that policies which link economic and social development can contribute to reducing inequalities within and among countries with a view to guaranteeing that the poor and vulnerable groups maximize their benefits from economic growth and development; 
	6.	Notes with concern the unprecedented rise in unemployment as a consequence of the current global financial and economic crisis, recognizes that decent work remains one of the best routes out of poverty, and in this regard invites donor countries, multilateral organizations and other development partners to consider assisting developing countries to implement the resolution entitled "Recovering from the crisis: a Global Jobs Pact" adopted by the International Labour Conference at its ninety-eighth session, in consultation and cooperation with the International Labour Organization; 
	7.	Stresses the need for all countries to harness knowledge and technology and stimulate innovation if they are to improve their competitiveness and benefit from trade and investment, and in this regard underlines the importance of concrete actions to facilitate the transfer of technology under fair, transparent and mutually agreed terms to developing countries in support of the implementation of their sustainable development strategies;
	8.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-fifth session, under the item entitled "Globalization and interdependence" the sub-item entitled "Role of the United Nations in promoting development in the context of globalization and interdependence".

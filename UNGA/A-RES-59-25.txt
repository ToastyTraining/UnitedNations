		59/25.	Sustainable fisheries, including through the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, and related instruments 


	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming its resolutions 46/215 of 20 December 1991, 49/116 and 49/118 of 19 December 1994, 50/25 of 5 December 1995 and 57/142 of 12 December 2002, as well as other resolutions on large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing, unauthorized fishing in zones of national jurisdiction and on the high seas, fisheries by-catch and discards, and other developments, its resolutions 56/13 of 28 November 2001 and 57/143 of 12 December 2002 on the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks ("the Agreement"),1 and its resolution 58/14 of 24 November 2003, 
	Recalling the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ("the Convention"),2 and bearing in mind the relationship between the Convention and the Agreement, 
	Recognizing that, in accordance with the Convention, the Agreement sets forth provisions concerning the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, including provisions on subregional and regional cooperation in enforcement, binding dispute settlement and the rights and obligations of States in authorizing the use of vessels flying their flags for fishing on the high seas, and specific provisions to address the requirements of developing States in relation to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and the development of fisheries for such stocks, 
	Noting that the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ("the Code")3 and its associated international plans of action set out principles and global standards of behaviour for responsible practices for the conservation of fisheries resources and the management and development of fisheries, 
	Noting with concern that effective management of marine capture fisheries has been made difficult in some areas by unreliable information and data caused by unreported and misreported fish catch and fishing effort and the contribution this lack of data makes to continued overfishing in some areas, 
	Noting with satisfaction the Strategy for Improving Information on Status and Trends of Capture Fisheries recently adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,4 and recognizing that the long-term improvement of the knowledge and understanding of fishery status and trends is a fundamental basis for fisheries policy and management for implementing the Code,
	Recognizing the need to implement, as a matter of priority, the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development ("Johannesburg Plan of Implementation"),5 in relation to achieving sustainable fisheries,
	Deploring the fact that fish stocks, including straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, in many parts of the world are overfished or subject to sparsely regulated and heavy fishing efforts, mainly as a result of, inter alia, unauthorized fishing, inadequate regulatory measures, harmful fisheries subsidies and excess fishing capacity, 
	Concerned that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing threatens seriously to deplete populations of certain fish species and to significantly damage marine ecosystems, to the detriment of sustainable fisheries as well as the food security and the economies of many States, particularly developing States,
	Noting with satisfaction resolution 6/2003 of 9 December 2003, adopted by the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, relating to preventing, deterring and eliminating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing,6
	Recognizing that the problem of overfishing continues to be exacerbated by inadequate flag State control over fishing vessels, including those fishing for straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, and insufficient monitoring, control and surveillance measures,
	Recognizing also that the interrelationship between ocean activities, such as shipping and fishing, and environmental issues needs further consideration,
	Noting that the contribution of aquaculture to global fish supplies continues to increase its potential in developing countries to enhance local food security and poverty alleviation and meet future demands in fish consumption, bearing in mind article 9.1.4 of the Code, 
	Calling attention to the circumstances affecting fisheries in many developing States, in particular African States and small island developing States, and recognizing the urgent need for capacity-building to assist such States in meeting their obligations under international instruments and realizing the benefits from fisheries resources,
	Noting the obligation of all States, pursuant to the provisions of the Convention, to cooperate in the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, and recognizing the importance of coordination and cooperation at the global, regional, subregional as well as national levels in the areas, inter alia, of data collection, information-sharing, capacity-building and training for the conservation, management and sustainable development of marine living resources, 
	Recognizing the duty provided in the Convention, the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas ("the Compliance Agreement"),7 the Agreement and the Code for flag States to exercise effective control over fishing vessels flying their flag and vessels flying their flag which provide support to such vessels, and to ensure that the activities of such vessels do not undermine the effectiveness of conservation and management measures taken in accordance with international law and adopted at the national, subregional, regional or global levels, 
	Recognizing also the urgent need for action at all levels to ensure the long-term sustainable use and management of fisheries resources through the wide application of a precautionary approach and appropriate measures to reduce pollution and waste, and other factors, such as discards and catch by lost or abandoned gear, which adversely affect fish stocks,
	Recognizing further the economic and cultural importance of sharks in many countries, the biological importance of sharks in the marine ecosystem, the vulnerability of some shark species to over-exploitation, the need for measures to promote the long-term sustainability of shark populations and fisheries and the relevance of the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 1999, in providing development guidance of such measures, 
	Reaffirming its support for the initiative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and relevant regional and subregional fisheries management organizations and arrangements on the conservation and management of sharks, while noting with concern that only a small number of countries have implemented the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks,
	Noting with satisfaction the outcomes of the third round of informal consultations of States parties to the Agreement, held in New York on 8 July 2004,
	Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General,8 including the section outlining current risks to the marine biodiversity of vulnerable marine ecosystems related to fishing activities, and conservation and management measures in place at the global, regional, subregional or national levels addressing these issues, in particular the useful role of the report in gathering and disseminating information on or relating to the sustainable development of the world's marine living resources,
	Expressing concern that the practice of large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing remains a threat to marine living resources, although the incidence of this practice has continued to be low in most regions of the world's oceans and seas, 
	Emphasizing that efforts should be made to ensure that the implementation of resolution 46/215 in some parts of the world does not result in the transfer to other parts of the world of drift nets that contravene the resolution, 
	Expressing concern, while recognizing considerable efforts to reduce by-catch in longline fishing through various regional fisheries management organizations, at the reports of continued loss of seabirds, particularly albatrosses, as a result of incidental mortality from longline fishing operations, and the loss of other marine species, including sharks, fin-fish species and marine turtles, as a result of incidental mortality,
	Welcoming the fact that a growing number of States, and entities referred to in the Convention and in article 1, paragraph 2 (b), of the Agreement, as well as regional and subregional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, have taken measures, as appropriate, towards the implementation of the provisions of the Agreement, 
	Recognizing the significant contribution of sustainable fisheries to food security, income and wealth for present and future generations,

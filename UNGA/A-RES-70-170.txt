	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,1 which it adopted on 13 December 2006 and which entered into force on 3 May 2008, a landmark convention affirming the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons with disabilities, and recognizing that it is both a human rights and a development instrument,
	Recalling its resolution 67/160 of 20 December 2012, in which it requested the Secretary-General to take further actions to promote the rights of persons with disabilities in the United Nations system in accordance with the Convention, including the retention and recruitment of persons with disabilities,
	Recalling also its previous relevant resolutions, in which it requested the Secretary-General to continue to improve full inclusion of persons with disabilities and continue the progressive implementation of standards and guidelines with respect to the accessibility of facilities and services of the United Nations system, taking into account the relevant provisions of the Convention,
	Noting with appreciation the efforts of the Secretary-General in this regard, including the opening of the accessibility centres at the United Nations offices in New York and Bangkok,
	Noting that improvement in accessibility has been a core goal of the capital master plan since the commencement of the renovation of United Nations Headquarters, and recalling its resolution 69/250 of 29 December 2014, in which it requested the Secretary-General to continue to address issues related to the accessibility of conference facilities as a matter of priority and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its seventieth session,

	1.

Requests the Secretary-General to continue to raise awareness about protecting and promoting the rights of persons with disabilities and to improve relevant regulations, facilities and services within the United Nations system, including its agencies, funds and programmes, and regional offices to create non-discriminatory and accessible environments for persons with disabilities, including staff members, delegates and visitors with disabilities, bearing in mind the full range of disabilities as defined in article 1 of the Convention, and encourages Member States to support the Secretary-General in this regard;
	3.	Also requests the Secretary-General to further promote awareness and understanding among United Nations staff members towards persons with disabilities, including recognition of their full potential and their contribution to the work of the United Nations;
	4.	Further requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its seventy-first session a comprehensive report, to be prepared from within existing resources, on:
	(a)	The status and application of existing regulations relating to reasonable accommodation and the status of facilities and services relating thereto and areas that need improvement to ensure full accessibility, following universal design, and reasonable accommodation within the United Nations system, including its agencies, funds and programmes, and regional offices;
	(b)	Best practices and views of Member States, other international organizations and other relevant stakeholders, including the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the rights of persons with disabilities, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, disabled persons' organizations and United Nations staff members with disabilities, on the provision of accessibility, following universal design, and reasonable accommodation;

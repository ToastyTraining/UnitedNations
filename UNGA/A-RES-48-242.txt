	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/48/815/Add.2)]


48/242.Financing of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolutions 687 (1991) of 3 April 1991 and 689 (1991) of 9 April 1991, by which the Council decided to set up the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission and to review the question of its termination or continuation every six months,

	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Observation Mission, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Recalling also its resolution 45/260 of 3 May 1991 on the financing of the Observation Mission and its subsequent resolutions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 47/208 B of 14 September 1993, as well as its decision 48/466 A of 23 December 1993,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Observation Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,
__________

	1/	A/48/844 and Corr.1.

	2/	A/48/897.

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Expressing its appreciation for the substantial voluntary contributions made to the Observation Mission by the Government of Kuwait and the contributions of other Governments,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Observation Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

		Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission as at 24 March 1994, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 23,719,106 United States dollars;

		Expresses concern about the deteriorating financial situation with regard to peace-keeping activities due to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments, particularly Member States in arrears;

		Expresses deep concern about the adverse effect that the deteriorating financial situation has on reimbursement to troop contributors, placing an additional burden on these countries and putting at risk the continuing supply of troops to the Observation Mission and, consequently, the effective implementation of its mandate; 

		Expresses its appreciation for the decision of the Government of Kuwait to defray two thirds of the cost of the Observation Mission, effective 1 November 1993;

		Reaffirms its resolution 48/227 of 23 December 1993 and stresses the need for the Secretariat to submit budget documents in time in order to allow for a proper and thorough review and approval by the General Assembly of the budgets before their implementation;

		Notes with satisfaction an improvement in the compliance by the Secretariat with certain resolutions of the General Assembly with regard to the form of budget documents concerning peace-keeping operations;

		Reaffirms the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions as an advisory body to the General Assembly in the budget process;

		Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee, 2/ subject to the provisions of the present resolution; 

		Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Observation Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy and, in particular, to implement fully economy, financial and efficiency measures to be approved during the resumed forty-eighth session but no later than 1 May 1994, and to report on the implementation of such measures in the context of the performance report relevant to that period;

		Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Observation Mission in full;

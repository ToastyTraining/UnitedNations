	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 58/127 of 19 December 2003 and all its previous resolutions on assistance in mine clearance and mine action, all adopted without a vote,
	Recalling all relevant treaties and conventions1 and their review processes,
	Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian and development problems caused by the presence of mines and explosive remnants of war2 that have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of countries affected by mines and explosive remnants of war,
	Bearing in mind the serious threat that mines and explosive remnants of war pose to the safety, health and lives of local civilian populations, as well as of personnel participating in humanitarian, peacekeeping and rehabilitation programmes and operations,
	Deeply alarmed by the number of mines that continue to be laid each year, as well as the presence of a decreasing but still very large number of, and area of square kilometres infested by, mines and explosive remnants of war as a result of armed conflicts, and therefore remaining convinced of the necessity and urgency of strengthening mine-action efforts by the international community with a view to eliminating the threat of landmines and explosive remnants of war to civilians as soon as possible,
	Recognizing that, in addition to the primary role of States, the United Nations has a significant role to play in the field of assistance in mine action, and considering mine action to be an important and integrated component of United Nations humanitarian and development activities, as well as noting the inclusion of mine action in several United Nations peacekeeping operations,
	Stressing the need to convince mine-affected States to halt new deployments of anti-personnel mines in order to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency of mine-clearance operations,
	Stressing also the pressing need to urge non-State actors to halt immediately and unconditionally new deployments of mines and other associated explosive devices,
	1.	Calls, in particular, for the continuation of the efforts of States, with the assistance of the United Nations and relevant organizations involved in mine action, as appropriate, to foster the establishment and development of national mine-action capacities in countries in which mines and explosive remnants of war constitute a serious threat to the safety, health and lives of the local civilian population or an impediment to social and economic development efforts at the national and local levels;
	2.	Urges all States, in particular those that have the capacity to do so, as well as the United Nations system and relevant organizations and institutions involved in mine action, as appropriate, to provide:
	(a)	Assistance to countries affected by mines and explosive remnants of war for the establishment and development of national mine-action capacities;
	(b)	Support for national programmes, where appropriate, in cooperation with the relevant bodies of the United Nations system and relevant regional, governmental and non-governmental organizations, to reduce the risks posed by landmines and explosive remnants of war, including to women and children;
	(c)	Reliable, predictable and timely contributions for mine-action activities, including through national mine-action efforts and humanitarian mine-action programmes of non-governmental organizations, including those relating to victim assistance and mine risk education, especially at the local level, as well as through the Voluntary Trust Fund for Assistance in Mine Action and relevant regional trust funds for assistance in mine action;
	(d)	Necessary information and technical, financial and material assistance to locate, remove, destroy and otherwise render ineffective minefields, mines, booby traps, other devices and explosive remnants of war, in accordance with international law, as soon as possible;
	(e)	Technological assistance to countries affected by mines and explosive remnants of war; 
and to promote user-oriented scientific research on and development of mine-action techniques and technology, within reasonable time frames;
	3.	Encourages efforts to conduct all mine-action activities in accordance with accepted national standards and with the International Mine Action Standards, where applicable, and emphasizes the importance of using an information management system, such as the Information Management System for Mine Action, to help facilitate mine-action activities;
	4.	Encourages all relevant multilateral, regional and national programmes and bodies to include, in coordination with the United Nations, activities related to mine action, including mine clearance, in their humanitarian, rehabilitation, reconstruction and development assistance activities, where appropriate, bearing in mind the need to ensure national and local ownership, sustainability and capacity-building, as well as to include a gender and age-appropriate perspective in all aspects of such activities;
	5.	Stresses the importance of cooperation and coordination in mine action, and emphasizes the primary responsibility of national authorities in that regard, also stresses the supporting role of the United Nations and other relevant organizations in that regard, and underlines the need for continuous assessment of the role of the United Nations in mine action;
	6.	Notes the potential that mine action can have as a peace and confidence-building measure in post-conflict situations among parties concerned;
	7.	Declares that 4 April of each year shall be officially proclaimed and observed as International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action;
	8.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution and on follow-up to previous resolutions on assistance in mine clearance and assistance in mine action, including on relevant United Nations policies and activities;
	9.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-second session the item entitled "Assistance in mine action".

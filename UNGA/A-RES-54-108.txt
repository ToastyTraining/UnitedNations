	[on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/54/614)]


	54/108.  Strengthening of the International Court of Justice


    The General Assembly,

    Recalling that the International Court of Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United Nations,

    Noting an increase in the recourse to the Court by States and the effects of such an increase on its operation,

    Recalling its resolution 53/106 of 8 December 1998, in which it requested the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization to consider practical ways and means of strengthening the International Court of Justice, 

    Bearing in mind the comments and observations submitted by the Court and by States on the consequences that the increase in the volume of cases before the Court has on its operation,1

    1.	Expresses its appreciation to the International Court of Justice for the measures adopted to operate an increased workload with maximum efficiency;


    2.	Invites the Court to keep its working methods under periodic review and to adopt additional measures aimed at expediting its proceedings;

    3.	Invites States that appear before the Court to consider favourably the guidance offered by the Court in paragraph 3 of the annex to the report of the Secretary-General containing the comments and observations of the Court,1 and to adopt, whenever possible, any other measure that may help to expedite the proceedings.

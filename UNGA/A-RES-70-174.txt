Annex

	We, Heads of State and Government, Ministers and Representatives of Member States,
	Having assembled at the Thirteenth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in Doha, from 12 to 19 April 2015, to reaffirm our shared commitment to uphold the rule of law and to prevent and counter crime in all its forms and manifestations, at the domestic and international levels, to ensure that our criminal justice systems are effective, fair, humane and accountable, to provide access to justice for all, to build effective, accountable, impartial and inclusive institutions at all levels and to uphold the principle of human dignity and the universal observance and respect of all human rights and fundamental freedoms,
	To that end, declare the following:
	1.	We acknowledge the 60-year legacy and continuing significant role of the United Nations congresses on crime prevention and criminal justice as one of the largest and most diverse international forums for the exchange of views and experiences in research, law and policy and programme development between States, intergovernmental organizations and individual experts representing various professions and disciplines in order to identify emerging trends and issues in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice. We recognize the unique and important contributions of the congresses to law and policy development, as well as to the identification of emerging trends and issues in crime prevention and criminal justice.
	2.	We reaffirm the cross-cutting nature of crime prevention and criminal justice issues and the consequent need to integrate those issues into the wider agenda of the United Nations in order to enhance system-wide coordination. We look forward to the future contributions of the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice with regard to designing and implementing national and international crime prevention and criminal justice policies and programmes, taking into account and building upon the recommendations of the congresses.
	3.	We recognize the importance of effective, fair, humane and accountable crime prevention and criminal justice systems and the institutions comprising them as a central component of the rule of law. We commit ourselves to holistic and comprehensive approaches to countering crime, violence, corruption and terrorism in all their forms and manifestations, and to ensuring that those responses are implemented in a coordinated and coherent way, along with broader programmes or measures for social and economic development, poverty eradication, respect for cultural diversity, social peace and social inclusion.
	4.	We acknowledge that sustainable development and the rule of law are strongly interrelated and mutually reinforcing. We therefore welcome the inclusive and transparent intergovernmental process for the post-2015 development agenda, which is aimed at developing global sustainable development goals to be agreed by the General Assembly, and acknowledge the proposals of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals of the Assembly as the main basis for integrating sustainable development goals into the post-2015 development agenda, while recognizing that other inputs will also be considered. In this context, we reiterate the importance of promoting peaceful, corruption-free and inclusive societies for sustainable development, with a focus on a people-centred approach that provides access to justice for all and builds effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels.
	5.	We reaffirm our commitment and strong political will in support of effective, fair, humane and accountable criminal justice systems and the institutions comprising them, and encourage the effective participation and inclusion of all sectors of society, thus creating the conditions needed to advance the wider United Nations agenda, while respecting fully the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of States and recognizing the responsibility of Member States to uphold human dignity, all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, in particular for those affected by crime and those who may be in contact with the criminal justice system, including vulnerable members of society, regardless of their status, who may be subject to multiple and aggravated forms of discrimination, and to prevent and counter crime motivated by intolerance or discrimination of any kind. To that end, we endeavour:
	(a)	To adopt comprehensive and inclusive national crime prevention and criminal justice policies and programmes that fully take into account evidence and other relevant factors, including the root causes of crime, as well as the conditions conducive to its occurrence, and, in accordance with our obligations under international law and taking into consideration relevant United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice, to ensure appropriate training of officials entrusted with upholding the rule of law and the protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms;

	6.	We welcome the work of the Expert Group on the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners and take note of the draft updated Standard Minimum Rules, as finalized by the Expert Group at its meeting held in Cape Town, South Africa, from 2 to 5 March 2015, and look forward to the consideration of this revised draft, and action thereon, by the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice.
	7.	We emphasize that education for all children and youth, including the eradication of illiteracy, is fundamental to the prevention of crime and corruption and to the promotion of a culture of lawfulness that supports the rule of law and human rights while respecting cultural identities. In this regard, we also stress the fundamental role of youth participation in crime prevention efforts. Therefore, we will endeavour:
	(a)	To create a safe, positive and secure learning environment in schools, supported by the community, including by protecting children from all forms of violence, harassment, bullying, sexual abuse and drug abuse, in accordance with domestic laws;

We encourage States parties to implement and make more effective use of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocols thereto, the United Nations Convention against Corruption, the three international drug control conventions and the international conventions and protocols related to countering terrorism, and urge all Member States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding to those instruments. We underscore that any measures taken to counter terrorism must comply with all our obligations under international law. We endeavour to enhance further international cooperation to stop the systematic exploitation of large numbers of individuals who are forced and coerced into a life of abuse and degradation. We therefore strive:

	9.	We endeavour to ensure that the benefits of economic, social and technological advancements become a positive force to enhance our efforts in preventing and countering new and emerging forms of crime. We recognize our responsibility to adequately respond to emerging and evolving threats posed by such crimes. Therefore, we strive:

In addition, we note the activities of the open-ended intergovernmental expert group to conduct a comprehensive study of the problem of cybercrime and responses to it by Member States, the international community and the private sector, and invite the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to consider recommending that the expert group continue, based on its work, to exchange information on national legislation, best practices, technical assistance and international cooperation, with a view to examining options to strengthen existing responses and to propose new national and international legal or other responses to cybercrime;

We support the development and implementation of consultative and participatory processes in crime prevention and criminal justice in order to engage all members of society, including those at risk of crime and victimization, to make our prevention efforts more effective and to galvanize public trust and confidence in criminal justice systems. We recognize our leading role and responsibility at all levels in developing and implementing crime prevention strategies and criminal justice policies at the national and subnational levels. We also recognize that, to enhance the effectiveness and fairness of such strategies, we should take measures to ensure the contribution of civil society, the private sector and academia, including the network of institutes of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme, as well as the media and all other relevant stakeholders, in the development and implementation of crime prevention policies. Therefore, we endeavour:
	(a)	To plan and implement comprehensive policies and programmes that foster socioeconomic development, with a focus on the prevention of crime, including urban crime, and violence, and to support other Member States in such endeavours, in particular through the exchange of experience and relevant information on policies and programmes that have been successful in reducing crime and violence through social policies;
	(b)	To develop awareness-raising programmes to convey key values based on the rule of law and supported by educational programmes, to be accompanied by economic and social policies promoting equality, solidarity and justice, and to reach out to young people, drawing on them as agents of positive change;
	(c)	To promote a culture of lawfulness based on the protection of human rights and the rule of law while respecting cultural identity, with particular emphasis on children and youth, seeking the support of civil society and intensifying our prevention efforts and measures targeting and using the full potential of families, schools, religious and cultural institutions, community organizations and the private sector in order to address the social and economic root causes of crime;
	(d)	To promote the management and resolution of social conflict through dialogue and mechanisms of community participation, including by raising public awareness, preventing victimization, increasing cooperation between the public, competent authorities and civil society, and promoting restorative justice;
	(e)	To raise public confidence in criminal justice by preventing corruption and promoting respect for human rights, as well as enhancing professional competence and oversight in all sectors of the criminal justice system, thus ensuring that it is accessible and responsive to the needs and rights of all individuals;
	(f)	To explore the potential for the use of traditional and new information and communications technologies in the development of policies and programmes to strengthen crime prevention and criminal justice, including for identifying public safety issues and fostering public participation;
	(g)	To promote the improvement of e-government systems in the area of crime prevention and criminal justice, with a view to enhancing public participation, and to promote the use of new technologies to facilitate cooperation and partnerships between the police and the communities they serve, as well as to share good practices and exchange information on community policing;
	(h)	To strengthen public-private partnerships in preventing and countering crime in all its forms and manifestations;
	(i)	To ensure that the content of the law is accessible to the public, and to promote, as appropriate, the transparency of criminal trials;
	(j)	To establish or build upon existing practices and measures to encourage the public, especially victims, to report and follow up on incidents of crime and corruption, and to develop and implement measures for the protection of whistle-blowers and witnesses;
	(k)	To consider partnering and supporting community initiatives and fostering the active participation of citizens in ensuring access to justice for all, including awareness of their rights, as well as their involvement in the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders, including by creating opportunities for community service and supporting the social reintegration and rehabilitation of offenders, and in that regard to encourage the sharing of best practices and the exchange of information on relevant social reintegration policies and programmes and on relevant public-private partnerships;
	(l)	To encourage the active participation of the private sector in crime prevention, as well as in social inclusion programmes and employability schemes for vulnerable members of society, including victims and those released from prison;
	(m)	To build and maintain capacities for the study of criminology, as well as forensic and correctional sciences, and to draw on contemporary scientific expertise in the design and implementation of relevant policies, programmes and projects.
	11.	As we continue our efforts to achieve the objectives set forth in the present Declaration, to enhance international cooperation, to uphold the rule of law and to ensure that our crime prevention and criminal justice systems are effective, fair, humane and accountable, we reaffirm the importance of adequate, long-term, sustainable and effective technical assistance and capacity-building policies and programmes. We therefore strive:
	(a)	To continue to provide sufficient, stable and predictable funding in support of the design and implementation of effective programmes to prevent and counter crime in all its forms and manifestations, upon the request of Member States and based on an assessment of their specific needs and priorities, in close collaboration with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime;
	(b)	To invite the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the network of institutes of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme, and all relevant United Nations entities and international and regional organizations, in fulfilment of their mandates, to continue to coordinate and cooperate with Member States to provide effective responses to the challenges faced at the national, regional and global levels, as well as to strengthen the effectiveness of public participation in crime prevention and criminal justice, including through the preparation of studies and the development and implementation of programmes.
	12.	We reaffirm that the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime remains an essential partner for the achievement of our aspirations in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice and for the implementation of the provisions of the present Declaration.
	13.	We welcome with appreciation the offer of the Government of Japan to act as host to the Fourteenth United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in 2020.
	14.	We express our profound gratitude to the people and Government of Qatar for their warm and generous hospitality and for the excellent facilities provided for the Thirteenth Congress.

	Emphasizing the multidimensional character of international migration, the importance of international, regional and bilateral cooperation and dialogue in this regard, as appropriate, and the need to protect the human rights of all migrants, particularly at a time when migration flows have increased in the globalized economy and take place in a context of continued security concerns,

	Aware that, as criminals take advantage of migratory flows and attempt to circumvent restrictive immigration policies and border controls, migrants become more vulnerable to, inter alia, kidnapping, extortion, forced labour, sexual exploitation, physical assault, debt servitude and abandonment,

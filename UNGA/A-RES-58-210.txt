58/210.	Promotion of new and renewable sources of energy, including the implementation of the World Solar Programme 1996-2005

	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 53/7 of 16 October 1998, 54/215 of 22 December 1999, 55/205 of 20 December 2000 and 56/200 of 21 December 2001 on the World Solar Programme 1996-2005,
	Recalling also the recommendations and conclusions contained in the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development ("Johannesburg Plan of Implementation")1 concerning energy for sustainable development,
	Welcoming initiatives that aim to improve access to reliable, affordable, economically viable, socially acceptable and environmentally sound energy services for sustainable development in order to contribute to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including those set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,2
	Emphasizing that the World Solar Programme 1996-2005 is aimed at encompassing all forms of new and renewable energy, including solar, thermal, photovoltaic, biomass, wind, hydro, tidal, ocean and geothermal forms,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;3
	2.	Reaffirms that the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation1 is the intergovernmental framework for energy for sustainable development agreed to at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, and calls for its full implementation;
	3.	Notes the role that the World Solar Commission continues to play in the mobilization of international support and assistance for the implementation of many of the national high-priority projects on renewable sources of energy included in the World Solar Programme 1996-2005, many of which are being executed with national funding;
	4.	Notes also that although significant financial support has been provided by some developed countries that are Members of the United Nations and by some intergovernmental organizations, both within and outside the United Nations system, in the implementation of the World Solar Programme 1996-2005, more action still needs to be taken in this regard;
	5.	Recognizes that rural energy services, including their financing, should be designed to maximize local ownership, as appropriate;
	6.	Encourages the United Nations system to continue to raise awareness of the importance of energy for sustainable development, including the need for the promotion of new and renewable sources of energy and the implementation of the World Solar Programme 1996-2005, particularly in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication;
	7.	Emphasizes the need to intensify research and development in support of energy for sustainable development, which will require increased commitment on the part of all stakeholders, including Governments and the private sector, to deploy financial and human resources for accelerating research efforts;
	8.	Stresses that the wider use of available renewable sources of energy requires technology transfer and diffusion on a global scale, including through North-South and South-South cooperation;
	9.	Calls upon Governments, as well as relevant regional and international organizations and other relevant stakeholders, to combine, as appropriate, the increased use of renewable energy resources, more efficient use of energy, greater reliance on advanced energy technologies, including advanced and cleaner fossil fuel technologies, and the sustainable use of traditional energy resources, which could meet the growing need for energy services in the longer term to achieve sustainable development;
	10.	Encourages national and regional initiatives on renewable energies to promote access to energy, including renewable energy, for the poorest and to improve energy efficiency and conservation by resorting to a mix of available technologies, taking into full account the provisions of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation concerning energy for sustainable development;
	11.	Welcomes the initiative by the Government of Germany to host the International Conference for Renewable Energies, in Bonn, from 1 to 4 June 2004;
	12.	Invites the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to continue to make effective the implementation of the Global Renewable Energy Education and Training Programme 1996-2005 in the various regions;
	13.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution;
	14.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixtieth session, under the item entitled "Environment and sustainable development", the sub-item entitled "Promotion of new and renewable sources of energy, including the implementation of the World Solar Programme 1996-2005".

	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,1 
	Acknowledging the work of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research on the functioning of the Institute, 
	Noting the continued progress made by the Institute in its various programmes and activities, including the strengthened cooperation with other organizations of the United Nations system and with regional and national institutions, 
	Expressing its appreciation to the Governments and private institutions that have made or pledged financial and other contributions to the Institute, 
	Noting the slight improvement in the financial situation of the Institute, and expressing its appreciation to those who have contributed to this improvement, 
	Noting also, however, that the bulk of the resources contributed to the Institute are directed to the Special Purpose Grants Fund rather than to the General Fund, stressing the need to address that unbalanced situation, and also noting that the participation of the developed countries in training programmes in New York and Geneva is increasing,
	Noting further that the Institute is funded from voluntary contributions and that it delivers, free of charge, training courses to diplomats and delegates accredited to United Nations Headquarters in New York and to the United Nations offices at Geneva, Vienna and Nairobi,
	Noting the various ongoing training programmes of the Institute, including those in the field of sustainable development, 
	Reiterating that training activities should be accorded a more visible and larger role in support of the management of international affairs and in the execution of the economic and social development programmes of the United Nations system, 
	1.	Reaffirms the importance of a coordinated United Nations system-wide approach to research and training, based on an effective coherent strategy and an effective division of work among the relevant institutions and bodies; 
	2.	Also reaffirms the relevance of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, in view of the growing importance of training within the United Nations and the training requirements of States and local authorities, and the relevance of the training-related research activities undertaken by the Institute within its mandate; 
	3.	Welcomes the progress made in building partnerships between the Institute and other organizations and bodies of the United Nations system with respect to their training programmes, and in this context underlines the need to develop further and to expand the scope of those partnerships, in particular at the country level; 
	4.	Requests the Board of Trustees of the Institute to continue to ensure fair and equitable geographical distribution and transparency in the preparation of the programmes and in the employment of experts, and in this regard stresses that the courses of the Institute should focus primarily on development issues and the management of international affairs; 
	5.	Renews its appeal to all Governments, in particular those of developed countries, and to private institutions that have not yet contributed financially or otherwise to the Institute to give it their generous financial and other support, and urges the States that have interrupted their voluntary contributions to consider resuming them in view of the successful restructuring and revitalization of the Institute; 
	6.	Encourages the Board of Trustees to consider diversifying further the venues of the events organized by the Institute and to include among those venues the cities hosting regional commissions, in order to promote greater participation and reduce costs; 
	7.	Stresses the need for the expeditious resolution of the issues related to the Institute's rent, rental rates and maintenance costs, taking into account its financial situation, as recommended in the report of the Secretary-General;1 
	8.	Encourages the Board of Trustees of the Institute to continue its efforts to resolve the critical financial situation of the Institute, in particular with a view to broadening its donor base and further increasing the contributions to the General Fund; 
	9.	Urges the Board of Trustees of the Institute to complete expeditiously the implementation of the recommendations of the Board of Auditors made in respect of the biennium 2002-2003; 2
	10.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution, including details on the status of contributions to and the financial situation of the Institute;
	11.	Invites the Secretary-General, after consultation with the Board of Trustees of the Institute, in accordance with article XI of the statute of the Institute, to consider the desirability of reformulating article V, paragraph 2(j), of the statute so that the report of the Secretary-General may be submitted to the Economic and Social Council rather than to the General Assembly, and include the findings in his report to the General Assembly at its sixty-second session.

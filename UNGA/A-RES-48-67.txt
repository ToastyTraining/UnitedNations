	Noting that qualitative improvements in science and technology with military applications have implications for international security and that States, in this regard, should assess carefully the impact of the use of science and technology on international security,

	2/	Ibid., para. 31.

	3/	A/48/360.



	Recalling that norms and guidelines for the transfer of high technology with military applications should take into account legitimate requirements for the maintenance of international peace and security, while ensuring that they do not deny access to high-technology products, services and know-how for peaceful purposes,


	Emphasizing that commitment to, and the fulfilment of, comprehensive and balanced objectives of non-proliferation in all its aspects pertaining to the acquisition or transfer of high technology relevant to weapons of mass destruction are essential for the maintenance of international security and international cooperation and for the promotion of transfers of such technology for peaceful purposes,

	Noting the interest of the international community in cooperation in the fields of disarmament-related science and technology and the transfer of high technology with military applications,

	Mindful that international cooperation should be encouraged with respect to the production of disarmament-related technical equipment with the purpose, inter alia, of reducing the costs of implementing arms limitation and disarmament agreements,

	1.	Calls upon the Disarmament Commission to conclude its work on the agenda item entitled "The role of science and technology in the context of international security, disarmament and other related fields" in 1994 and to submit as soon as possible specific recommendations on this matter to the General Assembly;

	2.	Requests the Conference on Disarmament to pursue constructively in response to General Assembly resolution 46/36 L of 9 December 1991 its work on the agenda item entitled "Transparency in armaments", which includes consideration of the elaboration of practical means to increase openness and transparency related to the transfer of high technology with military applications;

	3.	Invites Member States to undertake additional efforts to apply science and technology for disarmament-related purposes and to make disarmament-related technologies available to interested States;

	4.	Also invites Member States to widen multilateral dialogue, bearing in mind the proposal for seeking universally acceptable norms or guidelines that would regulate international transfers of high technology with military applications;

	5.	Encourages the United Nations to contribute, within existing mandates, to promoting the application of science and technology for peaceful purposes;

	6.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its forty-ninth session the item entitled "The role of science and technology in the context of international security, disarmament and other related fields".

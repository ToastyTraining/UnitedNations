	Bearing in mind that African countries have primary responsibility for their own economic and social development and that the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized, and bearing in mind also the need for their development efforts to be supported by an enabling international economic environment, and in this regard recalling the support given by the International Conference on Financing for Development to the New Partnership,4
	Emphasizing that a favourable national and international environment for Africa's growth and development is important for progress in the implementation of the New Partnership,5
	Stressing the need to implement all commitments by the international community regarding the economic and social development of Africa,
	1.	Welcomes the eighth consolidated report of the Secretary-General;6
	2.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on a monitoring mechanism to review commitments towards Africa's development needs;7
	3.	Reaffirms its full support for the implementation of the New Partnership for Africa's Development;5
	4.	Reaffirms its commitment to the full implementation of the political declaration on Africa's development needs,2 as reaffirmed in the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development, adopted as the outcome document of the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus, held in Doha from 29 November to 2 December 2008;8
	5.	Recognizes the progress made in the implementation of the New Partnership as well as regional and international support for the New Partnership, while acknowledging that much needs to be done in its implementation;
	6.	Takes note of the Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying Our Efforts to Eliminate HIV and AIDS, adopted at the high-level meeting on HIV/AIDS on 10 June 2011;9
	7.	Recognizes that HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases pose severe risks for the entire world and serious challenges to the achievement of development goals;
	8.	Recalls, in this regard, the commitment to pursue all necessary efforts to scale up support for nationally driven, sustainable and comprehensive responses in Africa to achieve broad multisectoral coverage for prevention, treatment, care and support, with the full and active participation of people living with HIV, vulnerable groups, most affected communities, civil society and the private sector, towards achieving the goal of universal access to comprehensive prevention programmes, treatment, care and support by 2010, in line with the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS of 2 June 2006;10
	9.	Reaffirms its commitment to redouble efforts to achieve universal access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support services as an essential step in achieving Millennium Development Goal 6 and as a contribution to reaching the other Millennium Development Goals;
	10.	Reaffirms the resolve to provide assistance for prevention and care, with the aim of ensuring an HIV/AIDS-, malaria- and tuberculosis-free Africa, by addressing the needs of all, in particular the needs of women, children and young people, and by achieving as closely as possible the goal of universal access to comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention programmes, treatment, care and support in African countries, to accelerate and intensify efforts to expand access to affordable and quality medicines in Africa, including antiretroviral drugs, inter alia, by encouraging pharmaceutical companies to make drugs available, and to ensure strengthened global partnership and increased bilateral and multilateral assistance, where possible on a grant basis, to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other infectious diseases in Africa through the strengthening of health systems; 
	11.	Expresses deep concern about the ongoing adverse impacts of crises, including the global financial and economic crisis, volatile energy and food prices and ongoing concerns over food security, as well as the increasing challenges posed by climate change, drought, land degradation, desertification and the loss of biodiversity, and the serious challenges these impacts pose to the fight against poverty and hunger, which could further undermine the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in Africa;
	12.	Expresses grave concern that Africa is among the hardest hit by the impact of the world financial and economic crisis, recognizes that, while growth is returning, there is a need to sustain the recovery, which is fragile and uneven, and therefore reaffirms that it will continue to support the special needs of Africa and take action to mitigate the multidimensional impacts of the crisis on the continent;
	13.	Expresses concern at Africa's disproportionately low share in the volume of international trade, which stands at only 2 per cent, and also expresses concern that, despite an overall increase in the nominal volume and share of official development assistance to Africa, such assistance will likely rise by just 1 per cent a year in real terms, compared to the average 13 per cent rate of growth over the past three years, and that, at this rate, any additional aid to African countries will be outpaced by population growth, the increased debt burden of some African countries, the rising unemployment rate, the fall in capital inflows and the significant fall in remittances to the continent as a result of the world financial and economic crisis, which have a negative impact on the hard-earned socio-economic and political gains that Africa has achieved in recent years;
	14.	Notes that foreign direct investment is a major source of financing for development, and in this regard calls upon developed countries to continue to devise source-country measures to encourage and facilitate the flow of foreign direct investment, inter alia, through the provision of export credits and other lending instruments, risk guarantees and business development services;
	15.	Calls upon developing countries and countries with economies in transition to continue their efforts to create a domestic environment conducive to attracting investments by, inter alia, achieving a transparent, stable and predictable investment climate with proper contract enforcement and respect for property rights;
	16.	Stresses the importance of enhancing efforts to mobilize investments from all sources in human resources and physical, environmental, institutional and social infrastructure;
	17.	Reaffirms the need to enhance the voice and participation of developing countries, including African countries, in international economic decision-making and norm-setting, notes recent steps being taken in this regard, and emphasizes in this context that the efforts to address the ongoing impact of the world economic and financial crisis should not lead to further marginalization of the African continent;

	30.

	39.	Acknowledges efforts by developed countries to increase resources for development, including commitments by some developed countries to increase official development assistance, and calls for the fulfilment of all official development assistance commitments, including the commitments by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance to developing countries by 2015 and to reach the level of at least 0.5 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance by 2010, as well as the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance to least developed countries, and urges those developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete efforts in this regard in accordance with their reiterated commitments;

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/52/937)]


52/241.Financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

	Having considered also the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the termination benefits paid to the locally employed civilians in the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus,3

	Recalling Security Council resolution 186 (1964) of 4 March 1964, by which the Council established the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force, the latest of which was resolution 1146 (1997) of 23 December 1997,

	Recalling also its resolution 51/235 of 13 June 1997 on the financing of the Force,


	Reaffirming that the costs of the Force that are not covered by voluntary contributions are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force by certain Governments,

	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Expressing its appreciation to all those Member States and observer States which have made voluntary contributions to the Special Account established for the financing of the Force for the period prior to 16 June 1993,

	Noting that voluntary contributions were insufficient to cover all of the costs of the Force, including those incurred by troop-contributing Governments prior to 16 June 1993, and regretting the absence of an adequate response to appeals for voluntary contributions, including that contained in the letter dated 17 May 1994 from the Secretary-General to all Member States,4

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus as at 15 May 1998, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 15.3 million United States dollars, representing 13.2 per cent of the total assessed contributions from 16 June 1993 to the period ending 30 June 1998, notes that some 21.1 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Force in full and on time;

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Force is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

	9.	Decides also, as an ad hoc arrangement, taking into consideration the funding through voluntary contributions of one third of the cost of the Force, equivalent to 215,800 dollars, by the Government of Cyprus, to apportion among Member States the additional amount of 387,100 dollars gross (431,600 dollars net), in addition to the amount of 45,079,500 dollars gross (43,049,600 dollars net) already authorized under the provisions of General Assembly resolution 50/236 for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997, in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996, 51/218 A to C of 18 December 1996 and 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and 50/451 B  of 23 December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the years 1998 and 1999, as set out in its resolution 52/215 A of 22 December 1997;

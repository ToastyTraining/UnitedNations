	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolutions 47/227 of 8 April 1993, 48/207 of 21 December 1993, 49/125 of 19 December 1994, 50/121 of 20 December 1995, 51/188 of 16 December 1996 and 52/206 of 18 December 1997,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General1 and the report of the Executive Director of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research on the activities of the Institute,2

	Welcoming the successful restructuring of the Institute and the recent progress made by the Institute in its various programmes and activities, including the improved cooperation that has been established with other organizations of the United Nations system and with regional and national institutions,

	Noting the relevant recommendations of the Joint Inspection Unit in its report entitled "Training institutions in the United Nations system: programmes and activities",3


	Expressing its appreciation to the Governments and private institutions that have made or pledged financial and other contributions to the Institute,

	Noting that contributions to the General Fund of the Institute have not increased along with the increased participation of the developed countries in the training programmes, and underlining the need to address urgently this discrepancy,

	Reiterating that the funding of training programmes offered at the specific request of States or departments and units of the Organization and other organs of the United Nations system and the specialized agencies should be arranged by the requesting parties,

	Recognizing that training activities should be accorded a more visible and larger role in support of the management of international affairs and in the execution of the economic and social development programmes of the United Nations system,

	1.	Reaffirms the importance of a coordinated United Nations system-wide approach to research and training and underlines the need for United Nations training and research institutions to avoid duplication in their work;

	2.	Reaffirms also the relevance of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, in view of the growing importance of training within the United Nations and the training requirements of States, and the pertinence of research activities related to training undertaken by the Institute within its mandate;

	3.	Stresses the need for the Institute to strengthen further its cooperation with other United Nations institutes and relevant national, regional and international institutes;

	4.	Also stresses the need for continuity in the management of the Institute in order to ensure efficient and effective completion of the process of restructuring and revitalization;

	5.	Renews its appeal to all Governments and to private institutions that have not yet contributed financially or otherwise to the Institute to give it their generous financial and other support, and urges the States that interrupted their voluntary contributions to consider resuming them in view of the successful restructuring and revitalization of the Institute;

	6.	Encourages the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research to continue its efforts to address the discrepancy between the contributions to the General Fund of the Institute and participation in its programmes;

	7.	Stresses the need for enhanced coordination between the main training and research institutions of the United Nations system, based on an effective division of labour among these institutions;

	8.	Notes the survey prepared by the Institute of training institutes and training programmes within the United Nations,4 and requests the Secretary-General, in close cooperation with the Institute, to prepare, from within existing financial resources, an assessment of the survey with a view to highlighting the lessons learned from the responses already received, providing a qualitative assessment of pedagogical methods followed by these institutions in the provision of their training services and highlighting the complementarities and synergies that were apparent in the survey;


	9.	Welcomes the progress made in building partnerships between the Institute and other agencies and bodies of the United Nations system with respect to their training programmes, especially for developing countries and countries with economies in transition, consistent with the division of labour;

	10.	Underlines the need to develop further and expand the scope of these partnerships, particularly at the country level;

	11.	Requests the Board of Trustees to attract, to the extent possible, experts from developing countries and countries with economies in transition for the preparation of the relevant training materials for the programmes and activities of the Institute;

	12.	Calls upon the Secretary-General to continue to explore all possible ways and means to provide additional facilities to the Institute for maintaining its offices and for conducting programmes and training courses that are provided at no cost to States and to their representatives accredited to United Nations offices in New York, Nairobi, Geneva and Vienna;

	13.	Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Institute, as well as with the United Nations funds and programmes, to continue to explore ways and modalities to utilize systematically the Institute in the execution of training and capacity-building programmes;

	14.	Also requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session on the implementation of the present resolution.

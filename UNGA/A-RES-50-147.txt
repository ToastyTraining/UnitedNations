	Recalling also Economic and Social Council resolution 1994/21 of 25 July 1994,

	Aware of the financial difficulties that the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders continues to face as a result of the fact that many States of the African region are in the category of least developed countries and therefore lack the necessary resources with which to support the Institute,

	Conscious of the efforts made thus far by the Institute in fulfilling its mandate through, inter alia, the organization of training programmes and regional seminars, as well as the provision of advisory services,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General, 1/

	1.	Commends the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders for the activities it has undertaken, despite its difficulties in fulfilling its mandate, as reflected in the progress report of the Secretary-General on the activities of the United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute and other institutes; 2/


	2.	Expresses its appreciation to those Governments and intergovernmental bodies which have supported the Institute in the discharge of its responsibilities;

	3.	Appeals to Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to provide financial and technical support to the Institute to enable it to fulfil its objectives, in particular those concerning training, technical assistance, policy guidance, research and data collection;

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the Institute is provided with adequate funds, within the overall appropriation of the programme budget and from extrabudgetary resources, and to submit proposals for any necessary additional funding of the Institute, in accordance with General Assembly resolution 49/156 and its decision 49/480 of 6 April 1995;

	5.	Requests the Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme to reconsider its decision with regard to its financial support to the Institute and to continue providing appropriate funds for the institutional strengthening and the implementation of the programme of work of the Institute, taking into account the difficult economic and financial situation faced by many countries in the African region;

	6.	Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure proper follow-up with all concerned on the implementation of the present resolution and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session and to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its fifth session.

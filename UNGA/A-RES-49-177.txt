	7.	Invites States parties to consider contributing to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Victims of Torture as a gesture reflecting the determination of States to promote human rights;

	8.	Welcomes the attention that the Committee against Torture has given to the development of an effective system of reporting on the implementation of the Convention by States parties, and especially its revision of its general guidelines for the submission of reports by States parties, as well as its practice of formulating concluding observations after the consideration of such reports;

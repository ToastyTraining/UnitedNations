65/190.	Trafficking in women and girls


	The General Assembly,
	Reiterating its strong condemnation of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, which constitutes a serious threat to human dignity, human rights and development,
	Recalling all international conventions that deal specifically with and address issues relevant to the problem of trafficking in women and girls, such as the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime1 and the Protocols thereto, in particular the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime2 and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,3 the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women4 and the Optional Protocol thereto,5 the Convention on the Rights of the Child6 and the Optional Protocol thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography,7 and the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others,8 as well as previous resolutions of the General Assembly and its subsidiary body the Human Rights Council, and the Economic and Social Council and its functional commissions on the issue,
	Reaffirming the provisions pertaining to trafficking in women and girls contained in the outcome documents of relevant international conferences and summits, in particular the strategic objective on the issue of trafficking contained in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women,9
	Reaffirming also the commitment made by world leaders at the Millennium Summit, the 2005 World Summit and the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals to devise, enforce and strengthen effective measures to combat and eliminate all forms of trafficking in persons to counter the demand for trafficked victims and to protect the victims,
	Welcoming the adoption of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons10 by the General Assembly on 30 July 2010,
	Welcoming also the resolutions on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, adopted by the Human Rights Council, in particular resolution 11/3 of 17 June 2009 on trafficking in persons, especially women and children,11 and resolution 14/2 of 17 June 2010 entitled "Trafficking in persons, especially women and children: regional and subregional cooperation in promoting a human rights-based approach to combating trafficking in persons",12
	Noting with appreciation the steps taken, including the reports of human rights treaty bodies and the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, the Special Rapporteur of the Council on violence against women, its causes and consequences, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, the Special Rapporteur of the Council on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography and the Special Rapporteur of the Council on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, and United Nations agencies and other concerned intergovernmental and governmental organizations, within their existing mandates, as well as civil society, to address the serious crime of trafficking in persons, and encourages them to continue doing so and to share their knowledge and best practices as widely as possible,
	Recalling the Global Report on Trafficking in Persons published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in February 2009 and the attention paid in it to the situation of trafficked women and girls, as well as other relevant reports of the Office on trafficking in persons,
	Taking note of the Vienna Forum to Fight Human Trafficking, held from 13 to 15 February 2008, within the framework of the United Nations Global Initiative to Fight Human Trafficking, and of the thematic debates on the issue of trafficking in persons, held on 3 June 2008 and 13 May 2009 within the framework of the General Assembly,
	Taking note also of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and of the fact that part of her task is to integrate a gender- and age-specific perspective throughout the work of her mandate, inter alia, through the identification of gender- and age-specific vulnerabilities in relation to the issue of trafficking in persons,
	Acknowledging the inclusion of gender-related crimes in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,13 which entered into force on 1 July 2002,
	Bearing in mind that all States have an obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and punish perpetrators of trafficking in persons, and to rescue victims as well as provide for their protection, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the victims,
	Seriously concerned that an increasing number of women and girls are being trafficked, including to developed countries, as well as within and between regions and States, and that men and boys are also victims of trafficking, including for sexual exploitation,
	Recognizing that certain efforts against trafficking in persons lack the gender and age sensitivity needed to address effectively the situation of women and girls, who are particularly vulnerable to trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced labour, services and other forms of exploitation, thus highlighting the need to incorporate a gender- and age-sensitive approach in all anti-trafficking efforts,
	Recognizing also the need to address the impact of globalization on the particular problem of trafficking in women and children, in particular girls,
	Recognizing further that, despite the progress made, challenges to combating trafficking in women and girls remain and that further efforts should be made to adopt adequate legislation and to implement existing legislation and to continue improving the collection of reliable sex-disaggregated data and statistics that would allow proper analysis of the nature and extent of trafficking in women and girls,
	Concerned about the use of new information technologies, including the Internet, for purposes of exploitation of the prostitution of others, for trafficking in women as brides, for sex tourism exploiting women and children and for child pornography, paedophilia and any other forms of sexual exploitation of children,
	Concerned also about the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without regard to dangerous and inhuman conditions and in flagrant violation of domestic laws and international standards,
	Recognizing that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and girl victims are often subject to multiple forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of their gender, age, ethnicity, culture and religion, as well as their origins, and that those forms of discrimination themselves may fuel trafficking in persons,
	Noting that some of the demand for prostitution and forced labour is met by trafficking in persons in some parts of the world,
	Acknowledging that women and girl victims of trafficking, on account of their gender, are further disadvantaged and marginalized by a general lack of information on or awareness and recognition of their human rights and by the stigmatization often associated with trafficking, as well as by the obstacles they meet in gaining access to information and recourse mechanisms in cases of violation of their rights, and that special measures are required for their protection and to increase their awareness,
	Reaffirming the importance of bilateral, subregional, regional and international cooperation mechanisms and initiatives, including information exchanges on best practices, of Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to address the problem of trafficking in persons, especially women and children,
	Reaffirming also that global efforts, including international cooperation and technical assistance programmes, to eradicate trafficking in persons, especially women and children, demand the strong political commitment, shared responsibility and active cooperation of all Governments of countries of origin, transit and destination,
	Recognizing that policies and programmes for prevention, rehabilitation, repatriation and reintegration should be developed through a gender- and age-sensitive, comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach, with concern for the security of the victims and respect for the full enjoyment of their human rights and with the involvement of all actors in countries of origin, transit and destination,
	Convinced of the need to protect and assist all victims of trafficking, with full respect for the human rights of the victims,

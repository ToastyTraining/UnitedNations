	Recognizing the impact of factors such as climate change on the production of agricultural commodities, 
	Recognizing also that uncertainty in global commodity markets reinforces the need to comprehensively deal with the commodity problematique, inter alia, the demand for commodities, supply capacities, commodity revenues and investments in commodity-dependent economies, while taking due account of the diversity of each country's individual situation and needs and the promotion of their sustainable development, and to strengthen the nexus between trade, food, finance, investment in sustainable agriculture, energy and industrialization, 
	Stressing the importance of policies to address longer-term structural issues of the commodity economy and integrate commodity policies into wider development and poverty eradication strategies at all levels, 
	Taking note of all relevant voluntary initiatives aimed at improving transparency in commodity markets and mitigating the impact of excessive price volatility,

	3.	Calls upon the international community to support the efforts of commodity-dependent developing countries to address the factors that create structural barriers to international trade and impede, inter alia, diversification, including tariff and non-tariff barriers, limited access to financial services resulting in scarce resources for investing in the commodity sector, weak infrastructure, particularly as regards both the cost and availability of transportation and storage, and lack of skills in producing and marketing alternative products; 
	4.	Calls for, in that regard, the successful conclusion of the Doha Development Round of trade negotiations with a development-oriented outcome that ensures, inter alia, greater market access for products from developing countries; 
	5.	Also calls for a coherent set of policy actions at the national, regional and international levels to address excessive price volatility and support commodity-dependent developing countries in mitigating negative impacts, in particular by facilitating value addition and enhancing their participation in commodity and related product value chains, by supporting large-scale diversification of these economies and by encouraging the use and further development of market-oriented risk management tools, instruments and strategies; 
	6.

Stresses that technical assistance and capacity-building aimed at improving the commodity export competitiveness of producers is particularly important, especially in Africa, and invites the donor community to provide necessary resources for commodity-specific, financial and technical assistance, in particular for human and institutional capacity-building, as well as infrastructure development of developing countries, with a view to reducing their institutional bottlenecks and transaction costs and enhancing their commodity trade and development in accordance with national development plans; 
	11.	Also stresses that the Aid for Trade initiative should aim to help developing countries, particularly least developed countries, to build the supply-side capacity and trade-related infrastructure that they need to assist them to implement and benefit from World Trade Organization agreements and, more broadly, to expand their trade; 
	12.	Underlines the important contribution of the commodities sector to rural development, in particular to providing rural employment and income, and to the efforts for achieving food security; 
	13.	Emphasizes the importance of international measures and national strategies to improve the performance of the agricultural sector, including the functioning of markets and trading systems, to ensure a better supply-side response from producers, in particular small farmers, in order to incentivize them to take the risks inherent in investing in increased and diversified production; 
	14.	Stresses the importance of managing excessive price volatility, including, inter alia, through the development of appropriate non-trade-distorting tools at the international level and the improvement of transparency in the international market;

	16.	Encourages developed countries that have not already done so and developing countries declaring themselves in a position to do so to take steps towards the goal of realizing timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access on a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration adopted by the World Trade Organization in 2005;15 
	17.	Calls upon international financial institutions and development banks to assist developing countries, in particular commodity-dependent developing countries, in managing the effects of excessive price volatility; 
	18.	Reaffirms that every State has and shall freely exercise full permanent sovereignty over all its wealth, natural resources and economic activities;

	20.	Also recognizes the important contributions of the Common Fund for Commodities and other international commodities organizations, and encourages them, in cooperation with the International Trade Centre, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization and other relevant bodies, to continue to strengthen coordination among themselves and study ways to establish greater stability in the commodities market as well as to enhance activities in developing countries to improve access to markets and reliability of supply, enhancing diversification and addition of value, improving the competitiveness of commodities, strengthening the market chain, improving market structures, broadening the export base and ensuring the effective participation of all stakeholders; 
	21.	Stresses that the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and its partners, in the spirit of inter-agency cooperation and multi-stakeholder partnerships and within their respective mandates, should continue to engage actively in collaborative research and analysis of the commodity problematique and related capacity and consensus-building activities with a view to providing regular analysis and policy advice relevant to the sustainable development of commodity-dependent developing countries, particularly low-income countries;

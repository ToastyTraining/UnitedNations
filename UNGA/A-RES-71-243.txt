	53.	Stresses that the resident coordinator system, which encompasses all entities of the United Nations development system at the country level dealing with operational activities for development, while managed by the United Nations Development Programme, is owned by the United Nations development system as a whole and that its functioning should be participatory, collegial and mutually accountable within that system;

	61.	Welcomes the achievements of the United Nations development system in promoting more effective integrated support, including delivering as one, and requests the United Nations development system to continue to deepen this approach in programme countries that have voluntarily adopted it, including opportunities to address cross-cutting issues, offer an integrated package of support, including specific programming support, monitoring and evaluation, reporting, pooled and flexible financing, as well as support for the resident coordinator system and simplification and harmonization of business practices, including ways to improve the effectiveness, impact and financing of a flexible, differentiated and multi-country presence; 
	62.	Encourages the progressive implementation of standard operating procedures and business operating strategies;

VI

	Reaffirming that the management and use of Antarctica should be conducted in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and of promoting international cooperation for the benefit of mankind as a whole,

	Recognizing that the Antarctic Treaty,1 which provides, inter alia, for the demilitarization of the continent, the prohibition of nuclear explosions and the disposal of nuclear wastes, the freedom of scientific research and the free exchange of scientific information, is in furtherance of the purposes and principles of the Charter,


	Welcoming the entry into force of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty2 on 14 January 1998, under which Antarctica has been designated as a natural reserve, devoted to peace and science, and the provisions contained in the Protocol regarding the protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems, including the need for environmental impact assessment in the planning and conduct of all relevant activities in Antarctica,

	Welcoming also the continuing cooperation among countries undertaking scientific research activities in Antarctica, which may help to minimize human impact on the Antarctic environment,

	Welcoming further the increasing awareness of an interest in Antarctica shown by the international community, and convinced of the advantages to the whole of mankind of a better knowledge of Antarctica,

	Reaffirming its conviction that, in the interest of all mankind, Antarctica should continue for ever to be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and that it should not become the scene or object of international discord,

	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the question of Antarctica3 and the role accorded by the Secretary-General to the United Nations Environment Programme in preparing his report and also of the Twenty-first, Twenty-second and Twenty-third Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings, which were held at Christchurch, New Zealand, from 19 to 30 May 1997, at Tromso, Norway, from 25 May to 5 June 1998, and at Lima, from 24 May to 4 June 1999, respectively;

	2.	Recalls the statement under chapter 17 of Agenda 21,4 adopted by the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, that States carrying out research activities in Antarctica should, as provided for in article III of the Antarctic Treaty, continue:

	(a)	To ensure that data and information resulting from such research are freely available to the international community;

	(b)	To enhance the access of the international scientific community and the specialized agencies of the United Nations system to such data and information, including the encouragement of periodic seminars and symposia;

	3.	Welcomes the invitations to the Executive Director of the United Nations Environment Programme to attend Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings in order to assist such meetings in their substantive work, and urges the parties to continue to do so for future consultative meetings;

	4.

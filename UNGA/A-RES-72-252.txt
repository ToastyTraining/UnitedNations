	Underlining the shared responsibility to pursue the full truth concerning the conditions and circumstances resulting in the tragic death of Dag Hammarskjöld and of the members of the party accompanying him,
	Recognizing that a further inquiry or investigation would be necessary to finally establish the facts of the matter,
	Expressing appreciation for the continuing commitment of the Secretary-General to the search for the truth in this regard,
	Welcoming the report of the Eminent Person appointed pursuant to General Assembly resolution 71/260,1 and recognizing the contributions by Member States to his work,
	Acknowledging the letter dated 5 September 2017 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the General Assembly, transmitting the report of the Eminent Person, together with his assessment of the way forward,1 
	Noting, in particular, the conclusion drawn by the Eminent Person that it appears plausible that an external attack or threat may have been the cause of the crash, whether by way of a direct attack causing flight SE-BDY to crash or by causing a momentary distraction of the pilots, 
	1.	Requests the Secretary-General to reappoint the Eminent Person appointed pursuant to General Assembly resolution 71/260 to continue to review the potential new information, including that which may be available from Member States, to assess its probative value, to determine the scope that any further inquiry or investigation should take and, if possible, to draw conclusions from the investigations already conducted;
	2.	Urges all Member States to release any relevant records in their possession and to provide to the Secretary-General relevant information related to the death of Dag Hammarskjöld and of the members of the party accompanying him;
	3.	Encourages Member States to ensure that any relevant records related to the death of Dag Hammarskjöld and of the members of the party accompanying him that remain classified, more than 50 years after the fact, are declassified or otherwise made available for review; 
	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the United Nations reviews its own specific records and archives for possible declassification of information relevant to the death of Dag Hammarskjöld and of the members of the party accompanying him;
	5.	Encourages all Member States that may hold relevant information related to the death of Dag Hammarskjöld and of the members of the party accompanying him to appoint, without any delay, an independent and high-ranking official to conduct a dedicated internal review of their intelligence, security and defence archives to determine whether relevant information exists, and to communicate a summary of the results to the Secretary-General before the end of the main part of its seventy-third session under such confidentiality arrangements as presented in the report of the Eminent Person;
	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to explore the feasibility of establishing a central archival holding or other holistic arrangement for records and archives related to the death of Dag Hammarskjöld and of the members of the party accompanying him and to provide to the General Assembly concrete and actionable recommendations thereon; 
	7.	Also requests the Secretary-General to provide an oral briefing on any progress made to the General Assembly before the end of the main part of its seventy-third session and to report to the Assembly before the end of its seventy-third session on any further progress made; 
	8.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-fourth session the item entitled "Investigation into the conditions and circumstances resulting in the tragic death of Dag Hammarskjöld and of the members of the party accompanying him".

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Third Committee (A/53/625/Add.5)


53/167. 	Question of resources for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the human rights activities of the United Nations	

    
    The General Assembly,

     Taking note of Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/83 of 24 April 19981 on the question of resources for the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the human rights activities of the United Nations, in which the Commission expressed its concern that, with the resources currently available from the United Nations regular budget, the High Commissioner would not be in a position to fulfil the full range of established and new mandates, and therefore appealed to the Secretary-General, the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly to take all necessary steps, without delay, to secure for the Office of the High Commissioner and other relevant components of the Organization regular budget resources for the current and future bienniums that would be sufficient to permit the effective fulfilment of the responsibilities and mandates established by Member States and commensurate with the importance assigned in the Charter of the United Nations to the promotion and protection of human rights,


     Taking note also of Economic and Social Council decision 1998/275 of 30 July 1998, in which the Council, taking note of Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/83, approved the appeal made by the Commission to the Council, the Secretary-General and the General Assembly,

    Taking note further of other relevant resolutions and decisions of the Commission on Human Rights, the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly containing requests and proposals concerning the regular budget for the human rights programme,

    1.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary steps, without delay, to follow up Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/83 and Economic and Social Council decision 1998/275, in particular in the preparation of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001, without diverting resources from United Nations development programmes and activities;

    2.	Decides to continue its consideration of this question at its fifty-fourth session under the item entitled "Human rights questions".

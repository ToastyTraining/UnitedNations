	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/48/613)]


		48/33.Model Law on Procurement of Goods and Construction      of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966, by which it created the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law with a mandate to further the progressive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade and in that respect to bear in mind the interests of all peoples, in particular those of developing countries, in the extensive development of international trade,

	Noting that procurement constitutes a large portion of public expenditure of most States,

	Noting also that a model law on procurement establishing procedures designed to foster integrity, confidence, fairness and transparency in the procurement process will also promote economy, efficiency and competition in procurement and thus lead to increased economic development,

	Being of the opinion that the establishment of a model law on procurement that is acceptable to States with different legal, social and economic systems contributes to the development of harmonious international economic relations,








	Being convinced that the Model Law on Procurement of Goods and Construction of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law 1/ will significantly assist all States, including developing countries and States whose economies are in transition, in enhancing their existing procurement laws and formulating procurement laws where none presently exist,


	1.	Takes note with satisfaction of the completion and adoption by the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law of the Model Law on Procurement of Goods and Construction together with the Guide to Enactment of the Model Law; 2/

	2.	Recommends that, in view of the desirability of improvement and uniformity of the laws of procurement, States give favourable consideration to the Model Law when they enact or revise their procurement laws;

	3.	Recommends also that all efforts be made to ensure that the Model Law together with the Guide become generally known and available.

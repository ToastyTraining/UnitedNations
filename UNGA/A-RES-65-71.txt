Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 8 December 2010
[on the report of the First Committee (A/65/410)]
65/71.	Decreasing the operational readiness of nuclear weapons systems


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 62/36 of 5 December 2007 and 63/41 of 2 December 2008, 
	Recalling also that the maintenance of nuclear weapons on high alert was a feature of cold war nuclear postures, and welcoming the increased confidence and transparency since the cessation of the cold war,
	Concerned that, notwithstanding the end of the cold war, several thousand nuclear weapons remain on high alert, ready to be launched within minutes,
	Noting the continuing engagement in multilateral disarmament forums in support of further reductions to the operational status of nuclear weapons systems,
	Recognizing that the maintenance of nuclear weapons systems at a high level of readiness increases the risk of the unintentional or accidental use of such weapons, which would have catastrophic consequences,
	Recognizing also that reductions in deployments and the lowering of operational status contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as to the process of nuclear disarmament, through the enhancement of confidence-building and transparency measures and a diminishing role for nuclear weapons in security policies,
	Welcoming the steps taken by some States to enhance the environment to support further reductions in nuclear weapons, including de-targeting initiatives and increasing the amount of preparation time required for deployment, and in this connection welcoming the commitment made by the United States of America to maximize Presidential decision time and to consider other steps that may diminish further the possibility of nuclear launches resulting from accidents, unauthorized actions or misperceptions, 
	1.	Welcomes the adoption by consensus of the conclusions and recommendations for follow-on actions of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,1 including the commitments of the nuclear-weapon States to promptly engage with a view to, inter alia, considering the legitimate interest of non-nuclear-weapon States in further reducing the operational status of nuclear weapons systems in ways that promote international stability and security, and looks forward to the report of the nuclear-weapon States, in terms of that undertaking, to the Preparatory Committee for the Review Conference in 2014; 
	2.	Calls for further practical steps to be taken to decrease the operational readiness of nuclear weapons systems, with a view to ensuring that all nuclear weapons are removed from high alert status; 
	3.	Urges States to update the General Assembly on progress made in the implementation of the present resolution;
	4.	Decides to remain seized of the matter.

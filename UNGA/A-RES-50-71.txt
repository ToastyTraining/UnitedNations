	E


Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons

	The General Assembly,

	Convinced that the use of nuclear weapons poses the most serious threat to the survival of mankind,

	Convinced also that a multilateral agreement prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would strengthen international security and contribute to the climate for negotiations leading to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons,

	Conscious that some steps taken by the Russian Federation and the United States of America towards a reduction of their nuclear weapons and the improvement in the international climate can contribute towards the goal of complete elimination of nuclear weapons,

	Recalling that, in paragraph 58 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly, 1/ it is stated that all States should actively participate in efforts to bring about conditions in international relations among States in which a code of peaceful conduct of nations in international affairs could be agreed upon and that would preclude the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,

	Stressing that an international convention would be an important step in a phased programme towards the complete elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework,

	Noting with regret that the Conference on Disarmament, during its 1995 session, was unable to undertake negotiations on this subject,

	1.	Reiterates its request to the Conference on Disarmament to commence negotiations, in order to reach agreement on an international convention prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances, taking as a possible basis the draft Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons annexed to the present resolution;

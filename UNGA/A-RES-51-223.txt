51/223.Israeli settlement activities in the occupied Palestinian territory, in particular in occupied East Jerusalem


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the letters dated 21,1 252 and 273 February 1997 from the Permanent Observer of Palestine on behalf of the States members of the League of Arab States,

	Expressing deep concern at the decision of the Government of Israel to initiate new settlement activities in the Jebel Abu Ghneim area in East Jerusalem,

	Expressing concern about other recent measures that encourage or facilitate new settlement activities,


	Stressing that such settlements are illegal and a major obstacle to peace,

	Recalling its resolutions on Jerusalem and other relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions,

	Confirming that all legislative and administrative measures and actions taken by Israel which purport to alter the status of Jerusalem, including expropriation of land and properties thereon, are invalid and cannot change that status,

	Reaffirming its support for the Middle East peace process and all its achievements, including the recent agreement on Hebron,

	Concerned about the difficulties facing the Middle East peace process, including the impact these have on the living conditions of the Palestinian people, and urging the parties to fulfil their obligations, including under the agreements already reached,

	Having discussed the situation at its 91st, 92nd and 93rd plenary meetings on 12 and 13 March 1997,

	1.	Calls upon the Israeli authorities to refrain from all actions or measures, including settlement activities, which alter the facts on the ground, pre-empting the final status negotiations, and have negative implications for the Middle East peace process;

	2.	Calls upon Israel, the occupying Power, to abide scrupulously by its legal obligations and responsibilities under the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War of 12 August 1949,4 which is applicable to all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967;

	3.	Calls upon all parties to continue, in the interests of peace and security, their negotiations within the Middle East peace process on its agreed basis and the timely implementation of the agreements reached;

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to bring to the attention of the Government of Israel the provisions of the present resolution.

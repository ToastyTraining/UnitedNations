	Recognizing that older women outnumber older men, increasingly so with increasing age, and that the situation of older women everywhere must be a priority for policy action,
	Aware that in order to ensure full equality between women and men it is essential to recognize the differential impact of ageing on women and men and to integrate a gender perspective into all policies, programmes and legislation,

	Aware that few statistics are available on the situation of older women, and recognizing the importance of data, including data disaggregated by age and sex, as an essential element of planning and policy evaluations,
	Recognizing that women of all ages, in particular older women, continue to suffer from discrimination and lack of opportunities, including educational opportunities,
	Emphasizing that Governments bear the primary responsibility for creating an enabling environment for the economic and social development of their citizens, and noting with appreciation the valuable contributions of civil society, including non-governmental organizations, in calling attention to the specific needs of older women,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Second World Assembly on Ageing, held at Madrid from 8 to 12 April 2002,4 and the report of the Secretary-General on the follow-up to the Second World Assembly on Ageing,5 and calls for efforts to implement the global action plan aimed at meeting the challenges of the world's ageing population, in particular with regard to older women;
	2.	Stresses the importance of mainstreaming a gender perspective, while continuing to take into account the needs of older women, in policy and planning processes at all levels;

	4.	Urges Governments and regional and international organizations, including the United Nations system in cooperation with civil society, including non-governmental organizations, where appropriate, to promote programmes for healthy active ageing that stress the independence, equality, participation and security of older women and to undertake gender-specific research and programmes to address their needs;
	5.	Emphasizes the need for Governments and regional and international organizations, including the United Nations system and the international financial institutions, to develop and improve the collection, analysis and dissemination of data disaggregated by age and sex;
	6.	Welcomes the adoption in April 2002 by the Valencia Forum of research and academic professionals of the Research Agenda on Ageing for the Twenty-First Century, to support the implementation of the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing, 2002;4

Urges Governments to take measures to enable all older women to be actively engaged in all aspects of life by assuming a variety of roles in communities, public life and decision-making, and to develop and implement policies and programmes in cooperation with civil society, including non-governmental organizations, where appropriate, to ensure that older women can achieve their full enjoyment of human rights and quality of life, with a view to contributing to the realization of a society for all ages;
	8.	Calls upon Governments and the United Nations system to ensure that the needs, perspectives and experiences of older women are reflected in all development policies and programmes;

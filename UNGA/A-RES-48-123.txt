	Recalling also that one of the purposes of the United Nations, as set forth in the Charter, is to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion,

	Emphasizing the significance and validity of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1/ and of the International Covenants on Human Rights 2/ in promoting respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms,

	1/	Resolution 217 A (III).

	2/	Resolution 2200 A (XXI), annex.



	Recalling its resolution 32/130 of 16 December 1977, in which it decided that the approach to future work within the United Nations system with respect to human rights questions should take into account the concepts set forth in that resolution,

	Noting with concern that many of the principles enunciated in resolution 32/130 have not yet been taken into consideration by the international community with all the necessary dynamism and objectivity,

	Emphasizing the special importance of the purposes and principles proclaimed in the Declaration on the Right to Development, contained in the annex to its resolution 41/128 of 4 December 1986,

	Reaffirming that the implementation of the right to development is an indispensable element in the process of creating the appropriate conditions for the full enjoyment and preservation of all human rights and fundamental liberties,

	Reiterating that the right to development is an inalienable human right and that equality of development opportunities is a prerogative both of nations and of individuals within nations,

	Expressing its particular concern about the progressive worsening of living conditions in the developing world and the negative impact thereof on the full enjoyment of human rights, and especially about the very serious economic situation of the African continent and the disastrous effects of the heavy burden of the external debt for the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America,

	Reiterating its profound conviction that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interdependent and that equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation, promotion and protection of civil and political rights and of economic, social and cultural rights,

	Deeply convinced that, today more than ever, economic and social development and human rights are complementary elements leading to the same goal, that is, the maintenance of peace and justice among nations as the foundation for the ideals of freedom and well-being to which mankind aspires,

	Reiterating that cooperation among all nations on the basis of respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of each State, including the right of every people to choose freely its own socio-economic and political system, is essential for the promotion of peace and development,


__________

	3/	See A/47/675-S/24816.



	Reiterating also that, in order to ensure the full implementation of the right to development, international cooperation should be conducive to an improvement of relations among States as well as to  the commitment of States to refrain from conditioning their economic assistance to developing countries,

	Considering that the efforts of the developing countries to promote their own development should be supported by an increased flow of resources and by the adoption of appropriate and substantive measures for creating an external environment conducive to such development,

	1.	Reiterates its request that the Commission on Human Rights should continue its current work on overall analysis with a view to further promoting and strengthening human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the question of the programme and working methods of the Commission, and on the overall analysis of the alternative approaches and ways and means for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the provisions and ideas set forth in General Assembly resolution 32/130;

	2.	Affirms that a primary aim of international cooperation in the field of human rights is a life of freedom, dignity and peace for all peoples and for every human being, that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are indivisible and interrelated and that the promotion and protection of one category of rights should never exempt or excuse States from promoting and protecting the others;

	3.	Reaffirms that equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the implementation, promotion and protection of civil and political rights and of economic, social and cultural rights;

	4.	Reiterates once again that the international community should accord, or continue to accord, priority to the search for solutions to mass and flagrant violations of human rights of peoples and individuals affected by situations such as those mentioned in paragraph 1 (e) of General Assembly resolution 32/130, paying due attention also to other situations of violations of human rights;

	5.	Notes that the questions mentioned in paragraph 4 above were discussed during the World Conference on Human Rights held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993 and are referred to in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action 4/ as obstacles still prevailing to the achievement of further progress in the field of human rights;

	6.	Reaffirms that the right to development is an inalienable human right;

	7.	Reaffirms also that international peace and security are essential elements for achieving the full realization of the right to development;

	12.	Decides that the approaches to future work within the United Nations system on human rights matters should take into account the content of the Declaration on the Right to Development and the need for the implementation thereof;


	13.	Decides to consider this question at its forty-ninth session.

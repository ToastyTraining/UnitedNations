	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/52/843)]


52/228.Financing of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 690 (1991) of 29 April 1991, by which the Council decided to establish the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, and the subsequent resolutions in which the Council extended the mandate of the Mission, the latest of which was resolution 1133 (1997) of 20 October 1997,

	Recalling its resolution 45/266 of 17 May 1991 on the financing of the Mission and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 51/2 B of 13 June 1997,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,


	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	Concerned that the Secretary-General continues to face difficulties in meeting the obligations of the Mission on a current basis, including reimbursement to current and former troop-contributing States,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara as at 20 March 1998, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 54,513,290 United States dollars, representing 19 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Mission to the period ending 20 April 1998, notes that some 12 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

	4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Mission in full and on time;

	5.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2 and notes that paragraph 7 of that report is neither an observation nor a recommendation;

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

	7.	Also requests the Secretary-General, in order to reduce the cost of employing General Service staff, to continue efforts to employ locally recruited staff for the Mission against General Service posts, commensurate with the operational requirements of such posts;

	8.	Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara the amount of 17,172,300 dollars gross (15,989,300 dollars net) for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998, inclusive of the amount of 9,300,500 dollars gross (8,478,100 dollars net) already authorized, with the concurrence of the Advisory Committee, for the period from 1 November 1997 to 31 March 1998 under the terms of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994 and in addition to the amount of 30,229,800 dollars gross (28,430,400 dollars net) already appropriated for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998 under the provisions of Assembly resolution 51/2 B;

	9.	Decides also, as an ad hoc arrangement, to apportion the additional amount of 11,077,300 dollars gross (10,309,500 dollars net) for the period ending 20 April 1998 among Member States, taking into account the amount of 24,351,780 dollars gross (22,902,270 dollars net) already assessed for the same period under the terms of General Assembly resolution 51/2 B, in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996, 51/218 A to C of 18 December 1996 and 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and 50/451 B of 23 December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the year 1997, as set out in its resolution 49/19 B of 23 December 1994 and its decision 50/471 A of 23 December 1995, and the scale of assessments for the year 1998, as set out in its resolution 52/215 A of 22 December 1997;

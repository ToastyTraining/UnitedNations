Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 19 December 2016
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/71/484/Add.2)]
71/199.	The right to privacy in the digital age


	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
	Reaffirming also the human rights and fundamental freedoms enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 and relevant international human rights treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights2 and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,2
	Reaffirming further the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,3 
	Recalling General Assembly resolutions 68/167 of 18 December 2013 and 69/166 of 18 December 2014, as well as Human Rights Council resolutions 28/16 of 26 March 2015 on the right to privacy in the digital age4 and 32/13 of 1 July 2016 on the promotion, protection and enjoyment of human rights on the Internet,5 and welcoming the appointment of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the right to privacy,
	Welcoming the outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the overall review of the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society,6 
	Taking note of the reports of the Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy7 and the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression,8 
	Welcoming the work of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the right to privacy in the digital age, noting with interest its report thereon,9 and recalling the panel discussion on the right to privacy in the digital age held during the twenty-seventh session of the Human Rights Council,
	Noting that the rapid pace of technological development enables individuals all over the world to use new information and communications technologies and at the same time enhances the capacity of governments, companies and individuals to undertake surveillance, interception and data collection, which may violate or abuse human rights, in particular the right to privacy, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and is therefore an issue of increasing concern,
	Noting also that violations and abuses of the right to privacy in the digital age may affect all individuals, including with particular effects on women, as well as children and those who are vulnerable or marginalized,
	Reaffirming the human right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, and recognizing that the exercise of the right to privacy is important for the realization of the right to freedom of expression and to hold opinions without interference and the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association, and is one of the foundations of a democratic society, 
	Noting with appreciation general comment No. 16 of the Human Rights Committee on article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, on the right to respect of privacy, family, home and correspondence, and protection of honour and reputation,10 while also noting the vast technological leaps that have taken place since its adoption and the need to discuss the right to privacy in view of the challenges of the digital age,
	Recognizing the need to further discuss and analyse, based on international human rights law, issues relating to the promotion and protection of the right to privacy in the digital age, procedural safeguards, effective domestic oversight and remedies, the impact of surveillance on the right to privacy and other human rights, as well as the need to examine the principles of non-arbitrariness and lawfulness, and the relevance of necessity and proportionality assessments in relation to surveillance practices,
	Noting the holding of the Global Multi-stakeholder Meeting on the Future of Internet Governance (NETmundial) and the multi-stakeholder discussions that take place annually in the Internet Governance Forum, which is a multi-stakeholder forum for discussions of Internet governance issues and whose mandate was extended by the General Assembly in 2015 for another 10 years,6 and recognizing that effectively addressing the challenges relating to the right to privacy in the context of modern communications technology requires an ongoing, concerted multi-stakeholder engagement,
	Affirming that this engagement is greatly facilitated by informal dialogues about the right to privacy among all relevant stakeholders,
	Recognizing that the discussion on the right to privacy should be based upon existing international and domestic legal obligations, including international human rights law, as well as relevant commitments, and should not open the path for undue interference with an individual's human rights, 
	Stressing the importance of full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information, including the fundamental importance of access to information and democratic participation,
	Recalling that the right to privacy is important for the exercise of freedom of expression, including the right to seek, receive and impart information, and contributes to the development of an individual's ability to participate in political, economic, social and cultural life and that digital technology has a considerable impact on the enjoyment of these rights,
	Noting that, while metadata can provide benefits, certain types of metadata, when aggregated, can reveal personal information and can give an insight into an individual's behaviour, social relationships, private preferences and identity,
	Expressing concern that individuals often do not provide their free, explicit and informed consent to the sale or multiple resale of their personal data, as the collecting, processing and sharing of personal data, including sensitive data, have increased significantly in the digital age,
	Emphasizing that unlawful or arbitrary surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the unlawful or arbitrary collection of personal data, as highly intrusive acts, violate the right to privacy, can interfere with the right to freedom of expression and may contradict the tenets of a democratic society, including when undertaken on a mass scale,
	Recognizing that the same rights that people have offline must also be protected online, including the right to privacy,
	Noting in particular that surveillance of digital communications must be consistent with international human rights obligations and must be conducted on the basis of a legal framework, which must be publicly accessible, clear, precise, comprehensive and non-discriminatory, and that any interference with the right to privacy must not be arbitrary or unlawful, bearing in mind what is reasonable to the pursuance of legitimate aims, and recalling that States that are parties to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights must undertake the necessary steps to adopt laws or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognized in the Covenant,
	Emphasizing that States must respect international human rights obligations regarding the right to privacy when they intercept digital communications of individuals and/or collect personal data and when they require disclosure of personal data from third parties, including private companies,
	Recognizing the global and open nature of the Internet as a driving force in accelerating progress towards development in its various forms, including in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals,11 
	Noting that general comment No. 16 recommends that States take effective measures to prevent the unlawful retention, processing and use of personal data stored by public authorities and business enterprises,
	Noting also that the increasing capabilities of business enterprises to collect, process and use personal data can pose a risk to the enjoyment of the right to privacy in the digital age,
	Welcoming measures taken by business enterprises, on a voluntary basis, to provide transparency to their users about their policies regarding requests by State authorities for access to user data and information,
	Recalling that business enterprises have a responsibility to respect human rights, applicable laws, international principles and standards, 
	Deeply concerned at the negative impact that surveillance and/or interception of communications, including extraterritorial surveillance and/or interception of communications, as well as the collection of personal data, in particular when carried out on a mass scale, may have on the exercise and enjoyment of human rights,
	Noting with deep concern that, in many countries, persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms frequently face threats and harassment and suffer insecurity as well as unlawful or arbitrary interference with their right to privacy as a result of their activities,
	Noting that, while concerns about public security may justify the gathering and protection of certain sensitive information, States must ensure full compliance with their obligations under international human rights law,
	Noting also, in that respect, that the prevention and suppression of terrorism is a public interest of great importance, while reaffirming that States must ensure that any measures taken to combat terrorism are in compliance with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law,
	Recognizing that an open, secure, stable, accessible and peaceful information and communications technology environment is important to the realization of the right to privacy in the digital age, 
	1.	Reaffirms the right to privacy, according to which no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his or her privacy, family, home or correspondence, and the right to the protection of the law against such interference, as set out in article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 and article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;2

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 15 April 2016
[without reference to a Main Committee (A/70/L.44 and Add.1)]
70/260.	Improving global road safety


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 57/309 of 22 May 2003, 58/9 of 5 November 2003, 58/289 of 14 April 2004, 60/5 of 26 October 2005, 62/244 of 31 March 2008, 64/255 of 2 March 2010, 66/260 of 19 April 2012 and 68/269 of 10 April 2014 on improving global road safety, 
	Having considered the note by the Secretary-General transmitting the report on improving global road safety1 and the recommendations contained therein,
	Reaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development", in which it adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for the full implementation of this Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental - in a balanced and integrated manner, and to building upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking to address their unfinished business, 
	Reaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports and complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with concrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to address the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels for sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity, 
	Recalling that the Sustainable Development Goals and targets are integrated and indivisible and balance the three dimensions of sustainable development, and acknowledging the importance of reaching the road safety-related targets, such as target 3.6, which aims to halve, by 2020, the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents, and target 11.2, which aims to provide, by 2030, access to safe, affordable, accessible and sustainable transport systems for all, improving road safety, notably by expanding public transport, with special attention to the needs of those in vulnerable situations, women, children, persons with disabilities and older persons,
	Noting that, at the midpoint of the Decade of Action for Road Safety 2011-2020, the overwhelming majority of road traffic deaths and injuries are predictable and preventable and that, despite some improvements in many countries, including in developing countries, they remain a major public health and development problem that has broad social and economic consequences which, if unaddressed, may affect progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals,
	Recognizing that human suffering, combined with costs to countries of 3 to 5 per cent of their gross domestic product a year, makes reducing road traffic deaths and injuries an urgent development priority, and that investment in road safety has a positive impact on public health and the economy,
	Taking into account that road traffic deaths and injuries are also a social equity issue, as the poor and the vulnerable are most frequently also vulnerable road users, namely, pedestrians, cyclists, users of motorized two- and three-wheeled vehicles and passengers of unsafe public transport, who are disproportionately affected and exposed to risks and road crashes, which can lead to a cycle of poverty exacerbated by income loss, and recalling that the aim of road safety policies should be to guarantee protection to all users,
	Recognizing that road safety requires addressing broader issues of equitable access to mobility and that the promotion of sustainable modes of transport, in particular safe public transport and safe walking and cycling, is a key element of road safety, 
	Taking into account the importance of strengthening institutional capacity and continuing international cooperation, including South-South and triangular cooperation, cooperation between countries that share roads across borders and cooperation among regional and international organizations, to further support efforts to improve road safety, particularly in developing countries, and providing, as appropriate, support to meet the goals of the Decade of Action and those of the 2030 Agenda, 
	Emphasizing that, while each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development, and that the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized in the context of reaching the Sustainable Development Goals, international public finance plays an important role in complementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited domestic resources, 
	Expressing its concern that, despite the stabilization of the global number of road traffic fatalities since 2013, the number of road traffic crashes remains unacceptably high, and crashes represent a leading cause of death and injury around the world, killing more than 1.25 million people and injuring as many as 50 million people a year, with 90 per cent of these casualties occurring in developing countries, and concerned also that road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death around the world for children and young people between 15 and 29 years of age,
	Acknowledging the leading role of Oman and the Russian Federation in drawing the attention of the international community to the global road safety crisis, 
	Commending the Government of the Russian Federation for hosting the first Global Ministerial Conference on Road Safety, in Moscow on 19 and 20 November 2009, which culminated in the Moscow Declaration,2 and the Government of Brazil for hosting the second Global High-level Conference on Road Safety, in Brasilia on 18 and 19 November 2015, which culminated in the Brasilia Declaration, and Oman for its role in preparing the first United Nations Global Road Safety Week, held from 23 to 29 April 2007, during the sixth meeting of the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration, held in Muscat on 27 and 28 February 2007, 
	Commending Member States that have adopted comprehensive legislation on key risk factors, including the non-use of seat belts, child restraints and helmets, drinking alcohol and driving, and speeding, and drawing attention to other risk factors such as visibility, medical conditions and medicines which affect safe driving, fatigue and the use of narcotic and psychotropic drugs and psychoactive substances, mobile phones and other electronic and texting devices, 
	Recognizing the progress made by some Member States in providing universal access to health care in the pre-hospital, hospital and post-hospital and rehabilitation and reintegration phases to road traffic crash victims and their families, 
	Encouraging Member States to promote multi-stakeholder partnerships to address the safety of vulnerable road users, the delivery of first aid to victims of road accidents or crashes, training and education, notably in developing and least developed countries, 
	Acknowledging the work of the United Nations system, in particular the leadership of the World Health Organization, in close cooperation with the United Nations regional commissions, in establishing, implementing and monitoring various aspects of the Global Plan for the Decade of Action for Road Safety (2011-2020), and the commitment of the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), the United Nations Environment Programme, the United Nations Children's Fund and the International Labour Organization, among other entities, to supporting those efforts as well as that of the World Bank and regional development banks to implementing road safety projects and programmes, in particular in developing countries, 
	Commending the World Health Organization for its leadership role in preventing road traffic injury and for its role in implementing the mandate conferred upon it by the General Assembly to act, in close cooperation with the United Nations regional commissions, as a coordinator on road safety issues within the United Nations system3 and in preparing and launching the Global Status Report on Road Safety 2015, the third in a series of reports to monitor progress over the period of the Decade of Action, as requested in Assembly resolution 62/244, and the 180 Member States that took part in the survey,
	Commending also the United Nations regional commissions for their work in increasing road safety activities and advocating increased political commitment to road safety, and in working towards setting regional and national road traffic casualty reduction targets, in particular the work of the Economic Commission for Europe in elaborating global road safety-related legal instruments, including international conventions and agreements, technical standards, resolutions and good practice recommendations, as well as in servicing 58 global and regional legal instruments that provide a commonly accepted legal and technical framework for the development of international road, rail, inland water and combined transport, 
	Emphasizing the role of the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration as a consultative mechanism to facilitate international road safety cooperation,
	Noting the work of two Economic Commission for Europe groups of experts, namely, on road signs and signals and on improving safety at level crossings, and recognizing the continuous work of the World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations to modify vehicle regulations to increase safety performance,
	Noting with approval the Economic Commission for Europe project, in collaboration with the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Economic Commission for Africa, under the United Nations Development Account, to strengthen the national road safety management capacity of selected countries, 
	Taking note of the United Nations regional commissions study entitled "Transport for sustainable development: the case of inland transport", conducted in cooperation with the International Road Transport Union and the International Union of Railways, which gives a fair picture of the road safety situation on five continents, shares best practices and identifies not only the road safety challenges, but also their solutions, 
	Taking note also of the International Maritime Organization/International Labour Organization/Economic Commission for Europe Code of Practice for Packing of Cargo Transport Units, which took effect in 2015 and is intended to increase safety in the handling of containers and reduce the number of incidents across transport modes attributed to poor practices in the packing of cargo, 
	Acknowledging a number of other important international efforts on road safety, including the development by the International Road Transport Union of harmonized and internationally recognized standards for the vocational training of road transport professionals, as well as the development of an updated Road Safety Manual by the World Road Association to offer guidance to officials at various levels on measures that can enhance the safety of road infrastructure, 
	Welcoming the establishment of the High-level Advisory Group on Sustainable Transport and the appointment of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Road Safety, with secretariat support from the Economic Commission for Europe, as an efficient tool for mobilizing sustained political commitment to road safety by advocating adherence to and raising awareness about the United Nations legal instruments on road safety, sharing good practices through participation in global and regional conferences and generating funds for road safety, 
	Recognizing the commitment of States and civil society to road safety by their participation in United Nations Global Road Safety Week, including during the third Week, held from 4 to 10 May 2015, which highlighted the plight of children on the world's roads to generate action to better ensure their safety, including the Child Declaration for Road Safety,
	Recognizing also Member States and civil society for their continued commitment to road safety by their observance of the World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims on the third Sunday of November every year,
	Recognizing further that providing basic conditions and services to address road safety is primarily a responsibility of Governments, while recognizing nonetheless that there is a shared responsibility to move towards a world free from road traffic fatalities and serious injuries and that addressing road safety demands multi-stakeholder collaboration among the public and private sectors, academia, professional organizations, non-governmental organizations and the media,

Recall that the aim of this commemoration is to mobilize political will at the national, regional and international levels, and reaffirm our political commitment to the full and effective implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and the outcome document of the Durban Review Conference, and their follow-up processes, at all these levels;
	3.	Welcome the progress made in many parts of the world in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance since 2001;
	4.	Acknowledge that, in spite of concerted efforts by the international community in the past ten years, building on efforts of the past decades, the scourge of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, including their new forms and manifestations, still persists in all parts of the world and that countless human beings continue to the present day to be victims of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance; 
	5.	Reaffirm that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance constitute a negation of the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights3 and that equality and non-discrimination are fundamental principles of international law;

Call upon the United Nations system and international and regional organizations and invite all stakeholders, including parliaments, civil society and the private sector, to fully commit themselves and to intensify their efforts in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and welcome the continued engagement of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in incorporating the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action into the United Nations system;
	12.	Proclaim together our strong determination to make the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and the protection of the victims thereof, a high priority for our countries.

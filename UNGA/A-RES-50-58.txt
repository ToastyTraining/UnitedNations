Reiterates its appeal to all States to contribute generously to the Trust Fund for Liberia established by the Secretary-General, inter alia, to assist the Economic Community of West African States Monitoring Group to fulfil its mandate and to provide assistance for the reconstruction of Liberia;

	(a)	To continue his efforts to mobilize all possible assistance within the United Nations system to help the Government of Liberia in its reconstruction and development efforts;

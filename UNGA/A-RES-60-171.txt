	(d)	To abolish public executions and other executions carried out in the absence of respect for internationally recognized safeguards, in particular, as called for by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in its report of January 2005,8 executions of persons who, at the time of their offence, were under the age of 18, and to uphold the moratorium on executions by stoning and to introduce this moratorium as law as a first step towards the abolition of this punishment;

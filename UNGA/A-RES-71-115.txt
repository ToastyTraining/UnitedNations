[on the report of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee
(Fourth Committee) (A/71/502)] 
71/115.	Question of Pitcairn 


	The General Assembly, 
	Having considered the question of Pitcairn, 
	Having examined the relevant chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2016, related to Pitcairn,1 
	Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on Pitcairn2 and other relevant information, 
	Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people of Pitcairn and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly, 
	Expressing concern that 56 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,3 there still remain 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Pitcairn, 
	Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second4 and Third International Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism, 
	Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of Pitcairn require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, size of population or natural resources, 
	Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should continue to guide the development of their future political status and that referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people, 
	Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the Territories as tax havens to the detriment of the world economy and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers
that are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 1514 (XV), 
	Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views of the people of Pitcairn in respect of their right to self-determination should be ascertained, 
	Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional organizations, 
	Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding of the political status of the people of Pitcairn and to fulfil its mandate effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the administering Power and to receive information from other appropriate sources, including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory, 
	Aware of the importance both to Pitcairn and to the Special Committee of the participation of elected and appointed representatives of Pitcairn in the work of the Committee, 
	Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at assisting the people of Pitcairn with their inalienable right to self-determination and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self-determination, on a case-by-case basis, 
	Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of the Territories, 
	Welcoming the Pacific regional seminar held by the Special Committee in Managua and hosted by the Government of Nicaragua from 31 May to 2 June 2016 as a significant and forward-looking event, which enabled the participants to assess the progress made in the decolonization process and to review the existing working methods of the Committee and renew its momentum in implementing its historic task, 
	Recognizing the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee5 and which outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General Assembly of the period 2011-2020 as the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism,6 
	Taking into account the unique character of Pitcairn in terms of population, area and access, 
	Aware that the administering Power and the territorial Government have implemented a governance structure to strengthen administrative capacity in the Territory, based on consultations with the people of the Territory, and that Pitcairn continues to receive budgetary aid from the administering Power for the operation of the territorial Government, 
	Cognizant that the administering Power and the territorial Government have developed a five-year strategic development plan, covering the period from 2012 to 2016, that sets out the views and aspirations of the people of the Territory for the socioeconomic development of the Territory, 
	Aware of the assessment made in 2013 that the population of the Territory needs to be boosted if the Territory is to have a sustainable future and of the approval by the Pitcairn Island Council of an immigration policy and the repopulation plan, covering the period from 2014 to 2019, designed to promote immigration and repopulation and bring people with the necessary skills and commitment to Pitcairn, 
	Noting with concern the findings contained in the final report on the survey commissioned by the Pitcairn Island Council to ascertain whether members of the diaspora had any interest in returning to the Territory and the factors conditioning a decision, 
	1.	Reaffirms the inalienable right of the people of Pitcairn to self-determination, in conformity with the Charter of the United Nations and with General Assembly resolution 1514 (XV), containing the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples;

	6.	Also requests the administering Power to continue its assistance for the improvement of the economic, social, educational and other conditions of the population of the Territory and to continue its discussions with the territorial Government on how best to support socioeconomic and environmental security in Pitcairn, including as regards demographic matters; 
	7.	Welcomes the work carried out on the preparation of the five-year strategic development plan for the island; 
	8.	Stresses the importance of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples being apprised of the views and wishes of the people of Pitcairn and enhancing its understanding of their conditions, including the nature and scope of the existing political and constitutional arrangements between Pitcairn and the administering Power; 
	9.	Calls upon the administering Power to participate in and cooperate fully with the work of the Special Committee in order to implement the provisions of Article 73 e of the Charter and the Declaration and in order to advise the Committee on the implementation of the provisions under Article 73 b of the Charter on efforts to promote self-government in Pitcairn, and encourages the administering Power to facilitate visiting and special missions to the Territory;

	12.	Requests the Territory and the administering Power to take all measures necessary to protect and conserve the environment of the Territory against any degradation, and once again requests the specialized agencies concerned to monitor environmental conditions in the Territory and to provide assistance to the Territory, consistent with their prevailing rules of procedure;

	Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General on disarmament and non-proliferation education,1 in which the Secretary-General reported on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the United Nations study on disarmament and non-proliferation education,2
	Recognizing the usefulness of the disarmament and non-proliferation education website, "Disarmament Education: Resources for Learning",3 welcoming the launch on the site of the publication Disarmament: A Basic Guide by the Office for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat, and encouraging the continuous updating of the educational disarmament and non-proliferation content on the United Nations CyberSchoolBus website,4 launched by the Department of Public Information of the Secretariat and the Office for Disarmament Affairs,
	Emphasizing that the Secretary-General concludes in his report that efforts need to be continued to implement the recommendations of the study and follow the good examples of how they are being implemented to stimulate even further long-term results,
	Desirous of stressing the urgency of promoting concerted international efforts at disarmament and non-proliferation, in particular in the field of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, with a view to strengthening international security and enhancing sustainable economic and social development,
	Conscious of the need to combat the negative effects of cultures of violence and complacency in the face of current dangers in this field through long-term programmes of education and training,
	Remaining convinced that the need for disarmament and non-proliferation education has never been greater, not only on the subject of weapons of mass destruction but also in the field of small arms and light weapons, terrorism and other challenges to international security and the process of disarmament, as well as on the relevance of implementing the recommendations contained in the United Nations study,
	Recognizing the importance of encouraging civil society, including non-governmental organizations, to play a more active role in the promotion of disarmament and non-proliferation education,
	1.	Expresses its appreciation to the Member States, the United Nations and other international and regional organizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, which, within their purview, implemented the recommendations made in the United Nations study,2 as discussed in the report of the Secretary-General reviewing the implementation of the recommendations,1 and encourages them once again to continue applying those recommendations and reporting to the Secretary-General on steps taken to implement them;
	2.	Requests the Secretary-General to prepare a report reviewing the results of the implementation of the recommendations and possible new opportunities for promoting disarmament and non-proliferation education, and to submit it to the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session;
	3.	Reiterates the request to the Secretary-General to utilize electronic means to the fullest extent possible in the dissemination, in as many official languages as feasible, of information related to that report and any other information that the Office for Disarmament Affairs gathers on an ongoing basis in regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the United Nations study;
	4.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-seventh session the item entitled "Disarmament and non-proliferation education".

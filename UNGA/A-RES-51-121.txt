	Concerned about the potentially harmful effects on present and future generations resulting from the levels of radiation to which mankind and the environment are exposed,

	Noting the views expressed by Member States at its fifty-first session with regard to the work of the Scientific Committee,

	Conscious of the continuing need to examine and compile information about atomic and ionizing radiation and to analyse its effects on mankind and the environment,


	1.	Commends the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation for the valuable contribution it has been making in the course of the past forty-one years, since its inception, to wider knowledge and understanding of the levels, effects and risks of atomic radiation, and for fulfilling its original mandate with scientific authority and independence of judgement;

	2.	Notes with satisfaction the completion in 1996 of a further scientific annex by the Scientific Committee informing the scientific and world communities of its latest evaluations of the sources and effects of ionizing radiation on man and his environment, and calls upon the Scientific Committee to ensure the widest possible dissemination of this scientific annex to Member States;

	3.	Requests the Scientific Committee to continue its work, including its important activities to increase knowledge of the levels, effects and risks of ionizing radiation from all sources;

	4.	Endorses the intentions and plans of the Scientific Committee for its future activities of scientific review and assessment on behalf of the General Assembly;

	8.	Invites Member States, the organizations of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations concerned to provide further relevant data about doses, effects and risks from various sources of radiation, which would greatly help in the preparation of future reports of the Scientific Committee to the General Assembly.

62/133.	Intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 61/143 of 19 December 2006,
	Reaffirming the obligation of all States to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, and reaffirming also that discrimination on the basis of sex is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women1 and other international human rights instruments, and that its elimination is an integral part of efforts towards the elimination of all forms of violence against women,
	Reaffirming also the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women,2 the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action,3 the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century",4 and the declaration adopted at the forty-ninth session of the Commission on the Status of Women,5

	Recognizing that women's poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of sustainable development, can place them at increased risk of violence, and that violence against women impedes the social and economic development of communities and States, as well as the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals,
	Deeply concerned about the pervasiveness of violence against women and girls in all its different forms and manifestations worldwide, and reiterating the need to intensify efforts to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls throughout the world,
	Stressing that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and punish the perpetrators of violence against women and girls, to eliminate impunity and to provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms,
	Expressing its appreciation for the high number of activities undertaken by the United Nations bodies, entities, funds and programmes and the specialized agencies to eliminate all forms of violence against women,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women, pursuant to resolution 61/143;7
	2.	Welcomes the decision of the Secretary-General to spearhead a multi-year system-wide campaign to eliminate violence against women and girls through 2015, focusing on global advocacy, United Nations leadership and strengthened efforts and partnerships at the national and regional levels;

	4.

	5.	Calls upon the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender Equality to intensify its consideration of ways and means to enhance the effectiveness of the United Nations Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women as a system-wide funding mechanism for preventing and redressing all forms of violence against women and girls;
	6.	Stresses that within the United Nations system adequate resources should be assigned to those bodies, specialized agencies, funds and programmes responsible for the promotion of gender equality and women's rights and to efforts throughout the United Nations system to eliminate violence against women and girls, supports the commitment of the Task Force on Violence against Women to undertake a resource flow analysis to assess the resources available for this work and elaborate recommendations for their most effective and efficient use, and calls upon the United Nations system to respond swiftly to those recommendations once issued;
	7.

	8.	Also requests the Secretary-General to present an oral report to the Commission on the Status of Women at its fifty-second session and thereafter to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session with information provided by the United Nations bodies, funds and programmes and the specialized agencies on recent follow-up activities to implement resolution 61/143 and the present resolution, including on the United Nations Trust Fund in Support of Actions to Eliminate Violence against Women, and urges United Nations bodies, entities, funds and programmes and the specialized agencies to contribute promptly to the report.

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/48/822/Add.1)]


48/244.Financing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force
in Cyprus

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 186 (1964) of 4 March 1964, by which the Council established the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus, and Council resolution 889 (1993) of 15 December 1993, by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force until 15 June 1994,

	Recalling its decision 48/474 of 23 December 1993 on the financing of the Force,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Force that are not covered by voluntary contributions are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling its previous decision regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	1/	A/48/846 and Corr.1.

	2/	A/48/907.
	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force by certain Governments,

	Noting that voluntary contributions were insufficient to cover all of the costs of the Force, including those incurred by troop-contributing Governments prior to 16 June 1993, and regretting the absence of an adequate response to appeals for voluntary contributions, including the one contained in the letter dated 12 November 1993 from the Secretary-General to all Member States, 3/

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Expresses concern about the adverse effect that the deteriorating financial situation has on reimbursement to troop contributors, placing an additional burden on those countries and putting at risk the continuing supply of troops to peace-keeping operations and, consequently, the effective implementation of their mandates;

	2.	Reaffirms its resolution 48/227 of 23 December 1993 and stresses the need for the Secretariat to submit budget documents in time in order to allow for a proper and thorough review and approval by the General Assembly of the budgets before their implementation;

	3.	Notes with satisfaction an improvement in the compliance by the Secretariat with certain resolutions of the General Assembly with regard to the form of budget documents concerning peace-keeping operations;

	4.	Reaffirms the importance of the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions as an advisory body to the General Assembly in the budget process;

	5.	Urges the Secretary-General to complete his review of the rates of reimbursement to Governments in respect of contingent-owned equipment in close consultation with Member States, in particular with troop-contributing countries, and to submit his proposals to the General Assembly no later than at its forty-ninth session;

	6.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee, 2/ subject to the provisions of the present resolution;

	7.	Takes note of the observations and recommendations contained in paragraph 12 of the report of the Advisory Committee on the costs relating to the emplacement and rotation of troops, and requests the Secretary-General to make recommendations in this respect, in the context of the reports requested in paragraph 3 of its resolution 47/218 B of 14 September 1993 and in section II, paragraph 3, of its resolution 48/228 A of 23 December 1993;

	8.	Requests the Secretary-General, in his next report on the financing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus, to include 
information, inter alia, on the implementation of paragraphs 15 and 17 of the report of the Advisory Committee;

	9.	Also requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Force is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy, and, in particular, to implement fully economy, financial and efficiency measures to be approved during the resumed forty-eighth session but no later than 1 May 1994, and to report on the implementation of such measures in the context of the performance report relevant to the period;

	10.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to the Force and urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Force promptly and in full;

	11.

	12.	Requests the Secretary-General to explore all possibilities in order to ensure prompt reimbursement to troop-contributing countries;

	13.	Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus, in accordance with the recommendations contained in paragraph 18 of the report of the Advisory Committee, a total amount of 10.5 million United States dollars gross (10,072,000 dollars net) for the Force for the period from 16 December 1993 to 15 June 1994;

	14.

20 December 1991 and 48/223 A of 23 December 1993 and Assembly decision 47/456 of 23 December 1992;

	15.	Decides further that, in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955, there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 14 above, their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated staff assessment income of 428,000 dollars approved for the Force for the period from 16 December 1993 to 15 June 1994;


	16.	Authorizes the Secretary-General, as an exceptional measure, to enter into commitments for the maintenance of the Force up to the amount of 3.8 million dollars gross (3,726,284 dollars net) per month, inclusive of the one-third share of the cost of the Force to be met through voluntary contributions from the Government of Cyprus and the annual pledge of 6.5 million dollars of the Government of Greece, for the period from 16 June to 15 December 1994, subject to the decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the Force beyond 15 June 1994, the amount of 11,950,000 dollars gross (11,507,700 dollars net) to be apportioned among Member States in accordance with the scheme set out in the present resolution;

	17.	Decides to continue to maintain as separate the account established prior to 16 June 1993 for the Force, invites Member States to make voluntary contributions to that account and, in this regard, requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts in appealing for voluntary contributions to this account;

	18.	Requests the Secretary-General, taking into account the voluntary nature of the financing of the Force prior to 16 June 1993, to report, in the context of the next budget performance report, on the status of the Special Account referred to in paragraph 17 above, and to include in that report possible solutions on how to improve reimbursements of the amounts owed to troop-contributing States for the period prior to 16 June 1993;

	19.	Invites voluntary contributions to the Force in cash and in the form of services and supplies acceptable to the Secretary-General, to be administered, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedure established by the General Assembly in its resolutions 43/230 of 21 December 1988, 44/192 A of 21 December 1989 and 45/258 of 3 May 1991;

	I.  PAYMENT OF THE BENEFIT

	Replace paragraph 23 with the following text:

  "23.   Where a beneficiary resides in a country other than the United States, the determination of the amount of the periodic benefit payable in a given month is as follows:

         "The dollar amount, as initially determined under subparagraph 5 (a) above and then adjusted under section H above, is converted to the local currency equivalent by using the exchange rate in effect for the month preceding the calendar quarter of that payment.  The resultant amount is compared with the local currency amount, as initially determined under subparagraph 5 (b) above and then adjusted under section H above.  Except as provided for in paragraph 25 below, the beneficiary is entitled, until the next quarter, to the greater of the local currency amount or the local currency equivalent of the dollar amount, subject to a maximum of:  (a) 120 per cent of the local currency amount with respect to benefits payable on account of separation or death in service before 1 July 1995 and other benefits derived therefrom; (b) 110 per cent of the local currency amount with respect to benefits payable on account of separation or death in service on or after 1 July 1995 and other benefits derived therefrom."

Annex
Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: On the Fast Track to Accelerating the Fight against HIV and to Ending the AIDS Epidemic by 2030
1.	We, Heads of State and Government and representatives of States and Governments assembled at the United Nations from 8 to 10 June 2016, reaffirm our commitment to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030 as our legacy to present and future generations, to accelerate and scale up the fight against HIV and end AIDS to reach this target, and to seize the new opportunities provided by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development1 to accelerate action and to recast our approach to AIDS given the potential of the Sustainable Development Goals to accelerate joined-up and sustainable efforts to lead to the end of the AIDS epidemic, and we pledge to intensify efforts towards the goal of comprehensive prevention, treatment, care and support programmes that will help to significantly reduce new infections, increase life expectancy and quality of life, and promote, protect and fulfil all human rights and the dignity of all people living with, at risk of and affected by HIV and AIDS and their families;
2.	Reaffirm the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS2 and the 2006 and 2011 political declarations on HIV and AIDS,3 and the urgent need to scale up significantly our efforts towards the goal of universal access to comprehensive prevention programmes, treatment, care and support;
3.	Reaffirm the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including the resolve of Member States to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030, and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development;4
4.	Reaffirm the sovereign rights of Member States, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and the need for all countries to implement the commitments and pledges in the present Declaration consistent with national laws, national development priorities and international human rights;
5.	Reaffirm the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,5 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,6 the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,6 the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action7 and the outcomes of its reviews, the outcome documents of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly,8 the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development,9 the key actions for its further implementation10 and the outcomes of its reviews, and note the outcome documents of the regional review conferences, stressing that the outcome documents of the regional review conferences provide region-specific guidance on population and development beyond 2014 for each region that adopted the particular outcome document, the Convention on the Rights of the Child,11 the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,12 the outcome document of the thirtieth special session of the General Assembly on the world drug problem,13 the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women14 and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities;15
6.	Recall Economic and Social Council resolution 2015/2 of 8 April 2015 on the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, in which the Council reaffirmed the value of the lessons learned from the global AIDS response for the post-2015 development agenda, Security Council resolution 1983 (2011) of 7 June 2011 on the impact of the HIV epidemic in conflict and post-conflict situations, Commission on the Status of Women resolution 60/2 of 24 March 2016 on women, the girl child and HIV and AIDS16 and Human Rights Council resolutions 17/14 of 17 June 201117 on the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health in the context of development and access to medicines, 12/27 of 2 October 200918 and 16/28 of 25 March 201119 on the protection of human rights in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), and 12/24 of 2 October 200918 on access to medicine in the context of the right of everyone to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health;
7.	Reaffirm that the promotion and protection of, and respect for, the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all, including the right to development, which are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, should be mainstreamed into all HIV and AIDS policies and programmes, and also reaffirm the need to take measures to ensure that every person is entitled to participate in, contribute to and enjoy economic, social, cultural and political development and that equal attention and urgent consideration should be given to the promotion, protection and fulfilment of all human rights;
8.	Underscore the importance of enhanced international cooperation to support the efforts of Member States to achieve health goals, including the target of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030, implement universal access to health-care services and address health challenges;
9.	Recognize that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, including full respect for international law. It is grounded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international human rights treaties, the United Nations Millennium Declaration20 and the 2005 World Summit Outcome.21 It is informed by other instruments such as the Declaration on the Right to Development;22
10.	Recognize that HIV and AIDS continue to constitute a global emergency, pose one of the most formidable challenges to the development, progress and stability of our respective societies and the world at large and require an exceptional and comprehensive global response that takes into account the fact that the spread of HIV is often a cause and a consequence of poverty and inequality, and that effective HIV and AIDS responses are critical to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental - in which it is recognized that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, that the dignity of the human person is fundamental and that the Sustainable Development Goals and targets should be met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society, so that no one will be left behind, thereby generating multiplier effects and a virtuous cycle of progress across the 2030 Agenda, bearing in mind the universal, integrated and indivisible nature of the Agenda;
11.	Call for urgent action over the next five years to ensure that no one is left behind in the AIDS response, that the returns on the unprecedented gains and investments made over the past decades are fully realized and that efforts are intensified, including through global solidarity, shared responsibility and political leadership, particularly given the rising population of people under the age of 25 in many high-burden countries, to avoid the risk of a rebound of the epidemic in some parts of the world and to tackle the growing rates of antimicrobial resistance which would result in increased human and economic loss, and express grave concern about the cost of inaction in the face of a looming crisis in access to and availability of treatment and inadequate progress and resources in comprehensive prevention, treatment, care and support;
12.	Reiterate that health is a precondition for and an outcome and indicator of all three dimensions of sustainable development, and that sustainable development can be achieved only in the absence of a high prevalence of debilitating communicable and non-communicable diseases, including emerging and re-emerging diseases;
13.	Recognize that poverty and poor health are inextricably linked and that poverty can increase the risk of progression from HIV to AIDS owing to a lack of access to comprehensive treatment-related services and adequate nutrition and care services and to the inability to meet costs related to treatment services, including transportation;
14.	Emphasize the continued importance, particularly given the 2015 World Health Organization guidelines recommending that antiretroviral therapy be initiated for everyone living with HIV at any CD4 cell count, of a more integrated and systemic approach to addressing people's access to quality, people-centred health-care services in a more holistic manner, in the context of promoting the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and well-being, universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights in accordance with the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development and the Beijing Platform for Action and the outcome documents of their review conferences, universal health coverage, social protection for people in vulnerable situations, strengthening of local, national and international health and social protection systems, including community systems, integrated responses to address non-communicable diseases and HIV and AIDS, and preparedness to tackle emerging disease outbreaks, such as the Ebola and Zika virus disease outbreaks and those yet to be identified, and other health threats;
15.	Emphasize that, to guarantee the sustainability of HIV prevention, treatment, care and support services, information and education, which are mutually reinforcing, these should be integrated with national health systems and services to address co-infections and co-morbidities, in particular tuberculosis, substance use and mental disorders, as well as sexual and reproductive health-care services, including prevention, screening and treatment for viral hepatitis and cervical cancer, as well as other sexually transmitted infections, including human papillomavirus, and services to respond to sexual and gender-based violence while noting the particular vulnerability of women and girls to these co-infections and co-morbidities;
16.	Recognize that addressing the holistic needs and rights of people living with, at risk of and affected by HIV throughout their life course will require close collaboration with efforts to end poverty and hunger everywhere, improve food and nutrition security and access to free, non-discriminatory primary and secondary education, promote healthy lives and well-being, provide access to HIV-sensitive social protection for all, including for children, reduce inequalities within and among countries, achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, provide for decent work and economic empowerment and promote healthy cities, stable housing and just and inclusive societies for all;
17.	Recognize that there are multiple and diverse epidemics and that, in order to achieve the prevention targets and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS "90-90-90" treatment targets23 by 2020 and to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030, AIDS responses need to achieve greater efficiency and focus on evidence, the geographic locations and populations at higher risk of infection and on service delivery models, innovations and programmes that will deliver the greatest impact, and in this regard note the need for a coherent United Nations response to assist countries to tailor effective responses, taking into account national context, including in humanitarian emergencies in conflict and post-conflict situations;
18.	Reiterate with profound concern that Africa, in particular sub-Saharan Africa, remains the worst-affected region and that urgent and exceptional action is required at all levels to curb the devastating effects of this epidemic, particularly on women and adolescent girls, and recognize the renewed commitment of African Governments and regional institutions to scale up their own HIV and AIDS responses;
19.	Express deep concern that HIV and AIDS affect every region of the world and that the Caribbean continues to have the highest prevalence outside sub-Saharan Africa, while the number of new HIV infections is increasing in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, and note that 90 per cent of people newly infected with HIV live in just 35 countries;
20.	Welcome and encourage regional efforts to set ambitious targets and design and implement strategies on HIV and AIDS, and take note of the Arab AIDS Strategy (2014-2020), the African Union Road Map on Shared Responsibility and Global Solidarity for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Response in Africa (2012-2015), which was extended until 2020, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Regional Strategy on HIV/AIDS (2013-2017), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Declaration of Commitment: Getting to zero new HIV infections, zero discrimination, zero AIDS-related deaths, the Caribbean Regional Strategic Framework on HIV and AIDS 2014-2018, the agreement on cooperation of the Commonwealth of Independent States in addressing HIV infection, the Action Plan on HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries: 2014-2016, the Pacific Sexual Health and Well-Being Shared Agenda 2015-2019 and other relevant strategies;
21.	Emphasize that the meaningful involvement of people living with, at risk of and affected by HIV and populations at higher risk of HIV facilitates the achievement of more effective AIDS responses and that people living with, at risk of and affected by HIV should enjoy equally all human rights and enjoy equal participation in civil, political, social, economic and cultural life, without prejudice, stigma or discrimination of any kind;
22.	Commend subregional, regional and global financing institutions, including the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, for the vital role that they play in mobilizing funding for country and regional AIDS responses, including for civil society, and in improving the predictability of financing over the long term, including bilateral investments, including from the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, and welcome the support of donors, while noting that it falls short of the amounts needed to further accelerate progress towards front-loading investments to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030;
23.	Commend the work of the international innovative health tools and drug purchase facility, UNITAID, based on innovative sources of financing and focusing on accessibility, quality and price reductions of antiretroviral drugs, and welcome the broadening of the scope of work of the Medicines Patent Pool, hosted by UNITAID, to promote voluntary partnerships to address hepatitis C and tuberculosis, reflecting the importance of integrating the AIDS response into the broader global health agenda;
24.	Take note of the Secretary-General's new Global Strategy for Women's, Children's and Adolescents' Health (2016-2030), which continues to galvanize global efforts to significantly reduce the number of maternal, adolescent, newborn and under-5 child deaths, as a matter of urgent concern;
25.	Note with appreciation the efforts of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in supporting national parliaments to unlock political and legislative obstacles to ensure an enabling legal environment supportive of effective national responses to HIV and AIDS;
26.	Take note of the report of the Secretary-General entitled "On the fast track to ending the AIDS epidemic"24 and of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 2016-2021 Strategy, including its goals and targets, as well as the World Health Organization Global Health Sector Strategy on HIV, 2016-2021;
27.	Take note with appreciation of the HIV-relevant strategies of the Co-sponsors of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and commend the secretariat and the Co-sponsors for their contribution on AIDS policy, strategic information and coordination and for the support they provide to countries through the Joint Programme;
28.	Note the recommendations made by the Global Commission on HIV and the Law, co-convened by the United Nations Development Programme and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, and the Joint Programme-Lancet Commission "Defeating AIDS - Advancing Global Health" in advancing progress towards ending the AIDS epidemic; 
29.	Recognize the role that community organizations play, including those led and run by people living with HIV, in supporting and sustaining national and local HIV and AIDS responses, reaching all people living with HIV, delivering prevention, treatment, care and support services and strengthening health systems, in particular the primary health-care approach;
30.	Welcome the leadership and commitment shown in every aspect of the HIV and AIDS response by Governments, relevant United Nations agencies and regional and subregional organizations, as well as people living with, at risk of and affected by HIV, political and community leaders, parliamentarians, communities, families, faith-based organizations, scientists, health professionals, donors, the philanthropic community, the workforce, the private sector, the media and civil society, including women's and community-based organizations, feminist groups, youth-led organizations, national human rights institutions and human rights defenders, and recognize their contribution to the achievement of Millennium Development Goal 6 on AIDS and implementing the commitments set forth in the 2011 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS,25 and call upon stakeholders, as appropriate, to support Member States in ensuring that country-driven, credible, costed, evidence-based, inclusive, sustainable, gender-responsive and comprehensive national HIV and AIDS strategic plans are funded and implemented as soon as possible with transparency, accountability and effectiveness;

2011-2016: Reflecting on unprecedented achievements and acknowledging those left behind
31.	Recognize that the AIDS response has been transformative, demonstrating outstanding global solidarity and shared responsibility, advancing innovative cross-sectoral and people-centred approaches to global health and fostering unprecedented levels of comprehensive research and development;
32.	Welcome the achievement of the HIV and AIDS targets of Millennium Development Goal 6 and recognize that, while significant progress was made on all the Millennium Development Goals, urgent efforts are needed to complete the unfinished business of the Goals and the 2011 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS as we implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to end the AIDS epidemic by 2030;
33.	Note with deep concern that the HIV epidemic remains a paramount health, development, human rights and social challenge inflicting immense suffering on countries, communities and families throughout the world, that since the beginning of the epidemic there have been an estimated 76 million HIV infections and that 34 million people have died from AIDS, that AIDS is the leading cause of death among women and adolescent girls of reproductive age (ages 15-49) globally, that about 14 million children have been orphaned owing to AIDS, and that 6,000 new HIV infections occur every day, mostly among people in developing countries, and note with alarm that, among the 36.9 million people living with HIV, more than 19 million people do not know their status;
34.	Welcome the significant achievement in extending access to antiretroviral treatment to more than 15 million people living with HIV by 2015, but express grave concern that despite the recommended expansion of antiretroviral treatment eligibility to all persons living with HIV, more than half of all people living with HIV do not know their status, 22 million people living with HIV remain without antiretroviral treatment, and a substantial proportion of people on antiretroviral therapy face social and structural barriers to good health, including poor-quality care, economic constraints, stigma and discrimination, harmful practices and beliefs, inefficient service delivery models, poor nutrition and lack of food, medication side effects and misuse, and lack of comprehensive social protection, care and support, and as a result do not start treatment in a timely fashion, struggle to adhere to treatment and fail to achieve viral suppression, resulting in a growing risk of emergence of drug-resistant strains, which poses a threat to the expansion of effective HIV treatment and prevention;
35.	Note with deep concern the unacceptably low rates of testing and treatment coverage among children in developing countries, which are a result of social and structural barriers similar to those that the adult population faces, as well as age-specific barriers, including low rates of early infant diagnosis, inadequate case-finding of children outside of prevention of mother-to-child transmission settings, long delays in returning test results, poor linking of children to treatment, lack of adequate training for health-care workers in paediatric HIV testing, treatment and care, challenges with long-term adherence, the limited number and inadequate availability of efficacious antiretroviral child-friendly formulations in certain countries and regions, stigma and discrimination, and lack of adequate social protection for children and caregivers;
36.	Acknowledge the progress made since the launch of the Global Plan towards the Elimination of New HIV Infections among Children by 2015 and Keeping Their Mothers Alive: 2011-2015, including that an estimated 85 countries are within reach of elimination of mother-to-child transmission, but note that continued efforts are greatly needed;
37.	Reaffirm that access to safe, effective and affordable medicines and commodities for all, without discrimination, in the context of epidemics such as HIV and AIDS is fundamental to the full realization of the right of everyone to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, yet note with grave concern the high number of people without access to medicine and that the sustainability of providing lifelong safe, effective and affordable HIV treatment continues to be threatened by factors such as poverty and migration, lack of access to services and insufficient and unpredictable funding, especially for those left behind, and underscore that access to medicines would save millions of lives;
38.	Welcome the reduction in the number of deaths among people living with HIV in some countries, in particular the reduction in the number of tuberculosis-related deaths among people living with HIV, which have fallen by 32 per cent since 2004, yet note with grave concern that, among people living with HIV, tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death and viral hepatitis is a significant cause of ill-health and mortality and that congenital syphilis continues to affect large numbers of pregnant women at risk of HIV and their infants;
39.	Express grave concern that young people between the ages of 15 and 24 years account for more than one third of all new HIV infections among adults, with 2,000 young people becoming infected with HIV each day, and that AIDS-related deaths are increasing among adolescents, making AIDS the second leading cause of death in adolescents globally, and note that many young people have limited access to good-quality education, nutritious food, decent employment and recreational facilities, as well as limited access to sexual and reproductive health-care services and programmes that provide the commodities, skills, knowledge and capability they need to protect themselves from HIV, that only 36 per cent of young men and 28 per cent of young women (15-24) possess accurate knowledge of HIV, and that laws and policies in some instances exclude young people from accessing sexual and reproductive health-care and HIV-related services, such as voluntary and confidential HIV testing, counselling, information and education, while also recognizing the importance of reducing risk-taking behaviour and encouraging responsible sexual behaviour, including correct and consistent use of condoms;
40.	Recognize the need to promote, protect and fulfil the rights of children in child-headed households, in particular those headed by girls, which may result from the death of parents and legal guardians and other economic, social and political realities, and express deep concern that the impact of the AIDS epidemic, including illness and mortality, the erosion of the extended family, the exacerbation of poverty, unemployment and underemployment and migration, as well as urbanization, has contributed to the increase in the number of child-headed households;
41.	Remain deeply concerned that, globally, women and girls are still the most affected by the epidemic and that they bear a disproportionate share of the caregiving burden, note that progress towards gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls has been unacceptably slow and that the ability of women and girls to protect themselves from HIV continues to be compromised by physiological factors, gender inequalities, including unequal power relations in society between women and men and boys and girls, and unequal legal, economic and social status, insufficient access to health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health, and all forms of discrimination and violence in the public and private spheres, including trafficking in persons, sexual violence, exploitation and harmful practices;
42.	Note with alarm the slow progress in reducing new infections and the limited scale of combination prevention programmes, emphasizing that each country should define the specific populations that are key to its epidemic and response, based on the local epidemiological context, and note with grave concern that women and adolescent girls, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa, are more than twice as likely to become HIV-positive than boys of the same age, and noting also that many national HIV prevention, testing and treatment programmes provide insufficient access to services for women and adolescent girls, migrants and key populations that epidemiological evidence shows are globally at higher risk of HIV, specifically people who inject drugs, who are 24 times more likely to acquire HIV than adults in the general population, sex workers, who are 10 times more likely to acquire HIV, men who have sex with men, who are 24 times more likely to acquire HIV, transgender people, who are 49 times more likely to be living with HIV, and prisoners, who are 5 times more likely to be living with HIV than adults in the general population;
43.	Note that some countries and regions have made significant progress in expanding health-related risk and harm reduction programmes, in accordance with national legislation, as well as antiretroviral therapy and other relevant interventions that prevent the transmission of HIV, viral hepatitis and other blood-borne diseases associated with drug use, yet note the lack of global progress made in reducing transmission of HIV among people who use drugs, particularly those who inject drugs, and call attention to the insufficient coverage of such programmes and substance use treatment programmes that improve adherence to HIV drug treatment services, as appropriate in the context of national programmes, the marginalization of and discrimination against people who use drugs through the application of restrictive laws, particularly those who inject drugs, which hamper access to HIV-related services, and in that regard consider ensuring access to such interventions, including in treatment and outreach services, prisons and other custodial settings, and promoting in that regard the use, as appropriate, of the technical guide for countries to set targets for universal access to HIV prevention, treatment and care for injecting drug users, issued by the World Health Organization, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, and note with concern that gender-based and age-based stigma and discrimination often act as additional barriers for women and for young people who use drugs, particularly those who inject drugs, to access services;
44.	Express grave concern that, despite a general decline in discriminatory attitudes and policies towards people living with, presumed to be living with, at risk of and affected by HIV, including those co-infected by tuberculosis, particularly in countries with a high tuberculosis/HIV burden, discrimination continues to be reported, and that restrictive legal and policy frameworks, including those related to HIV transmission, continue to discourage and prevent people from accessing prevention, treatment, care and support services;
45.	Note with grave concern that, despite the recognition of the need to promote, protect and fulfil the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons with disabilities, including as set forth in the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and despite the increased vulnerability to HIV infection faced by women and girls living with disabilities resulting from, inter alia, legal and economic inequalities, sexual and gender-based violence, discrimination and violations of their human rights, the formulation of the global AIDS response remains inadequately targeted and accessible to persons with disabilities;
46.	Remain concerned that discriminatory laws and policies that restrict movement of people living with HIV may result in substantial harm and denial of HIV services, while acknowledging the steps taken by some countries in repealing entry, stay and residence restrictions based on HIV status and that many corporate leaders promoted the business case for non-discrimination;
47.	Note with grave concern that the holistic needs and human rights of people living with, at risk of and affected by HIV, and of young people, remain insufficiently addressed because of inadequate integration of health services, including sexual and reproductive health-care and HIV services, including for people who have experienced sexual or gender-based violence, including post-exposure prophylaxis, legal services and social protection;
48.	Welcome the important progress achieved in research for new biomedical tools for prevention, notably regarding treatment as prevention, pre-exposure prophylaxis and antiretroviral-based microbicides and voluntary medical male circumcision, but also recognize that research and development must be accelerated, including for long-acting formulations of pre-exposure prophylaxis, preventive and therapeutic HIV vaccines and curative interventions;
49.	Recognize that each country faces specific challenges to achieving sustainable development, and we underscore the special challenges facing the most vulnerable countries and, in particular, African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, as well as the specific challenges facing the middle-income countries, and note that countries in situations of conflict also need special attention;
50.	Acknowledge the significant mobilization of resources globally that reached an estimated 19.2 billion United States dollars for HIV programmes in low- and middle-income countries in 2014,26 and acknowledge the important role played by complementary innovative sources of financing;
51.	Welcome the near tripling of domestic HIV investment between 2006 and 2014, with domestic sources accounting for 57 per cent of all investments in 2014, and note the role that the African Union Road Map on Shared Responsibility and Global Solidarity for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria Response in Africa has played in this regard;
52.	Recognize that there are still gaps in financing for HIV and AIDS and the need to further encourage technology transfer on mutually agreed terms, improve access to medicines in developing countries and scale up capacity-building and research and development;
53.	Note that many countries have the ability to invest much more than they currently do: among developed countries, only four invest a share of the total international resources available for AIDS that exceeds their country's proportion of world gross domestic product; and that both developed and developing countries should work towards significantly increasing funding, including domestic funding, for the HIV and AIDS response;
54.	Recognize that if we do not fast-track the response across the prevention and treatment continuum in the next five years, by increasing and front-loading investments and massively scaling up coverage of HIV services, so as to reduce the rate of new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths, the epidemic may rebound in some countries and we may not reach the ambitious, time-bound targets and commitments hereby set, including the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS 90-90-90 treatment targets,23 by 2020 and the target of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030;

2016-2021: global leadership on uniting to fast-track the HIV and AIDS response
55.	Commit to seizing this turning point in the HIV epidemic and, through decisive, inclusive and accountable leadership, to revitalizing and intensifying the comprehensive global HIV and AIDS response by recommitting to the commitments made in the 2001 Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS and the 2006 and 2011 political declarations on HIV/AIDS and by fully implementing the commitments, goals and targets contained in the present Declaration;
56.	Commit to targets for 2020 to work towards reducing the global numbers of people newly infected with HIV to fewer than 500,000 per annum and people dying from AIDS-related causes to fewer than 500,000 per annum, as well as to eliminate HIV-related stigma and discrimination;
57.	Commit to differentiating AIDS responses, based on country ownership and leadership, local priorities, drivers, vulnerabilities, aggravating factors, the populations that are affected and strategic information and evidence, and to setting ambitious quantitative targets, where appropriate depending on epidemiological and social context, tailored to national circumstances in support of these goals;
58.	Recognize that achieving the fast-track targets can support global efforts to eradicate all forms of poverty and inequality as well as to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, which are universal, integrated and indivisible, and in this regard we should front-load and diversify resources to fast-track the AIDS response and make progress on five strategic HIV-related areas, recognizing also that investing in efforts to meet a wide range of Sustainable Development Goal targets will support efforts to end the AIDS epidemic; 

Front-loading and diversifying resources are critical to fast-tracking the AIDS response
59 (a).	Commit to increasing and front-loading investments to achieve the fast-track targets by 2020 as an essential milestone towards the target of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030 and positively contributing to a wide range of development outcomes;
59 (b).	Commit to increasing and fully funding the AIDS response from all sources, including from innovative financing, and reaching overall financial investments in developing countries of at least 26 billion dollars per year by 2020, as estimated by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS, with a continued increase from the current levels of domestic public and private sources, according to each country's capacity, supplemented by public and private international assistance and strengthened global solidarity, and urge all stakeholders to contribute to a successful fifth and subsequent replenishments of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria;
59 (c).	Call upon all relevant stakeholders to close the global HIV and AIDS resource gap between the resources available today and the resources needed to reach the fast-track targets by 2020;
59 (d).	Reaffirm our strong commitment to the full and timely implementation of the concrete policies and actions of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda in order to close the global HIV and AIDS resource gap and to fully fund the HIV and AIDS response with the target of ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030. The Addis Ababa Action Agenda relates to domestic public resources, domestic and international private business and finance, international development cooperation, international trade as an engine for development, debt and debt sustainability, addressing systemic issues and science, technology, innovation and capacity-building, and data, monitoring and follow-up;
59 (e).	Acknowledge that, for all countries, public policies and the mobilization of domestic resources, underscored by the principle of national ownership, are central to our common pursuit of sustainable development, including achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and remain committed to further strengthening the mobilization and effective use of domestic resources;
59 (f).	Further acknowledge that private business activity, investment and innovation are major drivers of productivity, inclusive economic growth and job creation and that private investment capital flows, particularly foreign direct investment, along with a stable international financial system, are vital complements to national development efforts;
59 (g).	Recognize that international public finance plays an important role in complementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited domestic resources. Scaled up and more effective international support, including both concessional and non-concessional financing, is required;
59 (h).	Reiterate that the fulfilment of all official development assistance (ODA) commitments remains crucial. ODA providers reaffirm their respective ODA commitments, including the commitment by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance (ODA/GNI) and 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries. We are encouraged by those few countries that have met or surpassed their commitment to 0.7 per cent of ODA/GNI and the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries. We urge all others to step up efforts to increase their ODA and to make additional concrete efforts towards their ODA targets. We welcome the decision by the European Union which reaffirms its collective commitment to achieve the 0.7 per cent of ODA/GNI target within the time frame of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and undertakes to meet collectively the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries in the short term and to reach 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries within the time frame of the 2030 Agenda. We encourage ODA providers to consider setting a target to provide at least 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to least developed countries;
59 (i).	Recognize that South-South cooperation is an important element of international cooperation for development as a complement, not a substitute, to North-South cooperation. We recognize its increased importance, different history and particularities and stress that South-South cooperation should be seen as an expression of solidarity among peoples and countries of the South, based on their shared experiences and objectives. It should continue to be guided by the principles of respect for national sovereignty, national ownership and independence, equality, non-conditionality, non-interference in domestic affairs and mutual benefit;
59 (j).	Welcome the increased contributions of South-South cooperation to poverty eradication and sustainable development.

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/51/503/Add.1)]


51/236.Financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia,1 the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions2 and the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services,3

	Recalling Security Council resolution 854 (1993) of 6 August 1993, by which the Council approved the deployment of an advance team of up to ten United Nations military observers for a period of three months and the incorporation of the advance team into a United Nations observer mission if such a mission was formally established by the Council,

	Recalling also Security Council resolution 858 (1993) of 24 August 1993, by which the Council decided to establish the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Observer Mission, the latest of which was resolution 1096 (1997) of 30 January 1997,

	Recalling further its decision 48/475 A of 23 December 1993 on the financing of the Observer Mission and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which was decision 51/406 of 17 October 1996,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Observer Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,


	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Observer Mission, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Observer Mission,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Observer Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia as at 15 May 1997, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 6 million United States dollars, representing 12 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Observer Mission to the period ending 30 June 1997, notes that some 20 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

	4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Observer Mission in full and on time;

	5.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;2

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Observer Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia the amount of 18,580,500 dollars gross (17,582,100 dollars net) for the maintenance of the Observer Mission for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998, inclusive of the amount of 765,300 dollars for the support account for peacekeeping operations, to be assessed on Member States at a monthly rate of 1,548,375 dollars gross (1,465,175 dollars net) in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224

of 11 April 1996 and 51/218 A and B of 18 December 1996 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and 50/451 B of 23 December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the year 1997, as set out in its resolution 49/19 B of 23 December 1994 and its decision 50/471 A
of 23 December 1995, and for the year 1998,4 subject to the decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the Observer Mission beyond
31 July 1997;

	8.	Decides also that, in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955, there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 7 above, their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated staff assessment income of 998,400 dollars approved for the Observer Mission for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998;

	9.	Decides further that, for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission, there shall be set off against the apportionment, as provided for in paragraph 7 above, their respective share in the unencumbered balance of 1,056,950 dollars gross (831,900 dollars net) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1996;

	10.	Decides that, for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Observer Mission, their share of the unencumbered balance of 1,056,950 dollars gross (831,900 dollars net) for the period ending 30 June 1996 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations;

	11.	Invites voluntary contributions to the Observer Mission in cash and in the form of services and supplies acceptable to the Secretary-General, to be administered, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedure and practices established by the General Assembly;

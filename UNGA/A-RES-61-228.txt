	7.	Calls upon Member States, in particular malaria-endemic countries, to establish and/or strengthen national policies and operational plans, aspiring to ensure that at least 80 per cent of those at risk of or suffering from malaria may benefit from major preventive and curative interventions by 2010, in accordance with the technical recommendations of the World Health Organization, so as to ensure a reduction in the burden of malaria by at least 50 per cent by 2010 and 75 per cent by 2015;
	8.	Urges Member States to assess and respond to the needs for integrated human resources at all levels of the health system, in order to achieve the targets of the Abuja Declaration on Roll Back Malaria in Africa8 and the internationally agreed development goals of the United Nations Millennium Declaration,2 to take actions, as appropriate, to effectively govern the recruitment, training and retention of skilled health personnel, and to give particular focus to the availability of skilled personnel at all levels to meet technical and operational needs as increased funding for malaria control programmes becomes available;
	9.	Calls upon the international community, inter alia, by helping to meet the financial needs of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and through country-led initiatives with adequate international support, to intensify access to affordable, safe and effective antimalarial combination treatments, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancies, insecticide-treated mosquito nets, including through the free distribution of such nets where appropriate, and insecticides for indoor residual spraying for malaria control, taking into account relevant international rules, standards and guidelines;
	10.

	11.	Encourages all African countries that have not yet done so to implement the recommendations of the Abuja Summit in 20003 to reduce or waive taxes and tariffs for nets and other products needed for malaria control, both to reduce the price of the products to consumers and to stimulate free trade in those products;

[on the report of the Third Committee (A/67/458)]
67/185.	Promoting efforts to eliminate violence against migrants, migrant workers and their families


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 66/172 of 19 December 2011, entitled "Protection of migrants",
	Recognizing that violence against migrants, migrant workers and their families poses a serious challenge to Member States and requires multilateral cooperation among all countries for its eradication,
	Recognizing also that the challenges include violence perpetrated by organized criminal groups, including violence motivated by racism,
	Deeply concerned about acts of intolerance, discrimination and violence and credible threats of violence against migrants, migrant workers and their families,
	Recognizing that impediments to accessing employment, vocational training, housing, schooling, health services and social services, as well as other services that, in accordance with national legislation, are intended for use by the public, contribute to the vulnerability of migrants,
	Noting that the factors that drive people to seek to cross international borders are many and varied and that, while the majority may be motivated by economic factors, in some cases migrants may include vulnerable groups,
	Aware that, as criminals take advantage of migratory flows and attempt to circumvent border controls, migrants become more vulnerable to, inter alia, kidnapping, extortion, forced labour, sexual exploitation, physical assault, debt servitude and abandonment,
	Concerned about the large numbers of migrants, especially women and children, who attempt to cross international borders without appropriate travel documents, which renders them highly vulnerable, and recognizing the obligation of Member States to treat migrants humanely, with full protection of their rights, regardless of their immigration status,
	Bearing in mind the need for a focused and consistent criminal justice approach to crimes committed against migrants, in particular women and children, as a group that is especially vulnerable to crime and abuse,
	Recognizing the importance of the principle of access to justice, and convinced that, without access to justice, basic human rights cannot be fully realized,
	Reaffirming the importance of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 in which it is stated that everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of person, that no one should be held in slavery or servitude or be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration, without distinction of any kind,
	Reaffirming also that effective action to prevent and combat the smuggling of migrants by land, sea and air requires a comprehensive international approach,
	Noting the obligations of Member States under international law, as applicable, to prevent crimes against migrants, to investigate such crimes and to punish perpetrators, and bearing in mind that not doing so impairs the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of victims of such crimes,
	Stressing the need for additional cooperation among Member States and between Member States and private sector entities to counter transnational organized crime,
	Stressing also the need to fully implement the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,2 the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,3 and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,4 and to take appropriate measures to afford migrants effective protection against the types of violence that may be inflicted upon them, including protection from potential retaliation or intimidation for testifying as witnesses in criminal proceedings,
	Recalling its resolution 64/293 of 30 July 2010, entitled "United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons", and Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice resolution 20/3 of 15 April 2011, entitled "Implementation of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons",5 stressing the need for full and effective implementation of the Plan of Action, and expressing the view that it will, inter alia, enhance cooperation and better coordination of efforts to fight trafficking in persons and for full implementation of the Convention and the Trafficking in Persons Protocol,
	Reaffirming that crimes against migrants, including trafficking in persons, continue to pose a serious challenge and require a concerted international assessment and response and genuine multilateral cooperation among countries of origin, transit and destination for their eradication,
	Taking note with appreciation of the work of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to highlight the vulnerability of smuggled migrants to violence, including the study entitled "Smuggling of migrants: a global review and annotated bibliography of recent publications", first published in 2010, and the discussion guide for the thematic discussion on violence against migrants, migrant workers and their families,6

	8.	Emphasizes the importance of protecting persons in vulnerable situations, and in that regard expresses its concern about the increase in the activities of transnational and national organized criminal entities and others who profit from crimes against migrants, especially women and children, without regard for dangerous and inhumane conditions and in flagrant violation of national laws and international law;
	9.	Urges Member States to fully use, where pertinent, international cooperation in their investigations and prosecution of crimes involving violence against migrants, migrant workers and their families, and encourages States parties to the Convention and the relevant Protocols thereto to avail themselves of the international cooperation framework of those instruments and all others to ensure that they have an adequate legal framework to allow for extradition, mutual legal assistance and international cooperation in relation to such crimes;

	The General Assembly,

	Convinced that the use of nuclear weapons poses the most serious threat to the survival of mankind,

	Convinced also that a multilateral agreement prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons should strengthen international security and contribute to the climate for negotiations leading to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons,

	Conscious that the recent steps taken by the Russian Federation and the United States of America towards a reduction of their nuclear weapons and the improvement in the international climate can contribute towards the goal of complete elimination of nuclear weapons,

	Stressing that an international convention would be a step towards the complete elimination of nuclear weapons leading to general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control,

	Noting with regret that the Conference on Disarmament, during its 1993 session, was unable to undertake negotiations on this subject,

	1.	Reiterates its request to the Conference on Disarmament to commence negotiations, as a matter of priority, in order to reach agreement on an international convention prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances, taking as a possible basis the draft Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons annexed to the present resolution;

___________

	2/	Resolution S-10/2.

	2.	Requests the Conference on Disarmament to report to the General Assembly on the results of those negotiations.

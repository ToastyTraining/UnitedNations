	Recalling also its resolutions 49/127 of 19 December 1994, 50/123 of 20 December 1995, 52/189 of 18 December 1997 and 54/212 of 22 December 1999 on international migration and development, as well as Economic and Social Council decision 1995/313 of 27 July 1995,
	Reaffirming the continuing validity of the principles set forth in the international instruments regarding the protection of human rights, in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,7 the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,8 the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women9 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child,10
	Recalling that heads of State and Government, gathered at the United Nations Millennium Summit from 6 to 8 September 2000, committed themselves to respect for all internationally recognized human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to development,11
	Recalling also that heads of State and Government at the United Nations Millennium Summit resolved to take measures, inter alia, to ensure respect for and protection of the human rights of migrants, migrant workers and their families, to eliminate the increasing acts of racism and xenophobia in many societies and to promote greater harmony and tolerance in all societies,
	Reaffirming that the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council should carry out their respective responsibilities as entrusted to them in the Charter of the United Nations, as well as by the relevant United Nations conferences of the 1990s, in the formulation of policies and the provision of guidance to and coordination of United Nations activities in the field of population and development, including activities on international migration,
	Noting the need for the relevant United Nations organizations and other international organizations to enhance their financial and technical support to developing countries as well as countries with economies in transition to ensure that migration contributes to development,
	Recognizing the diversity of views expressed by the respondents to the survey regarding the question of convening a United Nations conference on international migration, its scope, form and agenda,12 which represented 41 per cent of the full United Nations membership, and that forty-seven respondents were in favour of convening a conference, five were partially in favour and twenty-six were against,
	Noting in particular the need for more migration data, analysis of factors influencing international migration and of its impact, and a better understanding of the complex interrelationships between migration and development,
	Noting the critical role of the existing forums within the United Nations system in addressing the issues of international migration and development, including through the Commission on Population and Development, the Commission on Human Rights, the Committee for Development Policy, the International Labour Organization and other relevant key organizations,
	Noting with appreciation the numerous meetings and conferences convened relating to migration and development,13 in particular in the context of regional cooperation,

	Noting also the work of the Secretariat in the field of migration and development,
	Aware that, among other important factors, both domestic and international, the widening economic and social gap between and among many countries and the marginalization of some countries in the global economy, due in part to the uneven impact of the benefits of globalization and liberalization, have contributed to large flows of people between and among countries and to the intensification of the complex phenomenon of international migration,
	Aware also that, in spite of the existence of an already established body of principles, there is a need to make further efforts to ensure that the human rights and dignity of all migrants and their families are respected and protected and that it is desirable to improve the situation of all documented migrants and their families,
	Recognizing the importance, from an analytical and operational point of view, of identifying the existing linkages among the social, economic, political and cultural factors related to international migration and development and of the need for comprehensive, coherent and effective policies on international migration based on the spirit of genuine partnership and common understanding,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;14
	2.	Urges Member States and the United Nations system to strengthen international cooperation in the area of international migration and development in order to address the root causes of migration, especially those related to poverty, and to maximize the benefits of international migration to those concerned;
	3.	Encourages, where relevant, interregional, regional and subregional mechanisms to continue to address the question of migration and development;
	4.	Calls upon all relevant bodies, agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system and other relevant intergovernmental, regional and subregional organizations, within their continuing mandated activities, to continue to address the issue of international migration and development and to provide appropriate support for interregional, regional and subregional processes and activities on international migration and development, with a view to integrating migration issues in a more coherent way within the broader context of the implementation of agreed economic and social development programmes;
	5.	Encourages Governments of countries of origin, countries of transit and countries of destination to increase cooperation on issues related to migrations and to engage in further dialogue, including through relevant subregional, regional and international processes and organizations, as appropriate, including on the question of the convening of a United Nations conference on international migration and development;
	6.	Calls upon the United Nations, in collaboration with other relevant organizations and agencies, to provide support for dialogue involving Governments and other relevant stakeholders on international migration and development issues;
	7.	Encourages the international community, including donor countries, relevant United Nations bodies and other relevant international organizations and the private sector to provide support, including financial and technical support, for data collection and greater empirical research by Member States, in particular developing countries, and the relevant bodies of the United Nations system and other relevant international organizations on the causes and patterns of migration, including on irregular migration and trafficking, as well as its social, economic and demographic impacts, and for documenting and disseminating information on the successful management of all aspects of migration;
	8.	Invites Governments, with the assistance of the international community, where appropriate, to seek to make the option of remaining in one's country viable for all people, in particular through efforts to achieve sustainable development, leading to a better economic balance between developed and developing countries;
	9.	Requests the Secretary-General to solicit, one additional time, the views of Member States that have not responded to the survey requested in pursuance of resolution 52/189, as well as those of the International Labour Organization, the International Organization for Migration and other relevant organizations, both within and outside the United Nations system, and their views on his report submitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session,14 bearing in mind various regional processes, and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session;

	11.	Further requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution that will, inter alia, update the lessons learned, as well as best practices on migration management and policies, from the various activities relating to international migration and development that have been carried out at the regional and interregional levels, and submit action-oriented recommendations for the consideration of the Assembly;

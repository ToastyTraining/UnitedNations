51/31.Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies


	The General Assembly,

	Bearing in mind the indissoluble links between the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 and the foundations of any democratic society,

	Recalling the Manila Declaration2 adopted by the First International Conference of New or Restored Democracies3 in June 1988,

	Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, including the promotion and encouragement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and other important principles, such as respect for the equal rights and self-determination of peoples, peace, democracy, justice, equality, the rule of law, pluralism, development, better standards of living and solidarity,

	Recalling its resolutions 49/30 of 7 December 1994 and 50/133 of 20 December 1995, in which it recognized the importance of the Managua Declaration4 and Plan of Action5 adopted by the Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies in July 1994,


	Recalling also the view expressed in the Managua Declaration that the international community must pay closer attention to the obstacles facing the new or restored democracies,

	Taking note of the views of Member States expressed in the debate on this item at its forty-ninth, fiftieth and fifty-first sessions,

	Taking note also of the holding of the Informal Ministerial Meeting of New or Restored Democracies in New York on 30 September 1996 in accordance with the Managua Plan of Action,

	Bearing in mind that such activities of the United Nations carried out in support of the efforts of Governments are undertaken in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and only at the specific request of the Member States concerned,

	Bearing in mind also that democracy, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives,

	Noting that a considerable number of societies have recently undertaken considerable efforts to achieve their social, political and economic goals through democratization and the reform of their economies, pursuits that are deserving of the support and recognition of the international community,

	Noting with satisfaction that the Third International Conference of New or Restored Democracies will take place at Bucharest from 2 to 4 September 1997,

	Stressing the importance of support by Member States, the United Nations system, the specialized agencies and other intergovernmental organizations of the holding of the Third International Conference,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General6 on assistance provided in the past by the United Nations, at the request of Member States, as well as important concepts and considerations that are pertinent to this question,

	1.	Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General;6

	2.	Commends the Secretary-General, and through him the United Nations system, for the activities undertaken at the request of Governments to support the efforts to consolidate democracy, as reflected in his report;


	3.	Recognizes that the Organization has an important role to play in providing timely, appropriate and coherent support to the efforts of Governments to achieve democratization within the context of their development efforts;

	4.	Stresses that activities undertaken by the Organization must be in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations;

	5.	Encourages the Secretary-General to continue to improve the capacity of the Organization to respond effectively to the request of Member States through coherent, adequate support of their efforts to achieve the goal of democratization;

	6.	Encourages Member States to promote democratization and to make additional efforts to identify possible steps to support the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies;

	7.	Invites the Secretary-General, Member States, the relevant specialized agencies and bodies of the United Nations system, as well as other intergovernmental organizations, to collaborate in the holding of the Third International Conference of New or Restored Democracies;

	8.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session on the implementation of the present resolution, including innovative ways and means as well as other reflections, to enable the Organization to respond effectively and in an integrated manner to requests of Member States for assistance in the field of democratization;

	9.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-second session the item entitled "Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies".

	Deeply concerned that extreme poverty persists in all countries of the world, regardless of their economic, social and cultural situation, and that its extent and its manifestations, such as hunger, trafficking in human beings, disease, lack of adequate shelter, illiteracy and hopelessness, are particularly severe in developing countries, while acknowledging the significant progress made in several parts of the world in combating extreme poverty,
	Deeply concerned also that gender inequality, violence and discrimination exacerbate extreme poverty, disproportionally impacting women and girls,

	Concerned by the challenges faced today, including those derived from the financial and economic crisis, the food crisis and ongoing concerns over food security, as well as the increasing challenges posed by climate change and the loss of biodiversity, and by their impact on the increase in the number of people living in extreme poverty and their negative effect on the capacity of all States, especially developing countries, to fight extreme poverty,
	Recognizing that the eradication of extreme poverty is a major challenge within the process of globalization and requires coordinated and continued policies through decisive national action and international cooperation,

	Stressing the necessity of better understanding and addressing the causes and consequences of extreme poverty,
	Reaffirming that, since the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full and effective enjoyment of human rights and may, in some situations, constitute a threat to the right to life, its immediate alleviation and eventual eradication must remain a high priority for the international community,
	Stressing that respect for all human rights, which are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, is of crucial importance for all policies and programmes to fight extreme poverty,
	Reaffirming that democracy, development and the full and effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and contribute to the eradication of extreme poverty,

	3.

	9.	Recalls that promoting universal access to social services and providing social protection floors can make an important contribution to consolidating and achieving further development gains and that social protection systems that address and reduce inequality and social exclusion are essential for protecting the gains made towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and in this regard takes note of International Labour Organization Recommendation No. 202 on social protection floors;
	10.	Encourages States, when designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating social protection programmes, to ensure gender mainstreaming and the promotion and protection of all human rights in accordance with their obligations under international human rights law, through this process;
	11.	Also encourages States to take all necessary measures to eliminate discrimination against all persons, in particular those living in poverty, to refrain from adopting any laws, regulations or practices denying or limiting the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including economic, social and cultural rights, and to ensure that people, in particular those living in poverty, have equal access to justice;
	12.	Welcomes the ongoing efforts to strengthen and support South-South cooperation and triangular cooperation, and stresses that South-South cooperation is not a substitute for, but rather a complement to, North-South cooperation;
	13.	Encourages the international community to strengthen its efforts to address challenges that are contributing to extreme poverty, including those derived from the financial and economic crisis, the food crisis and ongoing concerns over food security, as well as the increasing challenges posed by climate change and the loss of biodiversity in all parts of the world, especially in developing countries, by enhancing its cooperation to help to build national capacities;
	14.	Reaffirms the critical role of both formal and informal education in the achievement of poverty eradication and other development goals as envisaged in the Millennium Declaration, in particular basic education and training for eradicating illiteracy, and efforts towards expanded secondary and higher education as well as vocational education and technical training, especially for girls and women, the creation of human resources and infrastructure capabilities and the empowerment of those living in poverty, in this context reaffirms the Dakar Framework for Action adopted at the World Education Forum on 28 April 2000,17 and recognizes the importance of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization strategy for the eradication of poverty, especially extreme poverty, in supporting the Education for All programmes as a tool to achieve the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary education by 2015;
	15.	Invites the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to give high priority to the question of the relationship between extreme poverty and human rights, and also invites her to further pursue the work in this area;
	16.	Calls upon States, United Nations bodies, in particular the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Development Programme, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations to continue to give appropriate attention to the links between human rights and extreme poverty, and encourages the private sector and international financial institutions to proceed likewise;
	17.	Takes note with appreciation of the guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights,13 adopted by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 21/1112 as a useful tool for States in the formulation and implementation of poverty reduction and eradication policies, as appropriate;

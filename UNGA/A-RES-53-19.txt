53/19.Financing of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

	Recalling Security Council resolution 968 (1994) of 16 December 1994, by which the Council established the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Mission of Observers, the latest of which was resolution 1167 (1998) of 14 May 1998,

	Recalling also Security Council resolution 1138 (1997) of 14 November 1997, by which the Council authorized the Secretary-General to expand the size of the Mission of Observers,

	Recalling further its resolution 49/240 of 31 March 1995 on the financing of the Mission of Observers and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 52/229 B of 26 June 1998,


	Reaffirming that the costs of the Mission of Observers are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission of Observers, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Mission of Observers,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Mission of Observers with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan as at 15 October 1998, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 9.2 million United States dollars, representing some 22 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Mission of Observers to the period ending 31 October 1998, notes that some 16 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

	4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Mission of Observers in full and on time;

	9.	Decides also, as an ad hoc arrangement, and taking into account the amount of 8,015,120 dollars gross (7,587,120 dollars net) already apportioned under the terms of resolution 52/229 B, to apportion the additional amount of 11,984,880 dollars gross (11,128,880 dollars net) for the period from 1 November 1998 to 30 June 1999 among Member States, at a monthly rate of 1,498,110 dollars gross (1,391,110 dollars net), in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996, 51/218 A to C of 18 December 1996 and 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and 50/451 B  of 23 December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the years 1998 and 1999, as set out in its resolution 52/215 A of 22 December 1997, subject to the decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the Mission of Observers beyond 15 November 1998;

	10.

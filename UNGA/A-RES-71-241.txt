	Recognizing the centrality of mobilizing financial and non-financial resources for development at the national and international levels and the effective use of those resources, as well as the importance of policy coherence and an enabling environment for sustainable development, at all levels and by all actors, and of reinvigorating the global partnership for sustainable development in support of the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which builds upon the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals,
	Underscoring that, for all countries, public policies and the mobilization and effective use of domestic resources, underscored by the principle of national ownership, are central to the common pursuit of sustainable development, including achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and recognizing that domestic resources are first and foremost generated by economic growth, supported by an enabling environment at all levels,

Also recognizes that private business activity, investment and innovation are major drivers of productivity, inclusive economic growth and job creation and that private international capital flows, particularly foreign direct investment, along with a stable international financial system, are vital complements to national development efforts;

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/49/820)]


49/217.Proposed programme budget outline for the biennium 1996-1997


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986, by which it requested the Secretary-General to submit in off-budget years an outline of the proposed programme budget for the following biennium,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General, 1/ the related recommendations of the Committee for Programme and Coordination 2/ and the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions contained in its report, 3/

	1.	Reaffirms that the proposed programme budget outline shall contain an indication of (a) a preliminary estimate of resources to accommodate the proposed programme of activities during the biennium; (b) priorities, reflecting general trends of a broad sectoral nature; (c) real growth, positive or negative, compared with the previous budget; and (d) the size of the contingency fund expressed as a percentage of the overall level of resources;

	2.	Reaffirms also that the outline should provide a greater level of predictability of resources required for the following biennium, promote a greater involvement of Member States in the budgetary process and thereby facilitate the broadest possible agreement on the programme budget;


	3.	Endorses the recommendations of the Committee for Programme and Coordination and of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;

	4.	Invites the Secretary-General to prepare his proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997 on the basis of the total preliminary estimate provided by the Advisory Committee of 2,574,000,000 United States dollars at the initial 1994-1995 rates, recosted to 2,548,400,000 dollars at revised 1994-1995 rates and taking into account also actual expenditure data as available for 1994;

	5.	Notes that the preliminary estimate includes a provision to reinforce backstopping of peace-keeping operations, and requests the Secretary-General, in preparing his proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997, to base his request on such decisions as the General Assembly may take on the question of criteria for sharing the costs of backstopping peace-keeping operations;

	6.	Decides that the contingency fund shall be set at the level of 0.75 per cent of the preliminary estimate at 1996-1997 rates, namely, at 20.6 million dollars;

	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit, in the context of his proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997, information on the nature of expenses charged to the contingency fund thus far, as requested by the Advisory Committee in paragraph 10 of its report. 3/

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the support account for peacekeeping operations1 and on strengthening the capacity of the United Nations to manage and sustain peacekeeping operations,2 the reports of the Independent Audit Advisory Committee on the proposed budget for the Office of Internal Oversight Services under the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 20103 and on vacant posts in the Office,4 the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the audit of the Secretariat's structure for managing and sustaining peacekeeping operations5 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,6
	Recognizing the importance of the United Nations being able to respond and deploy rapidly to a peacekeeping operation upon adoption of a relevant resolution of the Security Council, within thirty days for traditional peacekeeping operations and ninety days for complex peacekeeping operations,
	Recognizing also the need for adequate support during all phases of peacekeeping operations, including the liquidation and termination phases,
	Mindful that the level of the support account should broadly correspond to the mandate, number, size and complexity of peacekeeping missions,
	Attaching great importance to the provision of adequate resources for peacekeeping operations and their backstopping as well as for all priority activities of the Organization, in particular activities in the area of development, and underlining the need for genuine and meaningful partnership between the Security Council, the troop-contributing Governments and other Member States,
	1.	Takes note of the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the support account for peacekeeping operations1 and on strengthening the capacity of the United Nations to manage and sustain peacekeeping operations,2 the reports of the Independent Audit Advisory Committee on the proposed budget for the Office of Internal Oversight Services under the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2009 to 30 June 20103 and on vacant posts in the Office4 and the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the audit of the Secretariat's structure for managing and sustaining peacekeeping operations;5
	2.	Reaffirms its role in carrying out a thorough analysis and approval of human and financial resources and policies with a view to ensuring the full, effective and efficient implementation of all mandated programmes and activities and the implementation of policies in this regard;

	4.	Further reaffirms rule 153 of its rules of procedure;
	5.	Reaffirms that the support account funds shall be used for the sole purpose of financing human resources and non-human resource requirements for backstopping and supporting peacekeeping operations at Headquarters, and that any changes in this limitation require the prior approval of the General Assembly;
	6.	Also reaffirms the need for adequate funding for the backstopping of peacekeeping operations, as well as the need for full justification for that funding in support account budget submissions;

	8.

	9.	Affirms the need for the Secretary-General to ensure that the delegation of authority to the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, the Department of Field Support and field missions is in strict compliance with relevant resolutions and decisions, as well as relevant rules and procedures of the General Assembly on this matter;

	13.	Notes that the overall benefits of the restructuring of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support, remain yet to be fully assessed, and, in this regard, requests the Secretary-General to continue to make every effort to strengthen the capacity of the Organization to manage and sustain peacekeeping operations in the face of their surge in volume and complexity;

Stresses, in this regard, the importance for the Office of Internal Oversight Services, in its reports on investigations of fraud and corruption in the Organization, to define and make a clear differentiation between the actual value of financial loss to the Organization, if any, and other findings that may not have direct financial implication and the total number and value of contracts investigated, in order to convey an accurate perception of the value of financial loss;

Reiterates its regret at the delay in the response of the Secretary-General to its outstanding requests in its resolutions 59/288 of 13 April 2005, 61/246 of 22 December 2006, 61/276 of 29 June 2007 and 62/269 of 20 June 2008, and urges him, as a matter of priority, to submit a report on procurement governance and other issues, as requested in resolutions 61/246, 61/276 and 62/269, with full justification of the reasons for the delay;
	25.	Endorses the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,6 subject to the provisions of the present resolution;

Notes the observation of the Board of Auditors that there is no defined formula to show the relationship between the level and complexity of peacekeeping operations and the level of the support account,7 and, in this regard, emphasizes the need to develop a sound approach for determining the proposed support account staffing requirements, so that Member States can make fully informed decisions on resources;

	28.

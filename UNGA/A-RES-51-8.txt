	Recognizing also the intensive efforts by the Government of Nicaragua to promote a sustained economic recovery and the considerable progress made in securing a broad social consensus by means of a process of national dialogue for the adoption of measures to lay the foundations for reconstruction and economic and social development through a comprehensive transition process that will be further consolidated with the holding of free and democratic elections in October 1996,

	Taking into account the commitments adopted by the Central American Presidents at the Central American Environment Summit for Sustainable Development, through the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America, 1/ and, in this context, the special attention required by Nicaragua because of its exceptional situation in order that those important commitments may begin to be implemented,

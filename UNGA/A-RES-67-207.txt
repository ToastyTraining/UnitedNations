67/207.	Follow-up to and implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development 
of Small Island Developing States
	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming the Declaration of Barbados1 and the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States,2 the Mauritius Declaration3 and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States4 and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg Plan of Implementation),5 including chapter VII on the sustainable development of small island developing States, 
	Recalling the outcome document of the high-level review meeting on the implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States6 held in New York on 24 and 25 September 2010,
	Recalling also its resolution 66/198 of 22 December 2011 and all its previous resolutions on the subject,

	Recalling that the Commission on Sustainable Development is the primary intergovernmental forum for monitoring the implementation of the Barbados Programme of Action and the Mauritius Strategy, while recognizing that the institutional framework for sustainable development is currently evolving,

	Recognizing the need to promote the development of regional and national capacities for disaster risk reduction, including by strengthening risk assessments and early warning systems, as well as the reconstruction and rehabilitation of areas affected by natural disasters, including through the further implementation of the internationally agreed framework for disaster risk reduction, the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters,8

	Underlining the intergovernmental nature of the United Nations,
	Reaffirming its resolve to create an environment, at the national and global levels alike, that is conducive to sustainable development and the elimination of poverty,
	Recalling the objectives formulated in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 particularly in regard to developing partnerships through the provision of greater opportunities to the private sector, non-governmental organizations and civil society in general so as to enable them to contribute to the realization of the goals and programmes of the Organization, in particular in the pursuit of development and the eradication of poverty,
	Underlining the importance of the contribution of the private sector, non-governmental organizations and civil society in general to the implementation of the outcomes of United Nations conferences in the economic, social and related fields,
	Recalling the central role and responsibility of Governments in national and international policy-making,

	Underlining the fact that cooperation between the United Nations and all relevant partners, in particular the private sector, shall serve the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and make concrete contributions to the realization of the goals contained in the Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes of major United Nations conferences and summits and their reviews, in particular in the area of development and the eradication of poverty, and shall be undertaken in a manner that maintains the integrity, impartiality and independence of the Organization,
	Emphasizing that all relevant partners, in particular the private sector, can contribute in several ways to addressing the obstacles confronted by developing countries in mobilizing the resources needed to finance their sustainable development, and to the realization of the development goals of the United Nations through, inter alia, financial resources, access to technology, management expertise, and support for programmes, including through the reduced pricing of drugs, where appropriate, for the prevention, care and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other diseases,
	Encouraging the private sector to engage as reliable and consistent partners in the development process and to take into account not only the economic and financial, but also the developmental, social, human rights, gender and environmental implications of their undertakings and, in general, towards accepting and implementing the principle of good corporate citizenship, that is, bringing social values and responsibilities to bear on a conduct and policy premised on profit incentives, in conformity with national laws and regulations,
	Recalling that the International Conference on Financing for Development welcomed all efforts to encourage good corporate citizenship and noted the initiative undertaken in the United Nations to promote global partnerships,2
	Noting that the World Summit on Sustainable Development, in order to promote the effective implementation of Agenda 21 at the international level, encouraged partnership initiatives for implementation by all relevant stakeholders to support the outcome of the Summit,3
	Also noting that the Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 2003/61 of 25 July 2003, reiterated, upon the recommendation of the Commission on Sustainable Development at its eleventh session,4 that partnerships for sustainable development, as voluntary multi-stakeholder initiatives, contribute to the implementation of Agenda 215 and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development ("Johannesburg Plan of Implementation"),6
	Further noting that the Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 2003/15 of 21 July 2003, endorsed the conclusion adopted by the Commission for Social Development at its forty-first session7 that, at the international level, recent initiatives towards building voluntary partnerships for social development should be encouraged,
	Taking note of the work of the United Nations on partnerships, such as the Global Compact Initiative launched by the Secretary-General, the Information and Communication Technologies Task Force and the United Nations Fund for International Partnerships, and welcoming the establishment of a multitude of partnerships at the field level, entered into by various United Nations agencies, non-State partners and Member States, such as the United Nations Public-Private Alliance for Rural Development,
	Stressing that partnerships should focus on the achievement of concrete results,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;8 
	2.	Stresses that the principles and approaches that govern such partnerships should be built on the firm foundation of United Nations purposes and principles, as set out in the Charter of the United Nations, and invites the United Nations system to continue to adhere to a common and systematic approach to partnership which, without imposing undue rigidity in partnership agreements, includes the following principles: common purpose, transparency, bestowing no unfair advantages upon any partner of the United Nations, mutual benefit and mutual respect, accountability, respect for the modalities of the United Nations, striving for balanced representation of relevant partners from developed and developing countries and countries with economies in transition, sectoral and geographic balance, and not compromising the independence and neutrality of the United Nations system in general and the agencies in particular;
	3.	Encourages the relevant United Nations bodies and agencies, and invites the Bretton Woods institutions, as well as the World Trade Organization, to continue to explore possibilities of enhancing the use of partnerships to better implement their goals and programmes, in particular in the pursuit of development and the eradication of poverty, bearing in mind the different mandates, modes of operation and objectives of the bodies and agencies, as well as the particular roles of the non-State partners involved;
	4.	Recalls that the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation6 designated the Commission on Sustainable Development to serve as a focal point for discussions on partnerships that promote sustainable development, and in this context reaffirms the criteria and guidelines for partnerships in the context of the World Summit on Sustainable Development process and its follow-up, as set out by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 2003/61;
	5.	Stresses the importance of the contribution of voluntary partnerships to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 while reiterating that they are a complement to but not intended to substitute for the commitments made by Governments with a view to achieving these goals;
	6.	Also stresses that partnerships should be consistent with national laws, national development strategies and plans, as well as the priorities of countries where their implementation takes place, bearing in mind the relevant guidance provided by Governments;
	7.	Calls upon all bodies within the United Nations system that engage in partnerships to ensure the integrity and independence of the Organization and to include information on partnerships in their regular reporting, as appropriate, on their web sites and through other means;
	8.	Stresses that partnerships should be designed and implemented in a transparent and accountable manner, and in that regard calls upon partners to provide to and exchange relevant information with Governments, other stakeholders and the relevant United Nations agencies and bodies and other international organizations in which they engage, in an appropriate way, including through reports, with particular attention to the importance of sharing among partnerships information on their practical experience;
	9.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to promote the transparency and accountability of partnerships;
	10.	Acknowledges that serving successful partnerships requires specific skills on the part of the Secretariat staff, and calls upon the Secretary-General to continue to support and further to develop such skills, through appropriate training and the sharing of best practices;

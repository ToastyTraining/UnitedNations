Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003
[on the report of the First Committee (A/58/462)]
58/39.	Conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 48/75 J of 16 December 1993, 49/75 O of 15 December 1994, 50/70 L of 12 December 1995, 51/45 Q of 10 December 1996, 52/38 Q of 9 December 1997, 53/77 P of 4 December 1998, 54/54 M of 1 December 1999, 55/33 P of 20 November 2000, 56/24 I of 29 November 2001 and 57/77 of 22 November 2002,
	Recognizing the crucial role of conventional arms control in promoting regional and international peace and security,
	Convinced that conventional arms control needs to be pursued primarily in the regional and subregional contexts since most threats to peace and security in the post-cold-war era arise mainly among States located in the same region or subregion,
	Aware that the preservation of a balance in the defence capabilities of States at the lowest level of armaments would contribute to peace and stability and should be a prime objective of conventional arms control,
	Desirous of promoting agreements to strengthen regional peace and security at the lowest possible level of armaments and military forces,
	Noting with particular interest the initiatives taken in this regard in different regions of the world, in particular the commencement of consultations among a number of Latin American countries and the proposals for conventional arms control made in the context of South Asia, and recognizing, in the context of this subject, the relevance and value of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe,1 which is a cornerstone of European security,
	Believing that militarily significant States and States with larger military capabilities have a special responsibility in promoting such agreements for regional security,
	Believing also that an important objective of conventional arms control in regions of tension should be to prevent the possibility of military attack launched by surprise and to avoid aggression,
	1.	Decides to give urgent consideration to the issues involved in conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels;
	2.	Requests the Conference on Disarmament to consider the formulation of principles that can serve as a framework for regional agreements on conventional arms control, and looks forward to a report of the Conference on this subject;
	3.	Requests the Secretary-General, in the meantime, to seek the views of Member States on the subject and to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session;
	4.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-ninth session the item entitled "Conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels".

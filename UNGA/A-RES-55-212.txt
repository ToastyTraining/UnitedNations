	Expressing concern about the marginalization of a large number of developing countries from the benefits of globalization, the additional vulnerability of those developing countries that are integrating into the world economy and the general accentuation of the income and technological gap between developed and developing countries, as well as within countries,
	Recognizing that globalization and interdependence are opening new opportunities through trade, investment and capital flows and advances in technology, including information technology, for the growth of the world economy, development and the improvement of living standards around the world, and recognizing also that some countries have made progress in successfully adapting to the changes and have benefited from globalization,
	Recognizing also the importance of appropriate policy responses at the national level by all countries to the challenges of globalization, in particular by pursuing sound macroeconomic and social policies, noting the need for support from the international community for the efforts of the least developed countries, in particular, to improve their institutional and management capacities, and recognizing further that all countries should pursue policies conducive to economic growth and to promoting a favourable global economic environment,
	Stressing that such national macroeconomic and social policies can yield better results with international support and with an enabling international economic environment,
	Emphasizing the need to address those imbalances and asymmetries in international finance, trade, technology and investment patterns that have a negative impact on development prospects for developing countries, with a view to minimizing those impacts,
	Noting with serious concern that a large number of developing countries have not yet been able to reap the full benefits of the existing multilateral trading system, and underlining the importance of promoting the integration of developing countries into the world economy so as to enable them to take the fullest possible advantage of the trading opportunities arising from globalization and liberalization,
	Stressing that the process of reform for a strengthened and stable international financial architecture should be based on broad participation in a genuine multilateral approach, involving all members of the international community, to ensure that the diverse needs and interests of all countries are adequately represented,

	3.	Calls for the effective addressing of globalization through, inter alia, making the decision-making process of international economic and financial policy more participatory, especially with regard to developing countries, the integrated consideration of trade, finance, investment, technology transfer and developmental issues by the relevant international institutions, the continuation of a wide range of reforms in the international financial system and further progress towards liberalization and enhanced market access in areas and for products of particular interest to developing countries, and, to this end, also calls for coherence and close cooperation among the United Nations, the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization;

	7.	Encourages developing countries to continue to pursue appropriate development policies to promote economic development and poverty eradication, and, in this regard, invites the international community to pursue strategies that support those policies through continued efforts to address the problems of market access, persistent external debt, transfer of resources, financial vulnerability and declining terms of trade;
	8.	Strongly urges the international community to take all necessary and appropriate measures, including support for structural and macroeconomic reform, foreign direct investment, enhanced official development assistance, the search for a durable solution to the external debt problem, market access, capacity-building and the dissemination of knowledge and technology, in order to achieve the sustainable development of Africa and to promote the participation of all African countries in the global economy; 
	9.	Reaffirms its resolve to give greater opportunities to the private sector, non-governmental organizations and civil society in general to contribute to the realization of the goals and programmes of the United Nations and thereby to enhance opportunities and offset the negative economic and social consequences of globalization; 
	10.	Welcomes the efforts of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the International Trade Centre and other multilateral and bilateral efforts to help developing countries, including landlocked developing countries, small island developing States and, in particular, African countries and the least developed countries, in addressing their specific concerns within the globalizing economy, in particular through technology-related assistance in the fields of trade and policy, in the improvement of trade efficiency and policies and trade in services, and in electronic commerce; 
	11.	Stresses the need for good governance within each country as well as at the international level;
	12.	Emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing the specific concerns of countries with economies in transition so as to help them to benefit from globalization, with a view to their full integration into the world economy; 
	13.	Emphasizes also the technology-led dimension of globalization and the need to promote universal access to knowledge and information as well as the need to strive to bridge the digital divide and to bring information and communication technologies to the service of development and all the peoples of the world so as to enable the developing countries and the countries with economies in transition to benefit effectively from globalization by full and effective integration into the emerging global information network;

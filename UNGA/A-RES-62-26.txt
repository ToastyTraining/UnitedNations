	The General Assembly,
	Recognizing that disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation are essential for the maintenance of international peace and security,

	Recalling also that the States parties to the international disarmament and 
non-proliferation treaties have undertaken to facilitate the fullest possible exchange of materials, equipment and technological information for peaceful purposes, in accordance with the provisions of those treaties,
	Considering that the exchange of national legislation, regulations and procedures on the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology contributes to mutual understanding and confidence among Member States,
	Convinced that such an exchange would be beneficial to Member States that are in the process of developing such legislation,
	Welcoming the electronic database established by the Office for Disarmament Affairs,1 in which all information exchanged pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 57/66 of 22 November 2002, 58/42 of 8 December 2003, 59/66 of 3 December 2004 and 60/69 of 3 December 2005, entitled "National legislation on transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology", can be consulted,

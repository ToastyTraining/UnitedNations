	The General Assembly,
	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General,1
	Recalling its decision, contained in paragraph 108 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly, the first special session devoted to disarmament,2 to establish a programme of fellowships on disarmament, as well as its decisions contained in annex IV to the Concluding Document of the Twelfth Special Session of the General Assembly, the second special session devoted to disarmament,3 including its decision to continue the programme,
	Noting that the programme continues to contribute significantly to developing greater awareness of the importance and benefits of disarmament and a better understanding of the concerns of the international community in the field of disarmament and security, as well as to enhancing the knowledge and skills of fellows, allowing them to participate more effectively in efforts in the field of disarmament at all levels,
	Noting with satisfaction that the programme has trained a large number of officials from Member States throughout its 36 years of existence, many of whom hold positions of responsibility in the field of disarmament within their own Governments,

	Recalling all the resolutions on the matter since the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly, in 1982, including resolution 50/71 A of 12 December 1995,
	Believing that the forms of assistance available under the programme to Member States, in particular to developing countries, will enhance the capabilities of their officials to follow ongoing deliberations and negotiations on disarmament, both bilateral and multilateral,

	4.	Commends the Secretary-General for the diligence with which the programme has continued to be carried out;
	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to implement annually the programme within existing resources and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its seventy-first session;

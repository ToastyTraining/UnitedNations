	Taking note of the conclusions and recommendations of the seventh meeting of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, held in Sweden in May 2014, focused on the theme "Unlocking the potential of migration for inclusive development", which stressed the positive economic, social and cultural contributions of migrants to the development of the countries of origin and destination, and reiterated the importance of respect for the human rights of all migrants, regardless of their migration status,

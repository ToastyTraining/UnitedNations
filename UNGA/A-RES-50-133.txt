	5.	Encourages the Secretary-General to continue to improve the capacity of the Organization to respond effectively to the requests of Member States through coherent, adequate support of their efforts to achieve the goal of democratization;

	6.	Encourages Member States to promote democratization and to make additional efforts to identify possible steps to support the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies;


	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session a report on the implementation of the present resolution, including innovative ways and means, as well as new reflections, to enable the Organization to respond effectively and in an integrated manner to requests of Member States for assistance in this field;

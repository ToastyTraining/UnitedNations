	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Third Committee (A/48/628)]


		48/102.Prevention of the smuggling of aliens


	The General Assembly,

	Concerned that the activities of criminal organizations that profit illicitly by smuggling human beings and preying on the dignity and lives of migrants contribute to the complexity of the phenomenon of increasing international migration,

	Recognizing that international criminal groups often convince individuals to migrate illegally by various means for enormous profits and use the proceeds from smuggling human beings to finance other criminal activities, thus bringing great harm to the States concerned,

	Aware that such activities endanger the lives of those individuals and impose severe costs on the international community, particularly upon certain States that have been called upon to rescue and to provide medical care, food, housing and transportation for those individuals,

	Recognizing that socio-economic factors influence the problem of the smuggling of aliens and also contribute to the complexity of current international migration,

	Noting that smugglers, particularly in the State of destination of the smuggling of aliens, often force migrants into forms of debt, bondage or servitude, often involving criminal activities, in order to pay for their passage,

	Convinced of the need to provide humane treatment and protect the full human rights of migrants,

	Recognizing that this illegal smuggling activity has high social and economic costs, contributes to corruption and burdens law enforcement agencies in all States where illegal aliens transit or are found,

	Recalling relevant international agreements and conventions, including the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea,  1960, 1/ the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1974, 2/ and the Protocol relating thereto of 1978, 3/ by which specific safety standards are established for certain passenger ships, each State party is required to take the necessary steps to ensure that no vessel covered by the Conventions and flying its flag is permitted to carry passengers on international voyages unless it meets the standards established by the Conventions, and each port State party is required to prevent a foreign flag passenger vessel from sailing from its port when the condition of the ship or of its equipment is not in compliance with the Conventions,

	Recalling also the undertaking of States parties to the Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery, doneat Geneva on 7 September 1956, 4/ to take all practicable and necessary legislative and other measures to bring about progressively and as soon as possible the complete abolition or abandonment of the practice of debt bondage,

	Reaffirming that the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all States must be respected, including their right to control their own borders,

	Concerned that the smuggling of aliens undermines public confidence in policies and procedures for immigration and for the protection of refugees,

	Noting that the smuggling of aliens can involve criminal elements in many States, including the State or States where the smuggling scheme was planned, the State of nationality of the aliens, the State where the means of transport was prepared, the flag State of any vessels or aircraft that transport the aliens, States through which the aliens transit to their destination or in order to be repatriated and the State of destination,

	Taking into account the efforts of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organization for Migration, the International Civil Aviation Organization and the International Maritime Organization in responding to requests from States for assistance in dealing with the smuggling of aliens,

___________

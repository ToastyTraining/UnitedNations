    Taking note of the Ministerial Declaration on the South Summit3 adopted by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Group of 77 at their twenty-third annual meeting, held in New York on 24 September 1999, in which the increased importance and relevance of South-South cooperation was emphasized,

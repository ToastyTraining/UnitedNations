Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 8 December 2005
[on the report of the First Committee (A/60/463)]
          60/73.	Preventing the risk of radiological terrorism


	The General Assembly,
	Recognizing the essential contribution of radioactive materials and sources to social and economic development, and the benefits drawn from their use for all States,
	Recognizing also the determination of the international community to combat terrorism, as evident in relevant General Assembly and Security Council resolutions,
	Deeply concerned by the threat of terrorism and the risk that terrorists may acquire, traffic in or use radioactive materials or sources in radiological dispersion devices,
	Recalling the importance of international conventions aimed at preventing and suppressing such a risk, in particular the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism, adopted on 13 April 2005,1
	Noting that actions of the international community to combat the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and prevent access by non-State actors to weapons of mass destruction and related material, notably Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004, constitute contributions to the protection against nuclear and radiological terrorism,
	Stressing the importance of the role of the International Atomic Energy Agency in promoting and reinforcing the safety and security of radioactive materials and sources, in particular by supporting the improvement of national legal and regulatory infrastructure,
	Taking note of the importance of the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and on the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management2 with respect to the safety of the end of life of radioactive sources,
	Taking note also of the importance of the Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources3 as a valuable instrument for enhancing the safety and security of radioactive sources, while recognizing that the Code is not a legally binding instrument, and of the International Atomic Energy Agency Revised Action Plan for the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources4 and its Nuclear Security Plan for 2006-2009,5
	Taking note further of resolutions GC(49)/RES/9 and GC(49)/RES/10, adopted by the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency at its forty-ninth regular session, which address measures to strengthen international cooperation in nuclear, radiation and transport safety and waste management and measures to protect against nuclear and radiological terrorism,6
	Welcoming the ongoing individual and collective efforts of Member States to take into account in their deliberations the dangers posed by the lack or insufficiency of control over radioactive materials and sources, and recognizing the need for States to take more effective measures to strengthen those controls in accordance with their national legal authorities and legislation and consistent with international law,
	Welcoming also the fact that Member States have undertaken multilateral actions to address this issue, as reflected in General Assembly resolution 57/9 of 11 November 2002,
	Welcoming further the contribution of the International Atomic Energy Agency International Conference on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources: Towards a Global System for the Continuous Control of Sources throughout Their Life Cycle, held in Bordeaux, France, from 27 June to 1 July 2005, to the activities of the Agency on these issues,
	Mindful of the need for addressing, within the United Nations framework and through international cooperation, this rising concern for international security,
	1.	Calls upon Member States to support international efforts to prevent the acquisition and use by terrorists of radioactive materials and sources, and, if necessary, suppress such acts, in accordance with their national legal authorities and legislation and consistent with international law;
	2.	Urges Member States to take and strengthen national measures, as appropriate, to prevent the acquisition and use by terrorists of radioactive materials and sources as well as terrorist attacks on nuclear plants and facilities which would result in radioactive releases, and, if necessary, suppress such acts, in particular by taking effective measures to account for, secure and physically protect such high-risk materials in accordance with their international obligations;
	3.	Invites all Member States that have not yet done so to sign and ratify the International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism;1
	4.	Invites Member States to support and endorse the efforts of the International Atomic Energy Agency to enhance the safety and security of radioactive sources, as described in the Agency's Nuclear Security Plan for 
2006-2009,5 urges all States to work towards following the guidance contained in the Agency Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources,3 including, as appropriate, the guidance on the import and export of radioactive sources, noting that the guidance is complementary to the Code, and encourages Member States to notify the Director General of the Agency of their intention to do so pursuant to resolution GC(48)/RES/10 of the General Conference of the Agency,7 recognizes the value of information exchange on national approaches to controlling radioactive sources, and encourages consultations by the secretariat of the Agency with its member States with a view to establishing a formalized process for a periodic exchange of information and lessons learned and for the evaluation of progress made by States towards implementing the provisions of the Code;
	5.	Encourages cooperation among and between Member States and through relevant international and, where appropriate, regional organizations for strengthening national capacities in this regard; 
	6.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-second session an item entitled "Preventing the risk of radiological terrorism".

Notes that the agreements reached in the context of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations 9/ have established a basis for initiating a process of reform of trade in agriculture and will have an important impact on the development of food production, agro-industrial products and international markets for agricultural and tropical products and on global food security;

Notes with satisfaction the individual and collaborative efforts of the food and agricultural bodies based in Rome, namely, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food Programme, calls upon these organizations to strengthen their collaboration in the area of food and agriculture, including with the United Nations Development Programme, and welcomes the programmes of these organizations directed to food production for food security in low-income food-deficit countries, including the initiation of two special programmes of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations;

	8.	Attaches special importance to the assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to developing countries on policy transformation and technical assistance in the light of the Final Act of the Uruguay Round and in the context of the Uruguay Round decision on measures concerning the possible negative effects of the reform programme on least developed and net food-importing developing countries;

	11.	Welcomes the successful conclusion of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, particularly in Africa 10/ and hopes that the Convention will attract the support of the international community towards solving the important problem confronting, in particular, Africa in that area, and in that regard supports the contribution made by, inter alia, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the International Fund for Agricultural Development to deal with the problem of land degradation in Africa and invites those organizations to consider extending their programmes to other affected regions;

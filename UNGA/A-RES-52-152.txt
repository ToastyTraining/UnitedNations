	Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law1 and the guidelines and recommendations on future implementation of the Programme which were adopted by the Advisory Committee on the Programme and are contained in section III of that report,

	Bearing in mind that the encouragement of the teaching, study, dissemination and wider appreciation of international law is one of the main objectives of the United Nations Decade of International Law, as declared in its resolution 44/23 of 17 November 1989 and further reaffirmed and expanded in section IV of the programme for the activities for the first term (1990-1992), the second term (1993-1994), the third term (1995-1996) and the final term (1997-1999), annexed to resolutions 45/40 of 28 November 1990, 47/32 of 25 November 1992, 49/50 of 9 December 1994 and 51/157, respectively,

	Considering that international law should occupy an appropriate place in the teaching of legal disciplines at all universities,


	Noting with appreciation the efforts made by States at the bilateral level to provide assistance in the teaching and study of international law,

	Convinced, nevertheless, that States and international organizations and institutions should be encouraged to give further support to the Programme and increase their activities to promote the teaching, study, dissemination and wider appreciation of international law, in particular those activities which are of special benefit to persons from developing countries,

	Reaffirming its resolutions 2464 (XXIII) of 20 December 1968, 2550 (XXIV) of 12 December 1969, 2838 (XXVI) of 18 December 1971, 3106 (XXVIII) of 12 December 1973, 3502 (XXX) of 15 December 1975, 32/146 of 16 December 1977, 36/108 of 10 December 1981 and 38/129 of 19 December 1983, in which it stated or recalled that in the conduct of the Programme it was desirable to use as far as possible the resources and facilities made available by Member States, international organizations and others, as well as its resolutions 34/144 of 17 December 1979, 40/66 of 11 December 1985, 42/148 of 7 December 1987, 44/28 of 4 December 1989, 46/50 of 9 December 1991 and 48/29 of 9 December 1993, in which, in addition, it expressed or reaffirmed the hope that, in appointing lecturers for the seminars to be held within the framework of the fellowship programme in international law, account would be taken of the need to secure representation of major legal systems and balance among various geographical regions,

	12.	Notes with appreciation the contributions of the Hague Academy of International Law to the teaching, study, dissemination and wider appreciation of international law, and calls upon Member States and interested organizations to give favourable consideration to the appeal of the Academy for a continuation of support and a possible increase in their financial contributions, to enable the Academy to carry out its activities, particularly those relating to the summer courses, regional courses and programmes of the Centre for Studies and Research in International Law and International Relations;

	13.	Urges all States and relevant international organizations, whether regional or universal, to make all possible efforts to implement the goals and carry out the activities contemplated in section IV of the programme of activities for the final term (1997-1999) of the United Nations Decade of International Law, dealing with the encouragement of the teaching, study, dissemination and wider appreciation of international law and contained in the annex to resolution 51/157;

	17.	Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session on the implementation of the Programme during 1998 and 1999 and, following consultations with the Advisory Committee on the Programme, to submit recommendations regarding the execution of the Programme in subsequent years;

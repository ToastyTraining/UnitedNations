[on the report of the Third Committee (A/68/456/Add.2)]
68/241.	United Nations Human Rights Training and Documentation Centre for South-West Asia and the Arab Region
	The General Assembly,
	Guided by the fundamental and universal principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1
	Recalling the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action of 1993,2 which reiterated the need to consider the possibility of establishing regional and subregional arrangements for the promotion and protection of human rights where they do not already exist,
	Recalling also its resolutions 32/127 of 16 December 1977 and 51/102 of 12 December 1996 and all its subsequent resolutions concerning regional arrangements for the promotion and protection of human rights,
	Recalling further its resolutions 60/153 of 16 December 2005 and 67/162 of 20 December 2012 on the United Nations Human Rights Training and Documentation Centre for South-West Asia and the Arab Region,
	Recalling Commission on Human Rights resolution 1993/51 of 9 March 19933 and all its subsequent resolutions concerning regional arrangements for the promotion and protection of human rights,
	Reaffirming that regional cooperation plays a fundamental role in promoting and protecting human rights and should reinforce universal human rights, as contained in international human rights instruments, and their protection,
	Noting that the developments in the Middle East and North Africa have generated growing demand for the services of the Centre, and recognizing that the report of the Secretary-General4 indicates that the Centre will be unable to effectively meet these demands and fully discharge its mandate without the allocation of appropriate funding and adequate resources,
	Mindful of the vastness and the diversity of the needs in the field of human rights within South-West Asia and the Arab region, and taking into account the need for more appropriate and sustainable funding of the Centre to fully realize its significant function and crucial role in the region,
	1.	Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General;4
	2.	Notes with appreciation the successful assistance that the Centre has provided through human rights capacity-building activities, technical assistance programmes, training activities and regional consultations on the topics of United Nations human rights mechanisms, human trafficking, the media and human rights education;
	3.	Underlines the Centre's role as a source for regional expertise and the need to meet an increasing number of requests for training and documentation, including in the Arabic language, which require additional resources and the reinforcement of its activities;
	4.	Notes that the current levels of human and financial resources are limiting the Centre's capacity to respond in a timely and sustainable manner to the increasing requests to provide continuous follow-up support to the countries of the region and to appropriately respond to their needs;
	5.	Encourages the continued engagement of the Centre to work with other United Nations regional offices to strengthen its work and to avoid duplication;
	6.	Reaffirms the request contained in paragraph 5 of its resolution 67/162, and endorses the proposal of the Secretary-General to strengthen the Centre, as proposed in his report, with the costs to be borne by the regular budget and extrabudgetary resources, as recommended by the Secretary-General, in order to ensure the full implementation of the mandate of the Centre;
	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session a report, in accordance with existing rules and procedures, on the implementation of the present resolution.

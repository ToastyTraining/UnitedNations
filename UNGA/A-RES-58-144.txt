[on the report of the Third Committee (A/58/501)]
58/144.	Improvement of the status of women in the United Nations system 


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling Articles 1 and 101 of the Charter of the United Nations, as well as Article 8, which provides that the United Nations shall place no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs,
	Recalling also the goal, contained in the Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women,1 of achieving overall gender equality, particularly at the Professional level and above, by 2000 and the further actions and initiatives set out in the outcome document adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-third special session, entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century",2 
	Recalling further its resolution 57/180 of 18 December 2002, as well as its resolution 57/305 of 15 April 2003, in particular section II, paragraphs 39 to 41 thereof,
	Taking note of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2003/44 of 23 April 2003 on integrating the human rights of women throughout the United Nations system,3 in particular paragraph 15 thereof, in which the Commission recognized that gender mainstreaming would strongly benefit from the enhanced and full participation of women, including at the higher levels of decision-making within the United Nations system,
	Taking into account the continuing lack of representation or underrepresentation of women from certain countries, in particular from developing countries, including least developed countries and small island developing States, from countries with economies in transition and from unrepresented or largely underrepresented Member States,
	Noting with appreciation the efforts of the Office of Programme Planning, Budget and Accounts, the Office of Human Resources Management, the Department of Public Information, the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management and the Executive Office of the Secretary-General and the United Nations Institute for Training and Research in achieving or maintaining the goal of gender balance, as well as those departments and offices that have met or exceeded the goal of 50 per cent in the selection of women candidates for vacant posts in the past year,
	Expressing particular concern that, for the second consecutive year, there was a slowing of progress towards achieving the target of 50/50 gender balance and that between 1998 and 2003 there has been almost no progress in the rate of representation of women in appointments of one year or more at the Professional and higher levels,
	Expressing concern that there is still only one female special representative of the Secretary-General,
	Welcoming the work of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of the Secretariat in issuing guidance for field missions on the procedures to be followed for handling disciplinary issues and allegations of serious misconduct involving mission personnel, and encouraged by the agreement in the Staff-Management Coordination Committee that the procedure for dealing with all forms of sexual harassment will be reviewed and incorporated in a new administrative instruction covering all forms of harassment,
	Welcoming also the new flexible working arrangements authorized in all departments and offices of the Secretariat,4
	Noting with concern that the statistics on the representation of women in some organizations of the United Nations system are not fully up to date,

	4.	Expresses concern that in three departments and offices of the Secretariat women still account for less than 30 per cent of professional staff and that in three organizations of the United Nations system women still account for less than 20 per cent of professional staff, and encourages the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the organizations of the United Nations system to intensify their efforts to meet the goal of gender balance within the United Nations system;

	(g)	The formulation of a project by the Office of the Under-Secretary-General for Management to strengthen the efforts of the Secretary-General to achieve gender balance by adopting a more coordinated and integrated approach to this issue, with the purpose of setting and achieving verifiable goals to ensure that gender balance targets are attained by 2006;
	(h)	The preparation of a research-based analysis by the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, to be presented to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session, of the probable causes of the slow advancement in the improvement of the status of women in the United Nations system, with a view to elaborating new strategies for achieving gender parity;
	(i)	The commitment of the Office of Human Resources Management and the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women to explore ways to better integrate the departmental focal points in the new staffing system, so that the focal points can continue to play an important role for the periodic and systematic monitoring of the recruitment, retention and career advancement of women,8 and looks forward to information on this matter in the next report;

Strongly encourages the Secretary-General, in the context of his commitment to set concrete targets for the appointment of women as his special representatives and special envoys in order to reach the target of 50/50 gender balance by 2015,9 to intensify his efforts to appoint more women as special representatives and envoys to pursue good offices on his behalf, especially in matters related to peacekeeping, peace-building, preventive diplomacy and economic and social development, as well as in operational activities, including appointment as resident coordinators, and to appoint more women to other high-level positions;

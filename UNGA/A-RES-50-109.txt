	Recognizing that activities to ensure food security at all levels should be carried out within the framework of sustainable development, as defined in Agenda 21, 9/ and that the World Food Summit will give due attention to the multifaceted nature of food security,

	4.	Invites the international community to make contributions on a voluntary basis to the special trust fund established by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in order to facilitate the preparations for and the holding of the Summit as well as to facilitate the preparations for effective participation of representatives of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, both at the sessions of the Committee on World Food Security of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to be held in January and September 1996 as preparatory meetings and at the Summit itself;

	5.	Invites the Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to submit to the General Assembly, at its fifty-second session, through the Economic and Social Council, a report on the outcome of the Summit, including actions to be taken to follow up the outcome of the Summit at all appropriate levels.

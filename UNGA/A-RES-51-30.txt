	Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti, which is included in the list of least developed countries, are constrained by the extremes of the local climate, in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989 and 1994 and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes, as well as of the demobilization programme, requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country,

	Noting with concern that the situation in Djibouti has been made worse by the deteriorating situation in the Horn of Africa and in particular in Somalia, and noting the presence of tens of thousands of refugees and persons displaced from their countries, which has, on the one hand, placed serious strains on the fragile economic, social and administrative infrastructure of Djibouti and, on the other, caused serious security problems in the country,

	Noting the difficult economic and financial situation of Djibouti resulting in part from the number of priority development projects that have had to be suspended in view of serious developments in the international situation and in part from the prolonged effects of the previous regional conflicts, notably in Somalia, which have disrupted services, transport and trade and which are draining the State of most of its revenues,

	Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti has begun to implement the structural adjustment programme, and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences, in particular the social consequences, of that adjustment policy, which is in the course of implementation, in order that the country may achieve appreciable economic results,

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to mobilize the resources necessary for an effective programme of financial, technical and material assistance to Djibouti;

	Noting also that the unfavourable situation of the Comoros, which is on the list of least developed countries, is aggravated by several important factors, including its physical distance from its trading partners, the scarcity of natural resources, the diminutive size of the domestic market, the fall in prices of its export products and the poverty of its soil,

	Noting further the economic and social trauma caused by that invasion and the material and structural damage suffered by the country during those events,

	Aware of the efforts made by the Government and people of the Comoros to assist the most affected and deprived sectors of the population,

	Considering, in particular, that in order to respond to those urgent humanitarian needs the Government of the Comoros, in the absence of other resources, had to reallocate as a matter of great urgency the major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State and the financial resources normally devoted to vital economic and social programmes,

	Noting, nonetheless, the insufficiency of means available to the Government to execute programmes of reconstruction and development essential for the survival of the country,

	1.	Expresses its gratitude to the States and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations which have provided assistance to the Government of the Comoros for the rehabilitation of the country, and appeals for the continuation of such assistance;

	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General12 on assistance for humanitarian relief and the economic and social rehabilitation of Somalia,

	Deeply appreciative of the humanitarian assistance and rehabilitation support rendered by a number of States to alleviate the hardship and suffering of the affected Somali population,

	Recognizing that, while the humanitarian situation remains fragile in some parts, there is a need to continue the ongoing process of rehabilitation and reconstruction alongside the process of national reconciliation, without prejudice to the provision of emergency relief assistance wherever and whenever required, as security allows,

	Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system focusing on working directly with Somali communities, whenever possible, in the absence of a recognized national government, and welcoming the efforts of the United Nations, in partnership with Somali counterparts at the local level and non-governmental organizations, to formulate a programme combining humanitarian and developmental approaches, given the varying conditions in different areas of the country,

	5.	Emphasizes the principle that the Somali people, in particular at the local level, have the primary responsibility for their own development and for the sustainability of rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance programmes, and reaffirms the importance it attaches to the creation of workable arrangements for collaboration between the United Nations system and its partner organizations and their Somali counterparts at the local level for the effective execution of rehabilitation and development activities in those parts of the country where peace and security prevail;

	6.	Urges all States and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to continue the further implementation of its resolution 47/160 so as to assist the Somali people to embark on the rehabilitation of basic social and economic services, as well as institution-building aimed at the restoration of civil administration at the local level in all those parts of the country where peace, security and stability prevail;

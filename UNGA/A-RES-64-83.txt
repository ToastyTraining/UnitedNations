	Noting further that in 1991 the Secretary-General, with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme, established the Trust Fund for Peace consisting of voluntary contributions in order to provide the University with the means necessary to extend its sphere of activity to the whole world, taking full advantage of its potential capacity for education, research and support of the United Nations and to carry out its mandate of promoting peace in the world,
	Considering the importance of promoting education for peace that fosters respect for the values inherent in peace and universal co-existence among people, including respect for the life, dignity and integrity of human beings, as well as friendship and solidarity among peoples irrespective of their nationality, race, sex, religion or culture,

	3.	Also requests the Secretary-General to continue using the services of the University as part of his conflict-resolution and peacebuilding efforts through the training of staff, especially those concerned with peacekeeping and peacebuilding, in order to strengthen their capacities in this area, and in the promotion of the Declaration and the Programme of Action on a Culture of Peace;3

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/49/817/Add.1)]


49/235.Financing of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Recalling Security Council resolution 797 (1992) of 16 December 1992, by which the Council established the United Nations Operation in Mozambique, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Operation, the latest of which were resolutions 957 (1994) of 15 November 1994 and 960 (1994) of 21 November 1994,

	Recalling also its resolutions 47/224 A and B of 16 March 1993 on the financing of the Operation and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which were resolution 48/240 B of 29 July 1994 and decision 49/467 of 23 December 1994,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Operation are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Operation, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,


	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Operation with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Operation in Mozambique as at 28 February 1995, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 62,831,938 United States dollars, and urges all Member States concerned to make every possible effort to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peace-keeping activities, particularly in regard to the reimbursement of troop- and equipment-contributing countries, due to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments, particularly Member States in arrears;

	3.	Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Operation promptly and in full;

	4.	Expresses deep concern at the late submission of documentation, in particular the financial performance report for the period from 1 May to 15 November 1994;

	5.	Expresses concern at delays in the processing and settlement of claims for the reimbursement of the cost of the contingent-owned equipment provided by troop-contributing countries;

	6.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions; 2/

	7.	Expresses deep concern that the failure of Member States to pay their assessed contributions promptly and in full threatens to leave the Special Account for the United Nations Operation in Mozambique with insufficient liquid funds to meet its liabilities, in particular, to the troop-contributing countries;

	8.	Requests the Secretary-General to explore all possibilities in order to ensure prompt reimbursement to troop- and equipment-contributing countries;

	9.	Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Operation in Mozambique a total amount of 40 million dollars gross (39,053,300 dollars net) for the liquidation of the Operation for the period from 16 November 1994 to 31 March 1995, inclusive of the commitment authority of 25 million dollars authorized under the provisions of General Assembly resolution 48/240 B, with the prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee;

	10.

	11.	Decides further that, in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955, there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 10 above, their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated staff assessment income of 946,700 dollars approved for the period from 16 November 1994 to 31 March 1995; 320,200 dollars being the amount pertaining on a pro rata basis to the period ending 31 December 1994, and the balance, that is, 626,500 dollars, for the period from 1 January to 31 March 1995;

	13.	Decides also that the disposition of the assets of the Operation shall proceed on the basis of the following principles and policies, listed in order of priority, and requests the Secretary-General to proceed with the disposition accordingly:

	(a)	All equipment that meets the requirements of other United Nations operations and that it is cost-effective to move shall be redeployed to such operations or held in reserve for use by future operations;

	(b)	Other equipment shall be transferred to United Nations organizations, as well as to national and international non-governmental organizations already operating in Mozambique or in the process of establishing a presence there, upon request and against appropriate credit to the Special Account for the United Nations Operation in Mozambique;

	(c)	Any remaining material that cannot be moved shall be sold commercially on an "as is, where is" basis in accordance with standard United Nations procedures; 

	(d)	Assets or installations that cannot be dismantled, including airfield installations, shall be donated to the Government of Mozambique;

	14.	Decides further to accept the proposal of the Secretary-General to donate certain assets to the mine-clearance programme on the understanding that it is not cost-effective to move them and that they cannot be financed through the voluntary contributions;


	15.	Takes note of the comments of the Advisory Committee in paragraph 26 of its report, 2/ and of the fact that the feasibility of procedures for valuation and transfer of costs for the assets of the Operation will be reconsidered during the discussion of the report of the Secretary-General requested by the General Assembly in its resolution 49/233 of 23 December 1994, to be submitted no later than 31 March 1995, and affirms that any decision on the methodology of the transfer of such costs of the Operation will be taken accordingly;

	Recalling further section I.A of its resolution 50/208 of 23 December 1995, by which it decided to defer consideration of the Noblemaire principle and its application and requested the International Civil Service Commission to review the recommendations and conclusions contained in chapter III.A of its twenty-first annual report,6 taking into account the views expressed by Member States at the fiftieth session of the General Assembly, in particular regarding the appropriateness of the reduction of dominance and the treatment of bonuses in determining net remuneration comparisons,

	Recalling also that, by section I.C, paragraph 3, of its resolution 44/198, it had endorsed the methodological approach for the calculation of the net remuneration margin as outlined in paragraph 173 (d) of volume II of the fifteenth annual report of the Commission,8

	Recalling further section VIII of its resolution 46/191 A of 20 December 1991, by which the Commission was invited to pursue, as a matter of priority, its review of merit systems and performance appraisal in the United Nations common system as a vehicle for enhancing productivity and cost-effectiveness, as well as section VII of its resolution 49/223 of 23 December 1994,

	2.	Reaffirms that the range of 110 to 120, with a desirable mid-point of 115, for the margin between net remuneration of officials in the Professional and higher categories of the United Nations in New York and officials in comparable positions in the United States federal civil service should continue to apply, on the understanding that the margin would be maintained at a level around the desirable mid-point of 115 over a period of time;

	3.

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to make operational proposals to the General Assembly by 1 October 1997, for its consideration at its fifty-second session, on the possibility of introducing a system of performance awards or bonuses, in the context of the performance appraisal system, to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year;

	7.	Invites the executive heads of the organizations of the United Nations common system to develop and submit proposals to their relevant intergovernmental bodies, as a matter of priority, on the possibility of introducing performance awards or bonuses to a limited number of staff in recognition of their outstanding performance and specific achievements in a given year, and to coordinate, to the extent possible, these proposals with those developed by the Secretary-General;

	Recalling further its request in section I.B, paragraph 2, of its resolution 50/208, regarding the establishment in 1996, in respect of staff members whose duty station is Geneva, of a single post adjustment index which is fully representative of the cost of living of all staff working in the duty station and which ensures equality of treatment with staff in other headquarters duty stations,

	Recalling that, in section XIV of its resolution 45/241 of 21 December 1990, the General Assembly had requested the International Civil Service Commission to consider, inter alia, the relativities between the terms and conditions of service of staff in the Professional and higher categories and those in other categories,

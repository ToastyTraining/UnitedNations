	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/52/941)]


52/245.Financing of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

	Recalling Security Council resolutions 983 (1995) of 31 March 1995, by which the Council decided that the United Nations Protection Force within the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be known as the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force, and 1142 (1997) of 4 December 1997, by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force for a final period, until 31 August 1998,

	Recalling also its decision 50/481 of 11 April 1996 on the financing of the Force and its subsequent resolutions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 51/154 B of 13 June 1997,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Force are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,


	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force by certain Governments,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force as at 15 May 1998, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 11.3 million United States dollars, representing 9 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Force to the period ending 30 June 1998, notes that some 20 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

	4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Force in full and on time;

	5.	Takes note of the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;2

	6.	Decides to examine the recommendation of the Advisory Committee for 5 per cent across-the-board reductions of the budget proposals of the Secretary-General in the light of the next series of relevant financial performance reports;

	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Force is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

	8.	Also requests the Secretary-General, in order to reduce the cost of employing General Service staff, to continue efforts to employ locally recruited staff for the Force against General Service posts, commensurate with the requirements of the Force;


	9.	Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force the amount of 21,053,745 dollars gross (20,580,245 dollars net) for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, inclusive of the amount of 1,053,745 dollars for the support account for peacekeeping operations, to be apportioned, as an ad hoc arrangement, among Member States in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of its resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996, 51/218 A to C of 18 December 1996 and 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and 50/451 B of 23 December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the years 1998 and 1999, as set out in its resolution 52/215 A of 22 December 1997;

	10.	Decides also that, in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955, there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 9 above, their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated staff assessment income of 473,500 dollars approved for the Force for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999;

	11.	Decides further that, for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force, there shall be set off against the apportionment, as provided for in paragraph 9 above, their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 1,264,400 dollars gross (560,300 dollars net) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1997;

	12.	Decides that, for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force, their share of the unencumbered balance of 1,264,400 dollars gross (560,300 dollars net) for the period ending 30 June 1997 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations;

	13.	Invites voluntary contributions to the Force in cash and in the form of services and supplies acceptable to the Secretary-General, to be administered, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedure and practices established by the General Assembly;

	14.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-third session the item entitled "Financing of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force".

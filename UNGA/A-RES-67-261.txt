contributing countries and other related issues
	The General Assembly, 
	Recalling section VI of its resolution 65/289 of 30 June 2011, 
	Having considered the report of the Senior Advisory Group established pursuant to General Assembly resolution 65/289 to consider rates of reimbursement to troop-contributing countries and other related issues,1 the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the report of the Senior Advisory Group2 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,3 
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Senior Advisory Group1 and the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the report of the Senior Advisory Group;2
	2.	Endorses the conclusions and recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;3
	3.	Approves the conclusions and recommendations (which are summarized in section IV) in the report of the Senior Advisory Group, and requests the Secretary-General to ensure their implementation in accordance with the provisions of the present resolution, as set forth in sections I and II below; 

I
Rotation
	4.	Notes that the establishment of a typical rotation period for contingent personnel does not infringe upon the authority of contributing countries to decide on the frequency of rotation for their units deployed to United Nations peacekeeping missions; 
	5.	Decides, upon the request of any troop- or police-contributing country that currently contributes less than 3 per cent of contingent personnel (as deployed as at 31 December 2012) to United Nations peacekeeping, to exempt from the application of the recommendation contained in paragraph 108 (b) of the report of the Senior Advisory Group individual units currently deployed with rotation periods shorter than 12 months, and permits those units to maintain their existing rotation arrangements with the United Nations until 30 June 2015; 
	6.	Also decides to exempt the rotation of naval forces from the recommendation contained in paragraph 108 (b) of the report of the Senior Advisory Group upon the request of the individual troop-contributing country; 
	7.	Recalls that, as summarized in paragraph 108 (b) of its report, the Senior Advisory Group recommended that the Secretary-General may determine operational circumstances and requirements that may demand rotation periods shorter than 12 months, and in that regard requests the Secretary-General, after considering comments received from troop- and police-contributing countries and other Member States, including, inter alia, on how to address existing legal impediments, to submit to the General Assembly prior to the conclusion of the second part of its resumed sixty-seventh session a report setting out the criteria by which he would make such determinations in the future; 

II
Absent or non-functional major equipment
	8.	Recalls that the vast majority of peacekeeping personnel in the field are performing with great diligence and professionalism, enduring hardship and danger in the cause of peace; 
	9.	Notes that each deployed unit may operate under a separate memorandum of understanding if so requested by the troop- or police-contributing country; 
	10.	Stresses that the evaluation of contingent-owned equipment and its impact on the ability of the unit to perform its duties should be on the unit basis; 
	11.	Recalls paragraphs 11 to 14 of the report of the Secretary-General, and requests the Secretary-General to implement the recommendation contained in paragraph 108 (c) of the report of the Senior Advisory Group with the following considerations:
	(a)	No deduction will be applied until after two consecutive unsatisfactory quarterly contingent-owned equipment verification reports, and in any case not before 31 October 2013, in order to provide contributing countries with sufficient opportunity to address shortfalls; 
	(b)	No deduction will be made for major equipment that is absent or non-functional for reasons deemed by the Secretariat to be beyond the control of the troop- or police-contributing country; 
	(c)	No deduction will be made related to absent or non-functional vehicles unless over 10 per cent of the vehicles specified in relevant memorandums of understanding are absent or non-functional; 
	(d)	Deduction on account of absent or non-functional contingent-owned equipment shall not exceed 35 per cent of reimbursements for any unit in any case; 
	12.	Requests the Secretary-General to notify expeditiously the permanent missions of troop- and police-contributing countries, in writing, in the case of absent or non-functional equipment, as specified in the relevant memorandums of understanding, with a description of absent or non-functional equipment and its associated contingent, in order for troop- and police-contributing countries to undertake corrective measures to fulfil their obligations in this regard.

	Recalling that the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes, inter alia, that middle-income countries still face significant challenges to achieve sustainable development and that, in order to ensure that achievements made to date are sustained, efforts to address ongoing challenges should be strengthened through the exchange of experiences, improved coordination and better and focused support of the United Nations development system, the international financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders,

	Reaffirming that the fundamental characteristics of the operational activities for development of the United Nations system should be, inter alia, their universal, voluntary and grant nature, their neutrality and their multilateralism, as well as their ability to respond to the development needs of programme countries in a flexible manner, and that the operational activities are carried out for the benefit of programme countries, at their request and in accordance with their own policies and priorities for development,
	Emphasizing that there is no "one size fits all" approach to development and that development assistance by the United Nations development system should respond to the varying development needs of programme countries, including the development needs of middle-income countries, and should be aligned with their national development plans and strategies in accordance with its mandates, keeping in mind the needs of the least developed countries,

	Recalling the resolve of Member States to enhance and strengthen domestic resource mobilization and fiscal space, including, where appropriate, through modernized tax systems, more efficient tax collection, the broadening of the tax base and the effective combating of tax evasion and capital flight, and reiterating that, while each country is responsible for its tax system, it is important to support national efforts in these areas by strengthening technical assistance and enhancing international cooperation and participation in addressing international tax matters,
	Recognizing the need to better understand the multidimensional nature of development and poverty, and acknowledging the significant role that the United Nations system has played and should continue to play in this regard,

	Expressing concern about the adverse impact and consequences of the world financial and economic crisis, including on development, and evidence of an uneven, fragile and slow recovery, cognizant that the global economy, notwithstanding significant efforts that helped to contain tail risks, improve financial market conditions and stability and sustain recovery, still remains in a challenging phase, with downside risks, including high volatility in global markets, falling commodity prices, high unemployment, particularly among young people, unsustainable debt in some countries and widespread fiscal strains, which pose challenges for global economic recovery and reflect the need for additional progress towards sustaining and rebalancing global demand, and stressing the need for continuing efforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances and to reform and strengthen the international financial system while implementing the reforms agreed upon to date,

	7.

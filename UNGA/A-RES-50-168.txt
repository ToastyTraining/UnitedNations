	Noting the large numbers of women from developing countries and from some countries with economies in transition who continue to venture forth to more affluent countries in search of a living for themselves and their families, as a consequence of poverty, unemployment and other socio-economic conditions, while acknowledging the primary duty of States to work for conditions that provide employment and security to their citizens,

	Concerned by the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against the persons of women migrant workers by some employers in some host countries,

	5.	Reiterates the need for States concerned, specifically the sending and receiving States of women migrant workers, to conduct regular consultations for the purpose of identifying problem areas in promoting and protecting the rights of women migrant workers and ensuring health, legal and social services for them, adopting specific measures to address these problems, setting up, as necessary, linguistically and culturally accessible services and mechanisms to implement these measures and, in general, creating conditions that foster greater harmony and tolerance between women migrant workers and the rest of the society in which they reside;

	6.	Encourages Member States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families, 12/ as well as the Slavery Convention of 1926; 13/

	10.	Invites trade unions to support the realization of the rights of women migrant workers by assisting them in organizing themselves so as to enable them better to assert their rights;

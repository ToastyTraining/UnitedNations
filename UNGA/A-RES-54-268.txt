	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	54/268.  Financing of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara

    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara1 and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

    Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 690 (1991) of 29 April 1991, by which the Council established the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Mission, the latest of which was resolution 1301 (2000) of 31 May 2000,

    Recalling its resolution 45/266 of 17 May 1991 on the financing of the Mission and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 53/18 B of 8 June 1999,

    Reaffirming that the costs of the Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

    Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,


    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Mission,

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

    1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara as at 30 April 2000, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 77.2 million United States dollars, representing 19 per cent of the total assessed contributions, notes that some 3 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

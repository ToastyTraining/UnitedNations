	Expansion of the membership of the Conference on Disarmament

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Conference on Disarmament1 and in particular the section concerning the expansion of the membership of the Conference,

	Stressing the role of the Conference on Disarmament as the sole multilateral global negotiating body on disarmament,

	Convinced that a more representative membership of the Conference on Disarmament from among the United Nations would contribute to the more effective pursuit of disarmament goals affecting the entire international community,

	Recalling that, since 1978, when agreement was reached at the first special session of the General Assembly devoted to disarmament that the membership of the then Committee on Disarmament would be reviewed at regular intervals, there have been thirty-seven applications for membership in the Conference,


	Recalling also that, in 1993, the Special Coordinator for Membership of the Conference on Disarmament proposed that twenty-three applicants for membership should be admitted to the Conference and proposed further that a dynamic solution to the question of membership should be pursued,

	Recalling further decision CD/1406 of the Conference on Disarmament, adopted at its 739th plenary meeting on 17 June 1996, admitting twenty-three countries as members of the Conference,2 

	Recalling its resolution 50/72 C of 12 December 1995, adopted without a vote, in which it urged that, following the presentation of progress reports by the President of the Conference, the other applicants to date be further considered by the Conference at its 1996 session,

	Noting the request of the Conference on Disarmament that its President continue consultations on a further expansion of its membership and report to it at the beginning of its 1997 session,

	1.	Recognizes the legitimate aspirations of all countries that have applied for membership to participate fully in the work of the Conference on Disarmament;

	2.	Calls upon the Conference on Disarmament to consider all remaining applications for membership with a view to reaching a decision on its further enlargement before the end of its 1997 session.

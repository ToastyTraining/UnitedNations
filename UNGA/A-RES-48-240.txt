	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/48/821/Add.2)]


	48/240.Financing of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Operation in Mozambique 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 797 (1992) of 16 December 1992, by which the Council established the United Nations Operation in Mozambique, and Council resolution 882 (1993)
of 5 November 1993, by which the Council extended the mandate of the
Operation in Mozambique until 30 April 1994,

	Bearing in mind also Security Council resolution 898 (1994) of 23 February 1994, by which the Council authorized the establishment of a police component as an integral part of the Operation in Mozambique,

	Recalling its resolutions 47/224 A and B of 16 March 1993 and 47/224 C of 14 September 1993 and its decision 48/473 A of 23 December 1993 on the financing of the Operation in Mozambique,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Operation in Mozambique are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

          

	1/	A/48/849.

	2/	A/48/889.

	Recalling its previous decision regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Operation in Mozambique, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Operation in Mozambique with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Expresses concern about the deteriorating financial situation with regard to peace-keeping activities due to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments, particularly Member States in arrears;

	2.	Expresses deep concern about the adverse effect that the deteriorating financial situation has on reimbursement to troop contributors, placing an additional burden on these countries and putting at risk the continuing supply of troops to the United Nations Operation in Mozambique and, consequently, the effective implementation of its mandate;

	3.	Reaffirms its resolution 48/227 of 23 December 1993 and stresses the need for the Secretariat to submit budget documents in time in order to allow for a proper and thorough review and approval by the General Assembly of the budgets before their implementation;

	4.	Notes with satisfaction an improvement in the compliance by the Secretariat with certain resolutions of the General Assembly with regard to the form of budget documents concerning peace-keeping operations;

	5.	Reaffirms the importance of the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions as an advisory body to the General Assembly in the budget process;

	6.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee, 2/ subject to the provisions of the present resolution;

	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Operation in Mozambique is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy and, in particular, to implement fully economy, financial and efficiency measures to be approved during the resumed forty-eighth session but no later than 1 May 1994, and to report on the implementation of such measures in the context of the performance report relevant to the period;

	8.	Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Operation in Mozambique promptly and in full;

	9.	Affirms:

	(a)	That among other factors, the non- and late payment of assessed contributions in full and on time has damaged and continues to damage the ability of the Operation in Mozambique to implement its activities effectively;

	(b)	That it expects that it will not be asked to take any future decisions on budgets for peace-keeping operations retroactively;

	10.	Requests the Secretary-General to explore all possibilities in order to ensure prompt reimbursement to troop-contributing countries, and endorses the request to the Secretary-General contained in paragraph 3 of Security Council resolution 898 (1994), as the police contingent in the Operation in Mozambique is being deployed, to begin immediately preparing specific proposals for the drawdown of an appropriate number of military personnel with the objective of ensuring that there is no increase in the cost of the Operation, without prejudice to the effective discharge of its mandate;

	11.	Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Operation in Mozambique a total amount of 161,799,100 United States dollars gross (159,462,400 dollars net) for the Operation in Mozambique for the period from 1 November 1993 to 30 April 1994, inclusive;

	12.	Decides also, as an ad hoc arrangement, to apportion the additional amount of 100,067,600 dollars gross (99,462,400 dollars net) for the period from 1 November 1993 to 30 April 1994, taking into account the amount of 61,731,500 dollars gross (60 million dollars net) already apportioned in accordance with General Assembly decision 48/473 A among Member States in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992 and its decision 48/472 A of 23 December 1993, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the years 1992, 1993 and 1994 as set out in Assembly resolutions 46/221 A of 20 December 1991 and 48/223 A of 23 December 1993 and Assembly decision 47/456 of 23 December 1992;

	13.	Decides further that, in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955, there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 12 above, their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated additional staff assessment income of 605,200 dollars for the period from 1 November 1993 to 30 April 1994 approved for the Operation in Mozambique;

	16.	Requests the Secretary-General:

	(a)	To submit by 1 June 1994 full cost estimates for the period the Security Council might have decided to continue the mandate of the Operation in Mozambique beyond 30 April 1994, incorporating the financial implications of such action as the Council may wish to take following the progress report of the Secretary-General to the Council in April 1994 called for in paragraph 13 of Council resolution 882 (1993);

	(b)	To keep under review existing commitment authority levels in the light of the establishment of the civilian police component and, if appropriate, to make further proposals in that respect;

	17.	Invites voluntary contributions to the Operation in Mozambique in cash and in the form of services and supplies acceptable to the Secretary-General, to be administered, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedure established by the General Assembly in its resolutions 43/230 of 21 December 1988, 44/192 A of 21 December 1989 and 45/258 of 3 May 1991;

		52/196.Developing human resources for development


The General Assembly,

	Reaffirming its resolutions 50/105 of 20 December 1995, 48/205 of 21 December 1993, 46/143 of 17 December 1991 and 45/191 of 21 December 1990, as well as the relevant sections of the Agenda for Development,1

	Recognizing that people are at the centre of concerns for sustainable development and that the development of human resources is an essential component in the achievement of sustainable development, and stressing that effective human resources development should strengthen people's capabilities and competencies and enlarge the choices available to them in developing their lives and fulfilling their aspirations so as to reach total human development,

	Recognizing also that there is a need to integrate human resources development into comprehensive strategies that mainstream a gender perspective, taking into account the needs of all people, in particular, the needs of women and the girl child,

	Stressing that Governments have the primary responsibility for defining and implementing appropriate policies for human resources development and that there is a need for continued support from the international community to complement the efforts of Governments of developing countries to promote human resources development in pursuit of their national programmes, plans and strategies for development,

	Stressing also that there is a need for a supportive and favourable national and international economic environment that will enhance human resources development in developing countries and promote sustained economic growth and sustainable development, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences,


	Recognizing that economic reforms and structural adjustment programmes are aimed at benefiting those countries which undertake them but that these programmes can also affect the capacity of Governments to implement appropriate policies that promote human resources development, and that there is a need, in the formulation of these programmes, to continue to integrate measures that mitigate such an effect,

	Recognizing also the vital role of South-South cooperation in supporting national efforts at human resources development,

	Emphasizing the continued need for coordination and integration among the organs and organizations of the United Nations system in assisting developing countries, in particular the least developed among them, to foster the development of their human resources, especially that of the most vulnerable, and for the United Nations to continue to give priority to human resources development in developing countries,

	Recognizing the importance accorded to the human component of development in the declarations and programmes of action adopted at all the major United Nations conferences and summits since 1990,

	1.	Takes note of the note by the Secretary-General;2

	2.	Emphasizes that, in the development of human resources, an overall, well-conceived and integrated approach that mainstreams a gender perspective and takes into account the needs of all people should be adopted, incorporating such vital areas as population, health, nutrition, water, sanitation, housing, communications, education and training, and science and technology, as well as taking into account the need to create more opportunities for employment in an environment that guarantees political freedom, popular participation, respect for human rights, justice and equity, all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development;

	3.	Encourages all countries to apply the requisite policies to ensure the development of their human resources, through education and training and by seeking, where possible, to increase receptivity to technological innovations, including those in the field of information technology;

	4.	Emphasizes the need to ensure the full participation of women in the formulation and implementation of national policies to promote human resources development;

	5.	Acknowledges the efforts of developing countries in promoting human resources development, and, in this regard, emphasizes the need for international cooperation to advance human resources development and the need for concerted efforts to support the efforts of developing countries, especially in those Africa and the least developed countries, to develop their human resources;

	6.	Encourages all countries to accord priority, in particular in national budgets, to human resources development in the context of the adoption of economic and social policies;

	7.	Emphasizes that human resources development and institution-building can be promoted through South-South cooperation, and calls upon countries to take action in this regard;

	8.	Invites international organizations, including international financial institutions, to continue to give priority to supporting the objectives of human resources development and to integrating them into their policies, programmes and operations;

	9.	Emphasizes that structural adjustment programmes should support social development goals, in particular the eradication of poverty, the promotion of full and productive employment and the enhancement of social integration, with due regard to the implementation of sound economic policies;


	10.	Calls upon the relevant organs, organizations and bodies of the United Nations system, in accordance with their mandates, work programmes and priorities, to coordinate effectively their activities in support of national and regional action in the area of human resources development and capacity-building, both among themselves and with other development partners, and to strengthen the impact of their development activities on human resources development;

	11.	Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session an assessment of the effectiveness of the contribution made by the United Nations system to advance human resources development through its operational activities, and to make recommendations to further enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of its contribution to human resources development, including the identification of possible new approaches that will enhance their impact;

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 2 December 2008
[on the report of the First Committee (A/63/390)]
63/79.	United Nations disarmament fellowship, training and advisory services


	The General Assembly,
	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General,1
	Recalling its decision, contained in paragraph 108 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly,2 the first special session devoted to disarmament, to establish a programme of fellowships on disarmament, as well as its decisions contained in annex IV to the Concluding Document of the Twelfth Special Session of the General Assembly,3 the second special session devoted to disarmament, in which it decided, inter alia, to continue the programme,
	Noting that the programme continues to contribute significantly to developing greater awareness of the importance and benefits of disarmament and a better understanding of the concerns of the international community in the field of disarmament and security, as well as to enhancing the knowledge and skills of fellows, allowing them to participate more effectively in efforts in the field of disarmament at all levels,
	Noting with satisfaction that the programme has trained a large number of officials from Member States throughout its thirty years of existence, many of whom hold positions of responsibility in the field of disarmament within their own Governments,
	Recognizing the need for Member States to take into account gender equality when nominating candidates to the programme,
	Recalling all the annual resolutions on the matter since the thirty-seventh session of the General Assembly, in 1982, including resolution 50/71 A of 12 December 1995,
	Believing that the forms of assistance available to Member States, in particular to developing countries, under the programme will enhance the capabilities of their officials to follow ongoing deliberations and negotiations on disarmament, both bilateral and multilateral,
	1.	Reaffirms its decisions contained in annex IV to the Concluding Document of the Twelfth Special Session of the General Assembly3 and the report of the Secretary-General4 approved by the Assembly in its resolution 33/71 E of 14 December 1978;
	2.	Expresses its appreciation to all Member States and organizations that have consistently supported the programme throughout the years, thereby contributing to its success, in particular to the Governments of Germany and Japan for the continuation of extensive and highly educative study visits for the participants in the programme, to the Government of the People's Republic of China for organizing a study visit for the fellows in the area of disarmament in 2007 and to the Government of Switzerland for organizing a study visit in 2008;
	3.	Expresses its appreciation to the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, the Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization and the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies of the Monterey Institute of International Studies for having organized specific study programmes in the field of disarmament in their respective areas of competence, thereby contributing to the objectives of the programme;
	4.	Commends the Secretary-General for the diligence with which the programme has continued to be carried out;
	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to implement annually the Geneva-based programme within existing resources and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its sixty-fifth session;

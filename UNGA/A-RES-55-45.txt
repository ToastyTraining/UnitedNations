	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General,3
	Welcoming the implementation of the main provisions of the General Agreement on the Establishment of Peace and National Accord in Tajikistan,4
	Recognizing with satisfaction that the United Nations has played a successful and important role in the peace process and was instrumental in assisting the negotiation and implementation processes conducted under its aegis, believing that the United Nations should continue the assistance to Tajikistan in post-conflict peace-building, and welcoming in this regard the establishment of the United Nations Tajikistan Office for Peace-building, 
	Noting with satisfaction the efforts of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan, which should be regarded as a successful operation, supported by the Contact Group of Guarantor States and International Organizations, the Mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Collective Peacekeeping Forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States, in assisting the parties in the implementation of the General Agreement,
	Noting that, despite the conclusion of the peace process and significant progress in the security environment, the humanitarian situation has not improved, owing to the severe economic deterioration and the prevailing drought, and that significant humanitarian needs continue to exist throughout Tajikistan,
	Recognizing that until the economy is able to support the Tajik population, humanitarian operations will remain a critical factor in strengthening the achievements of the peace process in Tajikistan,
	Expressing regret that, despite the importance of humanitarian operations for contributing to peace and stability, donor response to both the 1999 and the 2000 consolidated inter-agency appeals has been insufficient,
	Stressing that international funding for humanitarian operations is particularly important since such operations remain the principal means by which hundreds of thousands of Tajiks meet their basic needs,
	Noting with concern the lack of support for food assistance and health programmes, which aim to save lives and must receive immediate funding if social catastrophe is to be avoided in Tajikistan,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General,3 and endorses the observations and recommendations set out therein;

	7.	Expresses its appreciation to the States, the United Nations, the World Bank and other intergovernmental organizations and all relevant humanitarian organizations, agencies and non-governmental organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, that have responded and continue to respond positively to the humanitarian needs of Tajikistan;
	8.	Encourages Member States and others concerned to continue assistance to alleviate the urgent humanitarian needs of Tajikistan and to offer support to Tajikistan for the post-conflict rehabilitation and reconstruction of its economy;
	9. 	Warmly welcomes the intention of the Secretary-General to continue the United Nations humanitarian programme in Tajikistan by issuing a consolidated inter-agency appeal for humanitarian assistance to Tajikistan for 2001, as a strategic document that will guide a gradual transition to a more development-oriented focus, and invites Member States to fund programmes included in the appeal; 
	10. 	Calls upon the Secretary-General to re-evaluate in 2001 all humanitarian assistance activities in Tajikistan with a view to addressing longer-term developmental issues;

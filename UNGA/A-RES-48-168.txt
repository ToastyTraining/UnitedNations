48/168.Economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against developing countries


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling the relevant principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations,

	Reaffirming that no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights,

	Reaffirming its resolutions 44/215 of 22 December 1989 and 46/210 of 20 December 1991,

	Gravely concerned that the use of coercive economic measures adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on the world-wide effort to move towards a non-discriminatory, open trading system,

	Having considered the note by the Secretary-General prepared pursuant   to  General Assembly resolution 46/210 and the ideas contained therein, 1/

	1/	A/48/535.


	Concerned that the mandate referred to in paragraph 4 of its resolution 46/210 has not been fully implemented,

	Taking into account the restructuring of the United Nations Secretariat and the consequent reallocation of functions,

	1.	Calls upon the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral economic coercive measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations, as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another;

	2.	Urges the implementation of its resolutions 44/215 and 46/210;

	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to assign to the Department of Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis of the Secretariat, in cooperation with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the function of continuing to monitor the imposition of measures of this nature, as well as to continue the preparation of studies in this field as mandated by the General Assembly in its resolutions 44/215 and 46/210;

	4.	Also requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session on the implementation of the present resolution.

Annex
Code of conduct for the judges of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the United Nations Appeals Tribunal
Preamble
	Whereas the Charter of the United Nations affirms, inter alia, the determination of Member States to establish conditions under which justice can be maintained to achieve international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms without any discrimination,
	Whereas the Universal Declaration of Human Rights recognizes as fundamental the principle that everyone is entitled in full equality to a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal, in the determination of rights and obligations,
	Whereas this right is endorsed and elaborated upon in a range of important international human rights instruments, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
	Whereas the General Assembly, in paragraph 4 of its resolution 61/261 of 4 April 2007, decided to establish an independent, transparent, professionalized, adequately resourced and decentralized system of administration of justice consistent with the relevant rules of international law and the principles of the rule of law and due process to ensure respect for the rights and obligations of staff members and the accountability of managers and staff members alike,
	Whereas the fair resolution of employment grievances will contribute to efficiency in the work carried out by the United Nations and enhance the integrity of the Organization,
	Whereas public confidence in the internal justice system and in the moral authority and integrity of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the United Nations Appeals Tribunal is of the utmost importance within the working environment of the United Nations,
	Whereas it is essential that judges, individually and collectively, respect and honour judicial office as a public trust, and strive to enhance and maintain confidence in the internal justice system,
	And whereas the Basic Principles on the Independence of the Judiciary are designed to secure and promote the independence of judicial bodies, and can provide guidance for the internal administration of justice,
	The following values and principles are adopted to establish standards for the conduct of the judges of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the United Nations Appeals Tribunal, to provide guidance to those judges and also to assist the staff and management of the United Nations to better understand and support the work of the United Nations Dispute Tribunal and the United Nations Appeals Tribunal within the United Nations: 

1.	Independence
	(a)	Judges must uphold the independence and integrity of the internal justice system of the United Nations and must act independently in the performance of their duties, free of any inappropriate influences, inducements, pressures or threats from any party or quarter;
	(b)	In order to protect the institutional independence of the Tribunals, judges must take all reasonable steps to ensure that no person, party, institution or State interferes, directly or indirectly, with the Tribunals;

2.	Impartiality
	(a)	Judges must act without fear, favour, or prejudice in all matters that they adjudicate;
	(b)	Judges must ensure that their conduct at all times maintains the confidence of all in the impartiality of the Tribunals;
	(c)	Judges must recuse themselves from a case if: 
(i)	They have a conflict of interest;
(ii)	It may reasonably appear to a properly informed person that they have a conflict of interest;
(iii)	They have personal knowledge of disputed evidentiary facts concerning the proceedings;
	(d)	Judges must not recuse themselves on insubstantial grounds. Judges must provide reasons when they decide an application for recusal;

	(f)	Judges must not participate in the determination of a case in which any member of their family is a litigant or represents a litigant, or in the outcome of which any member of their family has a significant interest;
	(g)	In order to determine whether they should recuse themselves from any matter, judges must be aware of their personal and fiduciary financial interests and shall, as far as reasonably possible, make efforts to be informed about the financial interests of members of their immediate family;
	(h)	(i)	Judges must not directly or indirectly negotiate or accept any remuneration, income, compensation, gift, advantage or privilege that is incompatible with judicial office or that can reasonably be perceived either as a reward or as likely to influence them in favour of a particular party;
	(ii)	Judges may receive a token gift, decoration, award or benefit that does not result in the incompatibility or reasonable perception referred to in subparagraph (h) (i) above;
	(i)	Judges must not engage in financial, political or business dealings or activities, including fund-raising activities, that are inconsistent with, and reflect adversely upon, the independence and impartiality required by their status as judges, that may reasonably be perceived to exploit the judge's judicial position, or that are in any other way incompatible with judicial office in the United Nations;

3.	Integrity
	(a)	Judges must be of high moral character and always, and not only in the discharge of their duties, act honourably and in accordance with the values and principles set out in the present Code;

	(i)	Judges may form or join associations of judges;
	(j)	Subject to the proper and effective performance of judicial duties, a judge may engage in any lawful activity as long as it does not bring the judicial office in the United Nations into disrepute in the mind of reasonable members of the community;

5.	Transparency
	Judges must observe the principle of open justice, namely that justice must be seen to be done, and take reasonable steps to ensure that this principle is honoured in the manner in which cases before the Tribunals are handled;

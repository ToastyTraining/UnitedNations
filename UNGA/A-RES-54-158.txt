54/158.	International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families

    The General Assembly,

    Reaffirming once more the permanent validity of the principles and norms set forth in the basic instruments regarding the international protection of human rights, in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 the International Covenants on Human Rights,2 the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,3 the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,4 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child,5

    Bearing in mind the principles and norms established within the framework of the International Labour Organization and the importance of the work done in connection with migrant workers and members of their families in other specialized agencies and in various organs of the United Nations,

    Reiterating that, despite the existence of an already established body of principles and norms, there is a need to make further efforts to improve the situation and to guarantee respect for the human rights and dignity of all migrant workers and members of their families,
    
    Aware of the situation of migrant workers and members of their families and the marked increase in migratory movements that has occurred, especially in certain parts of the world,

    Considering that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993,6 all States are urged to guarantee the protection of the human rights of all migrant workers and members of their families,

    Underlining the importance of the creation and promotion of conditions to foster greater harmony and tolerance between migrant workers and the rest of the society of the State in which they reside, with the aim of eliminating the growing manifestations of racism and xenophobia perpetrated in segments of many societies by individuals or groups against migrant workers,

    Recalling its resolution 45/158 of 18 December 1990, by which it adopted and opened for signature, ratification and accession the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families,

    Bearing in mind that, in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, States are invited to consider the possibility of signing and ratifying the Convention at the earliest possible time,

    Recalling that, in its resolution 53/137 of 9 December 1998, it requested the Secretary-General to submit to it at its fifty-fourth session a report on the status of the Convention,

    1.	Expresses its deep concern at the growing manifestations of racism, xenophobia and other forms of discrimination and inhuman or degrading treatment directed against migrant workers in different parts of the world;

    2.	Welcomes the signature or ratification of or accession to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families by some Member States;

    3.	Calls upon all Member States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Convention as a matter of priority, expresses the hope that it will enter into force at an early date, and notes that, pursuant to article 87 of the Convention, only eight ratifications or accessions are still needed for it to enter into force;

    4.	Requests the Secretary-General to provide all the facilities and assistance necessary for the promotion of the Convention through the World Public Information Campaign on Human Rights and the programme of advisory services in the field of human rights;

    5.	Welcomes the global campaign for the entry into force of the Convention, and invites the organizations and agencies of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to intensify further their efforts with a view to disseminating information on and promoting understanding of the importance of the Convention;


    6.	Welcomes the decision of the Commission on Human Rights, in its resolution 1999/44 of 27 April 1999,7 to appoint a Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants to examine ways and means to overcome the obstacles existing to the full and effective protection of the human rights of this vulnerable group;

    7.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General,8 and requests him to submit an updated report on the status of the Convention to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session;

    8.	Decides to consider the report of the Secretary-General at its fifty-fifth session under the sub-item entitled "Implementation of human rights instruments".

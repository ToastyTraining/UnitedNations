    Recalling its resolutions 52/100 of 12 December 1997, 52/231 of 4 June 1998 and 53/120 of 9 December 1998, in which it decided to convene a high-level plenary review as a special session of the General Assembly, which will take place from 5 to 9 June 2000, entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century",

    Recalling also its resolutions 52/93 and 52/97 of 12 December 1997, 53/116, 53/117 and 53/118 of 9 December 1998, and bearing in mind its resolution 54/4 of 6 October 1999,

    Stressing the importance of the special session and the need for strong, sustained political will and commitment at the national, regional and international levels towards achieving equality between women and men, and, in this regard, reaffirming that the full implementation of the Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women1 requires further action by all,


    Reaffirming its decision that the special session will be undertaken on the basis of and with full respect for the Platform for Action and that there will be no renegotiation of the existing agreements contained therein,

    Deeply convinced that the Beijing Declaration2 and the Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women are important contributions to the advancement of women worldwide in the achievement of gender equality and must be translated into effective action by all States, the United Nations system and other organizations concerned, as well as by non-governmental organizations,

    Recognizing that the responsibility for the implementation of the Platform for Action rests primarily at the national level and that strengthened efforts are necessary in this respect, and reiterating that enhanced international cooperation is essential for the effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action,

    1.	Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on the follow-up to the Fourth World Conference on Women and full implementation of the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action;3

    2.	Commends the work of the Commission on the Status of Women acting as the preparatory committee for the special session of the General Assembly entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century";

    3.	Takes note of the ministerial communiqué adopted by the Economic and Social Council at the high-level segment of its substantive session of 1999 on the theme "The role of employment and work in poverty eradication: the empowerment and advancement of women",4 as well as Council resolution 1999/55 of 30 July 1999 on integrated and coordinated implementation of and follow-up to major United Nations conferences and summits;

    4.	Welcomes the initiatives and actions taken by Governments, the United Nations system and other international organizations as well as by non-governmental organizations and other actors of civil society towards the accelerated implementation of the Beijing Declaration2 and the Platform for Action,1 and calls upon them to implement effectively all the critical areas of concern of the Platform for Action by promoting the empowerment of women at all levels and their full participation in all spheres of society through, inter alia, an active and visible policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective at all levels;

    5.	Also welcomes the replies from Governments to the questionnaire on the implementation of the Platform for Action,5 and once again invites Governments that have not yet done so to submit national evaluations of the implementation of the Platform for Action, in accordance with Economic and Social Council resolution 1999/50 of 29 July 1999;
    
    6.	Recognizes the importance attached to the regional and subregional monitoring of the global and regional platforms for action by regional commissions and other subregional or regional structures, within their mandates, in consultation with Governments, and calls for the promotion of cooperation in that respect among Governments and, where appropriate, national machineries of the same region;

    7.	Reaffirms that, in order to implement the Platform for Action, adequate mobilization of resources at the national and international levels, as well as new and additional resources for the developing countries, in particular those in Africa and the least developed countries, from all available funding mechanisms, including multilateral, bilateral and private sources, will also be required;

    8.	Recognizes that implementation of the Platform for Action in the countries with economies in transition requires continued national efforts and international cooperation and assistance, as indicated in the Platform for Action;

    9.	Reaffirms that, in order to implement the Platform for Action, a reformulation of policies and reallocation of resources may be needed, but that some policy changes may not necessarily have financial implications;

    10.	Calls upon Member States to allocate adequate resources for the provision of data disaggregated by sex and age for undertaking gender impact analysis and measuring progress in order to develop successful national implementation strategies for the Platform for Action;

    11.	Encourages all entities of the United Nations system, including the programmes, funds and specialized agencies, and the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, to continue their active involvement in the preparations for the special session and to participate at the highest level in the special session, including through presentations on best practices, obstacles encountered and a vision for the future to accelerate implementation of the Platform for Action and address new and emerging trends;

    12.	Welcomes the initiatives and activities of all regional commissions and other intergovernmental organizations in support of the preparations for the special session;

    13.	Reiterates that participation in the special session should be at a high political level;

    14.	Invites Member States to include representatives of national machineries for the advancement of women in their delegations to the preparatory committee and the special session;

    15.	Reiterates the decision that non-governmental organizations in consultative status with the Economic and Social Council, as well as the non-governmental organizations that were accredited to the Fourth World Conference on Women, may participate in the special session without creating a precedent for future sessions of the General Assembly;6

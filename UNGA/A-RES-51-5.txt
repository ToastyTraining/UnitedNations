	Reaffirming the utility of the Panama Canal for international maritime transport and the growth of the world economy, and the need to tackle the problems of interoceanic communication in the twenty-first century,

	Noting with appreciation the activities being undertaken in various spheres by Governments, organizations and programmes of the United Nations system and other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in support of the holding of the Universal Congress,

	1.	Notes with satisfaction the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of resolution 50/12; 1/

	2.	Reiterates its firm support for the initiative of the Government of Panama, and urges it to continue to intensify its efforts to organize the Universal Congress on the Panama Canal at Panama City from 7 to 10 September 1997;

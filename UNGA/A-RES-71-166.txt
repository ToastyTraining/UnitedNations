	Convinced that literacy is crucial to the acquisition by every child, young person and adult of the essential life skills that will enable them to address the challenges that they may face in life and represents an essential condition of lifelong learning, which is an indispensable means for effective participation in the knowledge societies and economies of the twenty-first century,
	Reaffirming the right of indigenous peoples to have non-discriminatory access to all levels and forms of education provided by States, and recognizing the importance of effective measures to promote access for indigenous individuals, in particular children, to education in their own language, whenever possible, as addressed in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,3

	3.	Calls upon Governments to scale up literacy programmes for children, youth and adults, with particular attention to those who are vulnerable or marginalized, to foster innovative delivery of literacy services, including through technology and a strengthened institutional network, to promote an intersectoral approach by linking literacy learning with multiple sectors to address diverse learning needs, such as through relevant and inclusive educational resources in different languages, to establish multi-stakeholder partnerships with the active participation of civil society and the private sector, to improve distance and digital learning resources and to develop a data-collection mechanism to assess levels of literacy;

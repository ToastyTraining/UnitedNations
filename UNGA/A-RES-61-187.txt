Notes the proposal to use special drawing rights allocations for development purposes, and considers that any assessment of special drawing rights allocations must respect the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund and the established rules of procedure of the Fund, which requires taking into account the global need for liquidity at the international level;

Calls for the continued effort of the multilateral financial institutions, in providing policy advice, technical assistance and financial support to member countries, to work on the basis of nationally owned reform and development strategies, to pay due regard to the special needs and implementing capacities of developing countries and countries with economies in transition and to minimize the negative impacts of the adjustment programmes on the vulnerable segments of society, while taking into account the importance of gender-sensitive employment and hunger and poverty eradication policies and strategies;

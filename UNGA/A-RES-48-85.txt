		48/85.Consolidation of the regime established by the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco)


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling that in its resolution 1911 (XVIII) of 27 November 1963 it expressed the hope that the States of Latin America would take appropriate measures to conclude a treaty that would prohibit nuclear weapons in Latin America,

	Recalling also that in the same resolution it voiced its confidence that, once such a treaty was concluded, all States, and particularly the nuclear-weapon States, would lend it their full cooperation for the effective realization of its peaceful aims,

	Considering that in its resolution 2028 (XX) of 19 November 1965 it established the principle of an acceptable balance of mutual responsibilities and obligations between nuclear-weapon States and those which do not possess such weapons,

	Recalling that the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco) 1/ was opened for signature at Mexico City on 14 February 1967,




                    

  1/	 United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 634, No. 9068.

	Recalling also that in its preamble the Treaty of Tlatelolco states that military denuclearized zones are not an end in themselves but rather a means for achieving general and complete disarmament at a later stage,

	Recalling further that in its resolution 2286 (XXII) of 5 December 1967 it welcomed with special satisfaction the Treaty of Tlatelolco as an event of historic significance in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to promote international peace and security,

	Bearing in mind that the Treaty of Tlatelolco is open for signature to all the sovereign States of Latin America and the Caribbean and that it contains two additional protocols that are open for signature, respectively, to the States that de jure or de facto are internationally responsible for territories located within the zone of application of the Treaty and to the nuclear-weapon States,

	Bearing in mind also that, with the adherence in 1993 of Dominica, the Treaty of Tlatelolco is in force for twenty-five sovereign States of the region,

	Recalling that since 1992 Additional Protocol I has been in force for all the States that de jure or de facto are internationally responsible for territories located within the zone of application of the Treaty,

	Recalling also that since 1974 Additional Protocol II has been in force for the five nuclear-weapon States,

	Mindful that international conditions are more propitious for the consolidation of the regime established by the Treaty of Tlatelolco,

	Recalling that in 1992 the General Conference of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean approved and opened for signature a set of amendments to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, submitted jointly by Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico, 2/  with the aim of enabling the full entry into force of that instrument,

	Noting with satisfaction the holding of the thirteenth regular session of the General Conference at Mexico City on 27 and 28 May 1993,

	Noting that the Government of Cuba has declared that, in pursuit of regional unity, it would be ready to sign the Treaty of Tlatelolco once all the States of the region have assumed the undertakings of that Treaty,

	Taking into account the declaration presented by the delegation of Brazil at the aforementioned session of the General Conference in which it was stated that the full entry into force of the Treaty of Tlatelolco  for Argentina, Brazil and Chile was imminent,

	Noting with satisfaction that on 1 September 1993 the Government of Mexico made that country the first State to deposit its instrument of ratification of the amendments to articles 14, 15, 16, 19 and 20 of the Treaty 
                

      2/    A/47/467, annex.
of Tlatelolco approved by the General Conference on 26 August 1992 in its resolution 290 (VII), 2/

[on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/71/507)] 
71/137.	2016 Notes on Organizing Arbitral Proceedings of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17December 1966, by which it established the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law with a mandate to further the progressive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade and in that respect to bear in mind the interests of all peoples, in particular those of developing countries, in the extensive development of international trade,
	Recalling also its resolution 51/161 of 16 December 1996, in which it commended the Commission for the finalization of the Notes on Organizing Arbitral Proceedings,
	Reaffirming the value and increased use of arbitration as a method of settling disputes, 
	Recognizing the need for revising the Notes to conform to current arbitral practices,
	Noting that the purpose of the Notes is to list and briefly describe matters relevant to the organization of arbitral proceedings and that the Notes, prepared with a focus on international arbitration, are intended to be used in a general and universal manner, regardless of whether the arbitration is administered by an arbitral institution, 
	Noting also that the Notes do not seek to promote any practice as best practice, given that procedural styles and practices in arbitration vary and each of them has its own merit, 
	Recognizing that the revision of the Notes was the subject of due deliberation in the Commission, which benefited greatly from consultations with Governments and interested intergovernmental and international non-governmental organizations active in the field of arbitration, including arbitral institutions, as well as individual experts,
	1.	Expresses its appreciation to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law for preparing and adopting the 2016 Notes on Organizing Arbitral Proceedings;1 
	2.	Recommends the use of the 2016 Notes, including by parties to arbitration, arbitral tribunals and arbitral institutions, as well as for academic and training purposes with respect to international commercial dispute settlement;
	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to publish the 2016 Notes, including electronically, in the six official languages of the United Nations, and to make all efforts to ensure that the Notes become generally known and available.

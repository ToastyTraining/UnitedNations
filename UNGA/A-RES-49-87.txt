	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the item entitled "The situation in the Middle East",

	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General of 20 October 1994, 1/

	Recalling Security Council resolution 497 (1981) of 17 December 1981,

	Reaffirming the fundamental principle of the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force,

	Reaffirming once more the applicability of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, 2/ to the occupied Syrian Golan,

	Deeply concerned that Israel has not withdrawn from the Syrian Golan, which has been under occupation since 1967, contrary to the relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions,

	Noting with satisfaction the convening at Madrid of the Peace Conference on the Middle East on the basis of Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) of 22 November 1967 and 338 (1973) of 22 October 1973, with the hope that substantial and concrete progress will be achieved on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks for the realization of a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region,

__________

	2/	United Nations, Treaty Series, vol. 75, No. 973.


	2.	Declares also that the Knesset decision of 11 November 1991 annexing the occupied Syrian Golan constitutes a grave violation of Security Council resolution 497 (1981) and therefore is null and void and has no validity whatsoever, and calls upon Israel to rescind it;

	3.	Reaffirms its determination that all relevant provisions of the Regulations annexed to the Hague Convention of 1907, 3/ and the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War, of 12 August 1949, continue to apply to the Syrian territory occupied by Israel since 1967, and calls upon the parties thereto to respect and ensure respect for their obligations under those instruments in all circumstances;

	4.	Determines once more that the continued occupation of the Syrian Golan and its de facto annexation constitute a stumbling-block in the way of achieving a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the region;

	5.	Demands once more that Israel withdraw from all the occupied Syrian Golan in implementation of the relevant Security Council resolutions;

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session on the implementation of the present resolution.

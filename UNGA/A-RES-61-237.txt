Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 22 December 2006
[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/61/512/Add.1)]
61/237.	Scale of assessments for the apportionment 
of the expenses of the United Nations


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its previous resolutions and decisions on the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations, including its resolutions 43/223 B of 21 December 1988, 46/221 B of 20 December 1991, 55/5 B, C and D of 23 December 2000, 57/4 B of 20 December 2002 and 58/1 B of 23 December 2003, 
	Recalling in particular its resolution 55/5 B, in which it decided to fix the elements of the scale of assessments for two successive scale periods until 2006, subject to the provisions of its resolution 55/5 C, 
	Recalling paragraphs 5 and 6 of its resolution 58/1 B, 
	Noting that the application of the current methodology has led to substantial increases in the rate of assessment of some Member States, including developing countries, 
	Having considered the report of the Committee on Contributions,1
	1.	Affirms that the determination of the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations shall remain the prerogative of the General Assembly; 
	2.	Reaffirms the obligation of all Member States to bear the expenses of the United Nations, as apportioned by the General Assembly, in conformity with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations; 
	3.	Also reaffirms the fundamental principle that the expenses of the Organization shall be apportioned broadly according to capacity to pay; 
	4.	Further reaffirms that the Committee on Contributions as a technical body is required to prepare the scale of assessments strictly on the basis of reliable, verifiable and comparable data; 
	5.	Decides that the scale of assessments for the period 2007-2009 shall be based on the following elements and criteria: 
	(a)	Estimates of gross national income;
	(b)	Average statistical base periods of three and six years;
	(c)	Conversion rates based on market exchange rates, except where that would cause excessive fluctuations and distortions in the income of some Member States, when price-adjusted rates of exchange or other appropriate conversion rates should be employed, taking due account of its resolution 46/221 B;
	(d)	The debt-burden approach employed in the scale of assessments for the period 2004-2006;
	(e)	A low per capita income adjustment of 80 per cent, with a threshold per capita income limit of the average per capita gross national income of all Member States for the statistical base periods;
	(f)	A minimum assessment rate of 0.001 per cent;
	(g)	A maximum assessment rate for the least developed countries of 0.01 per cent;
	(h)	A maximum assessment rate of 22 per cent;
	6.	Resolves that the scale of assessments for the contributions of Member States to the regular budget of the United Nations for 2007, 2008 and 2009 shall be as follows:

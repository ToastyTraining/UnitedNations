	6.	Underlines the importance of promoting international financial stability and sustainable growth, and welcomes the efforts undertaken to this end by the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Forum, as well as the consideration by the International Monetary and Financial Committee of ways to sharpen tools designed to promote international financial stability and enhance crisis prevention, inter alia, through an even-handed implementation of surveillance, including at the regional level, and a sharpening of surveillance of capital markets and systemically and regionally important countries, with a view, inter alia, to the early identification of problems and risks, integrating debt sustainability analysis, the fostering of appropriate policy responses, the possible provision of financing and other instruments designed to prevent the emergence or spread of financial crises and further improvements in the transparency of macroeconomic data and statistical information on international capital flows;

	8.	Invites developed countries, in particular major industrialized economies, to take into account the effect of their macroeconomic policies on international growth and development;

Underscores the importance of competitive and inclusive private and public financial markets in mobilizing and allocating savings towards productive investment and thus making a vital contribution to national development efforts and to an international financial architecture that is supportive of development; 
	13.	Invites the international financial and banking institutions to consider enhancing the transparency of risk-rating mechanisms, noting that sovereign risk assessments made by the private sector should maximize the use of strict, objective and transparent parameters, which can be facilitated by high-quality data and analysis, and encourages relevant development institutions, including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to continue their work on this issue, including its potential impact on the development prospects of developing countries;

	17.	Notes the proposal to use special drawing rights allocations for development purposes, and considers that any assessment of special drawing rights allocations must respect the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund and the established rules of procedure of the Fund, which requires taking into account the global need for liquidity at the international level; 
	18.	Invites the multilateral and regional development banks and development funds to continue to play a vital role in serving the development needs of developing countries and countries with economies in transition, including through coordinated action, as appropriate, and stresses that strengthened regional development banks and subregional financial institutions add flexible financial support to national and regional development efforts, thus enhancing their ownership and overall efficiency, and are an essential source of knowledge and expertise for their developing-country members;

Calls for the continued effort of the multilateral financial institutions, in providing policy advice, technical assistance and financial support to member countries, to work on the basis of nationally owned reform and development strategies, to pay due regard to the special needs and implementing capacities of developing countries and countries with economies in transition and to minimize the negative impacts of the adjustment programmes on the vulnerable segments of society, while taking into account the importance of gender-sensitive employment and hunger and poverty eradication policies and strategies;

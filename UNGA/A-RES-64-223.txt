	Taking note of the continuing increase in the number of public-private partnerships worldwide, 
	Recalling the objectives formulated in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 notably the Millennium Development Goals, and the reaffirmation they received in the 2005 World Summit Outcome,2 particularly in regard to developing partnerships through the provision of greater opportunities to the private sector, non-governmental organizations and civil society in general so as to enable them to contribute to the realization of the goals and programmes of the Organization, in particular in the pursuit of development and the eradication of poverty, 
	Recalling also the 2005 World Summit encouragement to pursue responsible business practices,
	Underlining the fact that cooperation between the United Nations and all relevant partners, including the private sector, shall serve the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, can make concrete contributions to the realization of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, as well as the outcomes of major United Nations conferences and summits and their reviews, in particular in the area of development and the eradication of poverty, and shall be undertaken in a manner that maintains the integrity, impartiality and independence of the Organization, 
	Underlining also the importance of the contribution of the private sector, non-governmental organizations and civil society to the implementation of the outcomes of United Nations conferences in the economic, social and related fields, 
	Reiterating that maintaining a comprehensive and diverse multi-stakeholder follow-up process to the 2002 International Conference on Financing for Development and the 2008 Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development, including with civil society and the private sector, is critical, bearing in mind the core responsibility of all participants in the financing for development process to exercise ownership of it and to implement their respective commitments in an integrated fashion, and welcoming in this regard the active participation of civil society and private-sector entities,

	Welcoming the efforts and encouraging further efforts by all relevant partners, including the private sector, to engage as reliable and consistent partners in the development process and to take into account not only the economic and financial, but also the developmental, social, human rights, gender and environmental implications of their undertakings and, in general, towards accepting and implementing corporate social and environmental responsibility, that is, bringing such values and responsibilities to bear on their conduct and policy premised on profit incentives, in conformity with national laws and regulations, 
	Underlining the fact that, in the face of the current multiple, interrelated global crises and challenges, such as the financial and economic crisis, the food crisis, volatile energy and commodity prices, and climate change, cooperation and increased commitment by all relevant partners, including the public sector, the private sector and civil society, are needed more than ever, and recognizing, in this context, the potential that partnerships have in contributing to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals,

	Recognizing the importance of promoting a gender perspective in global partnerships, 
	Taking note of the Principles for Responsible Investment initiative, created to help investors to integrate environmental, social and corporate governance issues into investment decisions, and the Principles for Responsible Management Education initiative, which seeks to embed corporate responsibility principles in business school curricula and research, 
	Welcoming the continuous efforts by the Commission on Sustainable Development, through its secretariat, to promote partnerships for sustainable development, inter alia, by the implementation and expansion of an interactive online database as a platform to provide access to information on partnerships and to facilitate the exchange of experiences and best practices and by the regular holding of partnership fairs at the sessions of the Commission,

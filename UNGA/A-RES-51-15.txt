	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

51/15.Financing of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

	Recalling Security Council resolution 1063 (1996) of 28 June 1996, by which the Council established the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti until 30 November 1996,

	Recognizing that the costs of the Support Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recognizing also that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Support Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,


	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Support Mission by certain Governments,

	Noting also that the assessed contributions to the special account to be established for the Support Mission will cover only direct and indirect costs associated with the six hundred contingent personnel and three hundred civilian police authorized by the Security Council in its resolution            1063 (1996),

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Support Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	2.	Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti in full and on time;

	3.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;2

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Support Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

	5.	Also requests the Secretary-General to establish a special account for the Support Mission in accordance with paragraph 13 of his report;1

	6.	Decides to appropriate the amount of 28,704,200 United States dollars gross (27,506,000 dollars net) for the maintenance of the Support Mission for the period from 1 July to 31 December 1996, inclusive of the amount of 13,447,000 dollars gross and net remaining from the appropriation provided under General Assembly resolution 50/90 B of 7 June 1996 for the liquidation of the United Nations Mission in Haiti, with which the Advisory Committee has concurred, for the period from 1 July to 15 September 1996 and the amount of 5,762,800 dollars gross (5,420,700 dollars net) authorized by the Advisory Committee under the terms of section IV of Assembly                resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994 for the period from 16 September to     15 October 1996;

	7.

	8.

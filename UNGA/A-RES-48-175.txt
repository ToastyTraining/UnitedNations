	Taking note of the recommendation contained in paragraph 38.27 of Agenda 21 3/ and of decision 93/33 of 18 June 1993 of the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme, 4/ in which the Governing Council encouraged the Administrator to strengthen the substantive role and maintain the identity of the United Nations Sudano-Sahelian Office as the focal point within the Programme for all matters related to drought and desertification control, in particular those in Africa, in accordance with the ongoing process of integrating the Office into the core programme of the Programme,

	Recalling the appeals to the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Environment Programme to continue and strengthen their cooperation in combating desertification, notably through support for the United Nations Sudano-Sahelian Office by the joint venture programme,

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 18 December 2007
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/62/433 (Part II))]
62/132.	Violence against women migrant workers


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling all of its previous resolutions on violence against women migrant workers and those adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women, the Commission on Human Rights and the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, and the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women,1
	Reaffirming the provisions concerning women migrant workers contained in the outcome documents of the World Conference on Human Rights,2 the International Conference on Population and Development,3 the Fourth World Conference on Women4 and the World Summit for Social Development5 and their five-year reviews,
	Noting with appreciation the various activities initiated by entities of the United Nations system, such as the Regional Programme on Empowering Women Migrant Workers in Asia of the United Nations Development Fund for Women, the high-level panel discussion on the gender dimensions of international migration held by the Commission on the Status of Women at its fiftieth session, and the discussions held by the Commission at its fifty-first session, during which it took note, inter alia, of the particular situation of girl migrants, and noting the contribution of the International Labour Organization through the development of a Multilateral Framework on Labour Migration, as well as other activities through which the plight of women migrant workers continues to be assessed and alleviated,
	Recalling the discussions during the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, held on 14 and 15 September 2006, which recognized, inter alia, the need for special protection for migrant women,
	Recognizing the increasing participation of women in international migration, driven in large part by socio-economic factors, and that this feminization of migration requires greater gender sensitivity in all policies and efforts related to the subject of international migration,
	Stressing the shared responsibility of all stakeholders, in particular countries of origin, transit and destination, relevant regional and international organizations, the private sector and civil society, in promoting an environment that prevents and addresses violence against women migrant workers,
	Acknowledging the contribution that women migrant workers make to development through the economic benefits that accrue to both the country of origin and the country of destination,
	Recognizing the particular vulnerability of women and their children at all stages of the migration process, extending from the moment of deciding to migrate, and including transit, engagement in formal and informal employment, and integration into the host society, as well as during their return to their countries of origin,
	Expressing deep concern at the continuing reports of grave abuses and violence committed against migrant women and girls, including gender-based violence, in particular sexual violence, trafficking, domestic and family violence, racist and xenophobic acts, abusive labour practices and exploitative conditions of work,
	Recognizing that the intersection of, inter alia, gender, age, class and ethnic discrimination and stereotypes can compound the discrimination faced by women migrant workers,
	Reaffirming the commitment to protect and promote the human rights of all women, including, without discrimination, indigenous women who migrate for work, and in this regard noting the attention paid in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples6 to the elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination against indigenous women, as appropriate,
	Noting with concern that many migrant women who are employed in the informal economy and in less skilled work are especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, and underlining in this regard the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants so as to prevent abuse and exploitation,
	Emphasizing the need for objective, comprehensive and broad-based information, including sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics, and gender-sensitive indicators for research and analysis, and a wide exchange of experience and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers,
	Realizing that the movement of a significant number of women migrant workers may be facilitated and made possible by means of fraudulent or irregular documentation and sham marriages with the object of migration, that this may be facilitated through, among other things, the Internet, and that those women migrant workers are more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation,
	Recognizing the importance of joint and collaborative approaches and strategies at the bilateral, regional, interregional and international levels in protecting and promoting the human rights and welfare of women migrant workers,
	Recognizing also the importance of exploring the link between migration and trafficking in order to further efforts towards protecting women migrant workers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse,
	Encouraged by some measures adopted by some countries of destination to alleviate the plight of women migrant workers residing in their areas of jurisdiction, such as the establishment of protection mechanisms for migrant workers, facilitating their access to mechanisms for reporting complaints, or providing assistance during legal proceedings,
	Underlining the important role of relevant United Nations treaty bodies in monitoring the implementation of human rights conventions and the relevant special procedures, within their respective mandates, in addressing the problem of violence against women migrant workers and in protecting and promoting their human rights and welfare,
	1.	Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General;7

	10.	Further urges Governments, in cooperation with international organizations, civil society, including non-governmental organizations, and the private sector, to strengthen the focus on and funding support for the prevention of violence against women migrant workers, in particular by promoting the access of women to meaningful and gender-sensitive information and education on, inter alia, the costs and benefits of migration, rights and benefits to which they are entitled in the countries of origin and employment, overall conditions in countries of employment and procedures for legal migration, as well as to ensure that laws and policies governing recruiters, employers and intermediaries promote adherence to and respect for the human rights of migrant workers, particularly women;
	11.	Calls upon Governments, in cooperation with international organizations, non-governmental organizations, the private sector and other stakeholders, to provide women migrant workers who are victims of violence with the full range of immediate assistance and protection, such as access to counselling, legal and consular assistance and temporary shelter, as well as mechanisms to allow the views and concerns of victims to be presented and considered at appropriate stages of proceedings, including other measures that will allow victims to be present during the judicial process, to the extent possible, as well as to establish reintegration and rehabilitation schemes for returning women migrant workers;

Also calls upon Governments, in particular those of the countries of origin and destination, to put in place penal and criminal sanctions to punish perpetrators and intermediaries of violence against women migrant workers, and redress and justice mechanisms that victims can access effectively, as well as to ensure that migrant women victims of violence do not suffer from re-victimization, including by authorities;

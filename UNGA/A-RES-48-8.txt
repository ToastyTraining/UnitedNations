	4.	Requests the Secretary-General, in cooperation with the relevant organs and organizations of the United Nations system and in close cooperation with the Nicaraguan authorities, to provide all necessary assistance to activities for the rehabilitation, reconstruction, stabilization and development of that country and to continue to ensure the timely, comprehensive, flexible and effective formulation and coordination of programmes of the United Nations system in Nicaragua, given the importance of those activities for the consolidation of peace;

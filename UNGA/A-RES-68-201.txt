	11.

	12. 	Reaffirms the importance of broadening and strengthening the participation of developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting, notes in this regard the important steps taken in the reform of the governance structures, quotas and voting rights of the Bretton Woods institutions, which go in the direction of better reflecting current realities and enhancing the voice, the participation and the voting rights of developing countries, and recognizes the importance of continuing such reform processes in an ambitious and expeditious manner in order to deliver more effective, credible, accountable and legitimate institutions;

	18. 	Recognizes the role of special drawing rights as an international reserve asset, acknowledges that special drawing rights allocations helped to supplement international reserves in response to the world financial and economic crisis, thus contributing to the stability of the international financial system and global economic resilience, and also recognizes the need to continue regular reviews of the role of special drawing rights, including with reference to their potential role in the international reserve system; 
	19.

	20. 	Stresses, in this regard, the need to strengthen intergovernmental and independent surveillance of national financial policies and their impact on international interest rates, exchange rates and capital flows; 
	21. 	Invites the international financial and banking institutions to continue to enhance the transparency of risk-rating mechanisms, noting that sovereign risk assessments made by the private sector should maximize the use of strict, objective and transparent parameters, which can be facilitated by high-quality data and analysis, and encourages relevant institutions, including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to continue their work on the issue, including its potential impact on the development prospects of developing countries;

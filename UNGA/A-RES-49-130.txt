	The General Assembly,

	Mindful of the need to avoid unnecessary duplication of work among United Nations bodies,

	Bearing in mind Economic and Social Council resolution 1913 (LVII) of 5 December 1974, in particular paragraphs 3 and 4 thereof, the document entitled "A New Partnership for Development:  The Cartagena Commitment", 1/ adopted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development at its eighth session, held at Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, from 8 to 25 February 1992, and General Assembly resolution 47/183 of 22 December 1992, in which the Assembly reaffirmed the important role of the Conference, inter alia, as the most appropriate focal point within the United Nations for the integrated treatment of development and interrelated issues in key areas, including trade, commodities, finance, investment, services and technology, in the interests of all countries, particularly those of developing countries,

	1.	Decides that the Commission on Transnational Corporations should become a commission of the Trade and Development Board and be renamed the Commission on International Investment and Transnational Corporations;

	2.	Requests the Trade and Development Board to address urgently the question of orienting the programme of work of the Commission on International Investment and Transnational Corporations on the basis of recommendations made by the Commission on Transnational Corporations at its twentieth session 2/ that the Board should orient the work in such a way as to attract the attendance of relevant senior public sector officials, whenever possible, as well as private sector representatives, and that the work should include:

	(c)	Reviewing, and providing guidance to the Secretariat on, technical assistance to Governments interested in developing investment regimes and enabling environments so as to attract more foreign investment and support for enterprise developments, thereby contributing to economic growth and development of host countries;

	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to restore in full the resources of the programme on transnational corporations as originally allocated in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1994-1995 and in accordance with General Assembly resolution 48/228 A of 23 December 1993;

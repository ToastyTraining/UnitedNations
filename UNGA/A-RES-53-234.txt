	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/53/986)]


53/234.	Financing of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium and the Civilian Police Support Group


    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium and the Civilian Police Support Group1 and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

    Recalling Security Council resolution 1037 (1996) of 15 January 1996, by which the Council established the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium for an initial period of twelve months, and resolution 1145 (1997) of 19 December 1997, in which the Council noted the termination of the Transitional Administration on 15 January 1998 and established, with effect from 16 January 1998, the Civilian Police Support Group for a single period of up to nine months,

    Recalling also its decision 50/481 of 11 April 1996 on the financing of the Transitional Administration and its subsequent resolutions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 52/244 of 26 June 1998,
    

    Reaffirming that the costs of the Transitional Administration and the Support Group are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

    Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Transitional Administration and the Support Group, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Transitional Administration,

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to continue to provide the account of the mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to meet its outstanding liabilities,

    1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium and the Civilian Police Support Group as at 30 April 1999, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 36.3 million United States dollars, representing 7 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Transitional Administration to the period ending 30 November 1998, notes that some 41 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

    2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

    3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

    4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the mission in full and on time;

    5.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;3
    
    6.	Decides that, on an exceptional basis, the special arrangements approved by General Assembly resolution 51/153 B of 13 June 1997 for the Transitional Administration with regard to the application of article IV of the financial regulations of the United Nations, whereby appropriations required in respect of obligations owed to Governments providing contingents and/or logistic support to the Transitional Administration shall be retained beyond the period stipulated under financial regulations 4.3 and 4.4, as set out in the annex to the present resolution, shall be applied to the Support Group;

    7.	Decides also to authorize the Secretary-General to utilize an amount of 601,200 dollars gross (541,500 dollars net) from the resources provided for the period ending 30 June 1998 in order to meet the cost of completing the liquidation of the mission as well as the final audit, inclusive of the amount of 553,400 dollars gross (493,700 dollars net) related to liquidation activities with which the Advisory Committee has already concurred;

    8.	Decides further that Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Transitional Administration and the Support Group shall be credited their respective share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 14,646,100 dollars gross (13,906,700 dollars net) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998;

    9.	Decides that, for Member States that have not fulfilled their obligations to the Transitional Administration and the Support Group, their share of the remaining unencumbered balance of 14,646,100 dollars gross (13,906,700 dollars net) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations;

    10.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the final disposition of the assets of the Transitional Administration and the Support Group;4

    11.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-fourth session the item entitled "Financing of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium and the Civilian Police Support Group".

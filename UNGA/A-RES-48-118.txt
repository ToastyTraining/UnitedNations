	Recognizing that more than half of the refugees and externally displaced persons in Djibouti are located in Djibouti City in most serious difficulties and without direct international assistance, exerting  intolerable pressure on the limited resources of the country and the social infrastructure and causing, in particular, serious problems of security,

	Also recognizing the need for cooperation between the Government of Djibouti and the High Commissioner and relevant organizations to find alternative solutions for the problem of refugees in Djibouti City and to be able to mobilize the necessary external assistance to meet their specific needs,

	Aware that the refugee population in the refugee camps throughout Djibouti is in a precarious situation, facing the threat of famine, malnutrition and disease, and that it needs adequate external assistance for the provision of foodstuff, medical assistance and the necessary infrastructure for shelter,

	Aware also that Eritrea has been devastated by a thirty-year war, which ended in May 1991, and repeated droughts over the years, that its economy and resources have been destroyed and that it is starting anew,

	Recognizing also the need for cooperation between the Government of Eritrea and the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat and relevant organizations to enable the mobilization of the necessary international assistance to put the programmes of human resettlement into action in Eritrea,

	Deeply concerned also about the grave consequences this has entailed for Ethiopia's capability to grapple with the effects of the prolonged drought and rebuild the country's economy,

	Aware of the heavy burden placed on the Government of Ethiopia and of the need for immediate and adequate assistance to refugees, voluntary returnees, displaced persons, demobilized soldiers and victims of natural disasters,

	Deeply concerned about the burden that has been placed on the Government and people of Kenya because of the influx of refugees fleeing the strife and famine that have stricken neighbouring countries and the infiltration of armed bandits and highly dangerous and illegal weapons from the situation obtaining in Somalia,

	Recognizing the great contribution and sacrifices that the Government of Kenya has made and continues to make in dealing with this situation, while facing deteriorating conditions caused by the impact of the persistent drought that has affected and continues to affect its own population,

	Emphasizing the importance and necessity of continuing assistance to the over four hundred thousand estimated refugees and displaced persons in Kenya until such time as this situation has changed,

	Deeply concerned about the tragic impact that the civil war in Somalia continues to have on the lives of its people, affecting four to five million people who are either refugees in neighbouring countries or internally displaced and are in need of urgent humanitarian assistance,

	Aware that the voluntary repatriation of large numbers of Somali refugees in neighbouring countries and elsewhere, as well as the return of internally displaced persons to their original homes, will still require a planned and integrated international assistance programme designed to cover their basic needs, ensure adequate reception arrangements and facilitate their smooth integration into their respective communities,

	Convinced that it is necessary that humanitarian assistance to Somali refugees, returnees and displaced persons be mobilized urgently and delivered without delay in view of the deteriorating situation of the displaced persons and returnees and the mounting pressure the refugees continue to place on the host countries,

	Recognizing that the Sudan has been hosting large numbers of refugees over an extended period of time,

	Aware of the economic difficulties facing the Government of the Sudan and the need for adequate assistance for the refugees and displaced persons in the Sudan and the rehabilitation of the areas in which they are located,

	Encouraging the Government of the Sudan and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees for the efforts they have undertaken for the voluntary repatriation of the large numbers of refugees to their homelands,

	Deeply concerned about the plight of Sudanese refugee children, particularly the problem of unaccompanied minors, and emphasizing the need for their protection, well-being and reunification with their families,

	Considering that the repatriation and reintegration of returnees and the relocation of displaced persons are aggravated by natural disasters and that the process poses serious humanitarian, social and economic problems for the Government of Chad,

	Noting with appreciation the continuing efforts of the Economic Community of West African States and the Organization of African Unity to restore peace, security and stability in Liberia, and the signing at Cotonou, Benin, on 25 July 1993, of the Peace Agreement between the Interim Government of National Unity of Liberia, the National Patriotic Front of Liberia and the United Liberation Movement of Liberia for Democracy, 5/ as well as the establishment of the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia, aimed at bringing an end to the conflict,

	Deeply concerned about the influx of internally displaced persons, returnees and refugees to Monrovia and the enormous burden this has placed on the infrastructure and fragile economy of the country,

	Also deeply concerned that, despite the efforts made to provide the necessary material and financial assistance for the refugees, returnees and displaced persons, the situation remains unsettled and has serious implications for the long-term national development of Liberia, as well as for those West African countries hosting Liberian refugees,

	Bearing in mind the continuing need to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to Liberian refugees, returnees and displaced persons, since the security situation is not yet propitious for the conduct of large-scale voluntary repatriation and reintegration,

	Recognizing the heavy burden placed on the people and Government of Malawi and the sacrifices they are making in caring for refugees, given the country's limited social services and infrastructure, and the need for adequate international assistance to Malawi to enable it to continue its efforts to provide assistance to the refugees,

	Gravely concerned about the continuing serious social, economic and environmental impact of the massive presence of refugees in Malawi, as well as its far-reaching consequences for the long-term development process and environmental effects,

concerted assistance to southern African countries sheltering refugees, returnees and displaced persons,

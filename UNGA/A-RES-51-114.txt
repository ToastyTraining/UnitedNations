51/114.Situation of human rights in Rwanda


	The General Assembly,

	Guided by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 the International Covenants on Human Rights,2 the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide3 and other applicable standards of human rights and humanitarian law,

	Recalling its resolutions 50/57 of 12 December 1995 and 50/200 of 22 December 1995, and taking note of Security Council resolutions 1050 (1996) of 8 March 1996, 1078 (1996) of 9 November 1996 and 1080 (1996) of 15 November 1996, and of Commission on Human Rights resolution 1996/76 of 23 April 1996,4 

	Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights and of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda that genocide and systematic and widespread violations of international humanitarian law, including crimes against humanity and grave violations and abuses of human rights, were committed in Rwanda,


	Recognizing that effective action must be taken to ensure that the perpetrators of genocide and crimes against humanity are promptly brought to justice, and noting in this regard that legislation to govern the prosecution of those accused of genocide or crimes against humanity entered into force on 1 September 1996,

	Noting with concern the implications of the current humanitarian crisis in the region,

	Welcoming the fact that considerable numbers of refugees have recently returned to Rwanda, and affirming the readiness of the international community to assist the Government of Rwanda in reintegrating these returnees,

	Recognizing that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strengthened human rights component is indispensable to the peace process and post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda,

	Welcoming contributions made by Member States and the European Union to the costs of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda,

	Welcoming also the commitment of the Government of Rwanda to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, to eliminate impunity and to facilitate the process of the voluntary and safe return, resettlement and reintegration of refugees, as reaffirmed in the agreements reached at Nairobi, Bujumbura and Cairo in 1995 and at Tunis and Arusha in 1996, and urging Governments in the region to work, in cooperation with the international community, to find durable solutions to the refugee crisis,

	Stressing its concern that the United Nations should continue to play an active role in assisting the Government of Rwanda in facilitating the voluntary and orderly return of refugees and the reintegration of returnees, in promoting reconciliation, in consolidating a climate of confidence and stability, and in promoting the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Rwanda,

	Reaffirming the link between the voluntary return of refugees to their homes and the normalization of the situation in Rwanda, and concerned that acts of intimidation and violence directed against refugees, particularly by the former Rwandan authorities, have prevented refugees from returning to their homes,

	Noting the United Nations support for all efforts to reduce tension and restore stability in the Great Lakes region, including initiatives of the Organization of African Unity, States in the region and international organizations, and reiterating the urgent need for an international conference on peace, security and development in the Great Lakes region, under the auspices of the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, to address the problems of the region in a comprehensive manner,

	4.	Reaffirms that all persons who committed or authorized acts of genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law and those who are responsible for grave violations of human rights are individually responsible and accountable for those violations, and that the international community must exert every effort, in cooperation with national and international tribunals, to bring those responsible to justice, in accordance with international principles of due process;

	5.	Urges all States to cooperate fully, without delay, with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States, between 1 January and 31 December 1994, taking into account the obligations contained in Security Council resolutions 955 (1994) of 8 November 1994 and 978 (1995) of 27 February 1995, and encourages the Secretary-General to facilitate the activities of the Tribunal to the greatest extent possible;

	11.	Notes with deep concern the reports of the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda which state that government officials without legal authority to arrest or imprison continue to do so in several parts of the country, that detainees are held for very long periods before trial and that acute overcrowding threatens the safety of those in detention;

	12.	Invites the Government of Rwanda to continue efforts to involve, without any discrimination, all citizens not responsible for genocide or other grave violations of international humanitarian law in its administrative, judicial, political and security structures;

	13.	Emphasizes the importance it attaches to the safety and security of all people in Rwanda, including United Nations personnel and other international staff serving in the country;

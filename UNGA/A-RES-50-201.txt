	Noting the ongoing efforts to ensure a coordinated follow-up to major international conferences in the economic, social and related fields,

	Recognizing that the interdependence of democracy, development and respect for human rights, as stated in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, requires a comprehensive and integrated approach to the promotion and protection of human rights,

	Recalling that in its resolution 48/141 the General Assembly decided to create the post of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights as the United Nations official with principal responsibility for United Nations human rights activities, including coordination of the human rights promotion and protection activities throughout the United Nations system,

	Noting that at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination, in April 1994, the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of the United Nations organs, bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights, as set out in resolution 48/141,

	Noting also that the High Commissioner has established a permanent dialogue with the United Nations programmes and agencies whose activities deal with human rights in order to maintain systematic exchanges of information, experience and expertise,

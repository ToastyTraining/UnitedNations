	Annex

	UNITED NATIONS DECLARATION AGAINST CORRUPTION AND BRIBERY
	IN INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS

	The General Assembly,

	Convinced that a stable and transparent environment for international commercial transactions in all countries is essential for the mobilization of investment, finance, technology, skills and other important resources across national borders, in order, inter alia, to promote economic and social development and environmental protection,

	Recognizing the need to promote social responsibility and appropriate standards of ethics on the part of private and public corporations, including transnational corporations, and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions, inter alia, through observance of the laws and regulations of the countries in which they conduct business, and taking into account the impact of their activities on economic and social development and environmental protection,

	Recognizing also that effective efforts at all levels to combat and avoid corruption and bribery in all countries are essential elements of an improved international business environment, that they enhance fairness and competitiveness in international commercial transactions and form a critical part of promoting transparent and accountable governance, economic and social development and environmental protection in all countries, and that such efforts are especially pressing in the increasingly competitive globalized international economy,

	Solemnly proclaims the United Nations Declaration against Corruption and Bribery in International Commercial Transactions as set out below.

	Member States, individually and through international and regional organizations, taking actions subject to each State's own constitution and fundamental legal principles and adopted pursuant to national laws and procedures, commit themselves:

	1.	To take effective and concrete action to combat all forms of corruption, bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions, in particular to pursue effective enforcement of existing laws prohibiting bribery in international commercial transactions, to encourage the adoption of laws for those purposes where they do not exist, and to call upon private and public corporations, including transnational corporations, and individuals within their jurisdiction engaged in international commercial transactions to promote the objectives of the present Declaration;

	2.	To criminalize such bribery of foreign public officials in an effective and coordinated manner, but without in any way precluding, impeding or delaying international, regional or national actions to further the implementation of the present Declaration;

	3.	Bribery may include, inter alia, the following elements:

	(a)	The offer, promise or giving of any payment, gift or other advantage, directly or indirectly, by any private or public corporation, including a transnational corporation, or individual from a State to any public official or elected representative of another country as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official's or representative's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction;

	(b)	The soliciting, demanding, accepting or receiving, directly or indirectly, by any public official or elected representative of a State from any private or public corporation, including a transnational corporation, or individual from another country of any payment, gift or other advantage, as undue consideration for performing or refraining from the performance of that official's or representative's duties in connection with an international commercial transaction;

	4.	To deny, in countries that do not already do so, the tax deductibility of bribes paid by any private or public corporation or individual of a State to any public official or elected representative of another country and, to that end, to examine their respective modalities for doing so;


	5.	To develop or maintain accounting standards and practices that improve the transparency of international commercial transactions, and that encourage private and public corporations, including transnational corporations, and individuals engaged in international commercial transactions to avoid and combat corruption, bribery and related illicit practices;

	6.	To develop or to encourage the development, as appropriate, of business codes, standards or best practices that prohibit corruption, bribery and related illicit practices in international commercial transactions;

	7.	To examine establishing illicit enrichment by public officials or elected representatives as an offence; 

	8.	To cooperate and afford one another the greatest possible assistance in connection with criminal investigations and other legal proceedings brought in respect of corruption and bribery in international commercial transactions.  Mutual assistance shall include, as far as permitted under national laws or as provided for in bilateral treaties or other applicable arrangements of the affected countries, and taking into account the need for confidentiality as appropriate:

	(a)	Production of documents and other information, taking of evidence and service of documents relevant to criminal investigations and other legal proceedings;

	(b)	Notice of the initiation and outcome of criminal proceedings concerning bribery in international commercial transactions to other States that may have jurisdiction over the same offence;

	(c)	Extradition proceedings where and as appropriate;

	9.	To take appropriate action to enhance cooperation to facilitate access to documents and records about transactions and about identities of persons engaged in bribery in international commercial transactions;

	10.	To ensure that bank secrecy provisions do not impede or hinder criminal investigations or other legal proceedings relating to corruption, bribery or related illicit practices in international commercial transactions, and that full cooperation is extended to Governments that seek information on such transactions;

	11.	Actions taken in furtherance of the present Declaration shall respect fully the national sovereignty and territorial jurisdiction of Member States, as well as the rights and obligations of Member States under existing treaties and international law, and shall be consistent with human rights and fundamental freedoms;

	12.	Member States agree that actions taken by them to establish jurisdiction over acts of bribery of foreign public officials in international commercial transactions shall be consistent with the principles of international law regarding the extraterritorial application of a State's laws.

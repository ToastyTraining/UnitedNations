	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Second Committee (A/51/602)]


51/168.Transit environment in the landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours

	The General Assembly,
	
	Recalling its resolutions 48/169 and 48/170 of 21 December 1993 and 49/102 of 19 December 1994,

	Recalling also the agreed conclusions and recommendations of the first1 and the second2 Meeting of Governmental Experts from Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Representatives of Donor Countries and Financial and Development Institutions, held in New York from 17 to 19 May 1993 and from 19 to 22 June 1995, respectively, and in particular the conclusions and recommendations of those meetings pertaining to the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours,

	Recognizing that the overall socio-economic development efforts of newly independent and developing landlocked States, seeking to enter world markets through the establishment of a multicountry transit system, are impeded by a lack of territorial access to the sea as well as by remoteness and isolation from world markets,

	Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral, bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region,


	Considering that the outcome of the Symposium for Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries, held in New York from 14 to 16 June 1995, in particular the document entitled "Global framework for transit transport cooperation between landlocked and transit developing countries and the donor community",3 is a practical contribution to the development objectives and efforts of the United Nations,   

	Taking note of the progress report of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development on measures designed to improve the transit transport environment in Central Asia,4 and considering that the problems of transit transport facing the Central Asian region need to be seen against the backdrop of economic changes and the accompanying challenges, including especially the impact of those changes on the international and intraregional trade of the countries concerned,

	Recognizing that, to be effective, a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new, alternative routes,

	Emphasizing the importance of strengthening international support measures to address further the problems of the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours,

	1.	Takes note of the results of the Technical Meeting on Central Asia's Transit Transport Links with World Markets,5 held at Ankara from 7 to 9 November 1995, under the auspices of the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development;  

	2.	Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned, in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources, to continue elaborating a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours;

 	3.	Invites donor countries and multilateral financial and development institutions, within their mandates, to provide newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours with appropriate financial and technical assistance for the improvement of the transit environment for those countries;


	4.	Calls upon the United Nations system to continue studying, within the scope of the implementation of the present resolution, possible ways of promoting more effective cooperative arrangements between landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit neighbours and to encourage a more active supportive role on the part of the donor community;

	5.	Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to prepare a report on the implementation of the present resolution, to be submitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session.

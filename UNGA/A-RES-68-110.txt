	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 2099 (XX) of 20 December 1965, in which the General Assembly established the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law to contribute towards a better knowledge of international law as a means of strengthening international peace and security and promoting friendly relations and cooperation among States,
	Reaffirming that the Programme of Assistance is a core activity of the United Nations and that it has provided the foundation for the efforts of the United Nations to promote a better knowledge of international law for nearly half a century,
	Recognizing the major contribution of the Programme of Assistance to the teaching and dissemination of international law for the benefit of lawyers in all countries, legal systems and regions of the world for almost half a century,
	Emphasizing the important contribution of the Programme of Assistance, in particular the United Nations Regional Courses in International Law and the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law, to the furtherance of United Nations rule of law programmes and activities,
	Reaffirming that the increasing demand for international law training and dissemination activities creates new challenges for the Programme of Assistance,
	Recognizing the importance of the Programme of Assistance effectively reaching its beneficiaries, including with regard to languages, while bearing in mind limitations on available resources,
	Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the Programme of Assistance1 and the views of the Advisory Committee on the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law, which are contained in the report,2
	Noting with concern that the activities of the Programme of Assistance, in particular the organization of the United Nations Regional Courses in International Law on a regular basis and the further development of the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law, cannot be sustained with the resources available under the current or the proposed programme budget, notwithstanding its resolutions 64/113 of 16 December 2009, 65/25 of 6 December 2010, 66/97 of 9 December 2011 and 67/91 of 14 December 2012,
	Noting with regret that the United Nations Regional Course in International Law for Asia-Pacific for 2013 was cancelled owing to insufficient funds and that no United Nations Regional Course in International Law for Latin America and the Caribbean has been held in almost a decade,
	Considering that international law should occupy an appropriate place in the teaching of legal disciplines at all universities,

	Reaffirming that in the conduct of the Programme of Assistance it would be desirable to use as far as possible the resources and facilities made available by Member States, international and regional organizations, universities, institutions and others,

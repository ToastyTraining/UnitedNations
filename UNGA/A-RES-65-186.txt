65/186.	Realizing the Millennium Development Goals for persons with disabilities towards 2015 and beyond


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons,1 the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities2 and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,3 in which persons with disabilities are recognized as both development agents and beneficiaries in all aspects of development,
	Recalling also its previous resolutions on the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, in which it recognized the collective responsibility of Governments to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality and equity at the global level, and stressing the duty of Member States to achieve greater justice and equality for all, in particular persons with disabilities,
	Reaffirming its previous resolutions, in particular resolution 64/131 of 18 December 2009 on realizing the Millennium Development Goals for persons with disabilities and resolution 63/150 of 18 December 2008 on realizing the Millennium Development Goals for persons with disabilities through the implementation of the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,
	Encouraged by the outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals,4 which calls for enhanced and concrete efforts to realize the Goals for all, including persons with disabilities,
	Gravely concerned that persons with disabilities are often subject to multiple or aggravated forms of discrimination and are still largely invisible in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Millennium Development Goals,
	Affirming that a role of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which is both a human rights treaty and a development tool, is to provide an opportunity to strengthen the policies related to the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, thereby contributing to the realization of a "society for all" in the twenty-first century,
	Affirming also that the World Programme of Action and the Standard Rules enhance the policies related to the realization of the Millennium Development Goals,
	Noting that persons with disabilities make up an estimated 10 per cent of the world's population, of whom 80 per cent live in developing countries, and recognizing the importance of international cooperation and its promotion in support of national efforts, in particular for developing countries,
	Concerned that the lack of data and information on disability and the situation of persons with disabilities at the national level contributes to the invisibility of persons with disabilities in official statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving development planning and implementation that is inclusive of persons with disabilities,
	1.	Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General entitled "Keeping the promise: realizing the Millennium Development Goals for persons with disabilities towards 2015 and beyond",5 and of the recommendations contained therein, and notes that the report contains options to update the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons;1
	2.	Notes that the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities3 emphasizes the importance of international cooperation for improving the living conditions of persons with disabilities in every country, particularly in developing countries; 
	3.	Also notes that the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities provides comprehensive coverage of the civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights of persons with disabilities;
	4.	Welcomes the outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly, entitled "Keeping the promise: united to achieve the Millennium Development Goals",4 particularly the recognition that policies and actions must also focus on persons with disabilities so that they benefit from progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals;
	5.	Urges Member States, and invites international organizations and regional organizations, regional integration organizations, financial institutions, the private sector and civil society, in particular organizations representing persons with disabilities, as appropriate, to promote the realization of the Millennium Development Goals for persons with disabilities by, inter alia, explicitly including and mainstreaming disability issues and persons with disabilities in national plans and tools designed to contribute to the full realization of the Goals;
	6.	Urges the United Nations system to make a concerted effort to integrate disability issues into its work, and in this regard encourages the Inter-Agency Support Group on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to continue working to ensure that development programmes, including Millennium Development Goals policies, processes and mechanisms, are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities;
	7.	Encourages Member States to ensure that their international cooperation, including through international development programmes, is inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities;
	8.	Calls upon Governments and United Nations bodies and agencies to include disability issues and persons with disabilities in reviewing progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and to step up efforts to include in their assessment the extent to which persons with disabilities are able to benefit from efforts to achieve the Goals; 
	9.	Calls upon Governments to enable persons with disabilities to participate as agents and beneficiaries of development, in particular in all efforts aimed at achieving the Millennium Development Goals, by ensuring that programmes and policies, namely on eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary education, promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women, reducing child mortality, improving maternal health, combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases, ensuring environmental sustainability and developing a global partnership for development, are inclusive of and accessible to persons with disabilities;
	10.	Emphasizes the importance of the full participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities, including through information in accessible formats at all levels of policymaking and development, which is critical to informing policymakers on the situation of persons with disabilities, the barriers they may face and ways to overcome obstacles to the full and equal enjoyment of their rights, to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals for all, including persons with disabilities, and to their socio-economic advancement;
	11.	Encourages international cooperation in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, including through global partnerships for development, which are crucial for the realization of the Goals for all, in particular for persons with disabilities;
	12.	Encourages Governments to develop and accelerate the exchange of information, guidelines, standards, best practices, legislative measures and government policies regarding the situation of persons with disabilities and disability issues, in particular as they relate to inclusion and accessibility;
	13.	Calls upon Governments to strengthen the collection and compilation of national data and information about the situation of persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics6 that are disaggregated by sex and age, which could be used by Governments to enable their development policy planning, monitoring, evaluation and implementation to be disability-sensitive, in particular in the realization of the Millennium Development Goals for persons with disabilities, and invites Governments to provide, where available, relevant data and statistics to the appropriate mechanisms within the United Nations system, including the Statistical Commission;
	14.	Requests the United Nations system to facilitate technical assistance, within existing resources, including the provision of assistance for capacity-building and for the collection and compilation of national and regional data and statistics on disability, in particular to developing countries, and in this regard requests the Secretary-General, in accordance with existing guidelines on disability statistics, to analyse, publish and disseminate disability data and statistics in future periodic reports, as appropriate, on the realization of the Millennium Development Goals for persons with disabilities;

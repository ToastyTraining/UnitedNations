	72/113.	Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its fiftieth session


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966, by which it established the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law with a mandate to further the progressive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade and in that respect to bear in mind the interests of all peoples, in particular those of developing countries, in the extensive development of international trade,
	Reaffirming its belief that the progressive modernization and harmonization of international trade law, in reducing or removing legal obstacles to the flow of international trade, especially those affecting developing countries, would contribute significantly to universal economic cooperation among all States on a basis of equality, equity, common interest and respect for the rule of law, to the elimination of discrimination in international trade and, thereby, to peace, stability and the well-being of all peoples,
	Having considered the report of the Commission,1 
	Reiterating its concern that activities undertaken by other bodies in the field of international trade law without adequate coordination with the Commission might lead to undesirable duplication of efforts and would not be in keeping with the aim of promoting efficiency, consistency and coherence in the unification and harmonization of international trade law,
	Reaffirming the mandate of the Commission, as the core legal body within the United Nations system in the field of international trade law, to coordinate legal activities in this field, in particular to avoid duplication of efforts, including among organizations formulating rules of international trade, and to promote efficiency, consistency and coherence in the modernization and harmonization of international trade law, and to continue, through its secretariat, to maintain close cooperation with other international organs and organizations, including regional organizations, active in the field of international trade law,

	2.	Commends the Commission for the finalization and adoption of the Model Law on Electronic Transferable Records;2

	4.	Congratulates the Commission on its fiftieth anniversary, and notes with satisfaction that the Congress to commemorate the anniversary, held in Vienna from 4 to 6 July 2017 during the fiftieth session of the Commission, entitled "Modernizing International Trade Law to Support Innovation and Sustainable Development", acknowledged the centrality of international cooperation and coordination to the achievements of the Commission, elicited innovative ideas for modernizing international trade law in a sustainable manner that could not only raise awareness of the work of the Commission and its potential to support cross-border commerce but also contribute to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,4 and emphasized the leading role played by the Commission in providing an inclusive, transparent and multilateral forum in which to address the legal challenges facing international trade, and requests the Secretary-General to ensure the publication of the proceedings of the Congress to the extent permitted by available resources;

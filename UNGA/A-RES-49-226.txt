	Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978, by which the Council established the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force, the latest of which was resolution 938 (1994) of
28 July 1994,

	Recalling its resolution S-8/2 of 21 April 1978 on the financing of the Force and its subsequent resolutions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 48/254 of 26 May 1994,

	Affirming that the costs of the Force are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Reaffirming its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

		Decides that there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 7 above, their respective share in the estimated income of 10,000 dollars other than staff assessment income approved for the period from 1 February to 31 July 1995, inclusive;

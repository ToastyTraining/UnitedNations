[on the report of the First Committee (A/71/450)] 
71/70.	Effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium 


	The General Assembly, 
	Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international humanitarian law,
	Recalling its resolutions 62/30 of 5 December 2007, 63/54 of 2 December 2008, 65/55 of 8 December 2010, 67/36 of 3 December 2012 and 69/57 of 2 December 2014, 
	Determined to promote multilateralism as an essential means to carry forward negotiations on arms regulation and disarmament, 
	Taking note of the opinions expressed by Member States and relevant international organizations on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium, as reflected in the reports submitted by the Secretary-General pursuant to resolutions 62/30, 63/54, 65/55, 67/36 and 69/57,1 
	Recognizing the importance of implementing, as appropriate, the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Health Organization to mitigate potential hazards to human beings and the environment from the contamination of territories with depleted uranium residues, 
	Considering that studies conducted so far by relevant international organizations have not provided a detailed enough account of the magnitude of the potential long-term effects on human beings and the environment of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium, 
	Recalling that the United Nations Environment Programme, in its report to the Secretary-General on the subject,2 affirms that major scientific uncertainties persist regarding the long-term environmental impacts of depleted uranium, particularly with respect to long-term groundwater contamination, and calls for a precautionary approach to the use of depleted uranium, 
	Convinced that, as humankind becomes more aware of the need to take immediate measures to protect the environment, any event that could jeopardize such efforts requires urgent attention to implement the required measures, 
	Noting that further research should be done to assess the health risks and environmental impact of the use of arms and ammunitions containing depleted uranium in conflict situations, 
	Noting also the technical and financial barriers faced by affected States seeking to implement post-conflict remedial measures that meet international standards for radioactive waste management for locations, infrastructure and materiel contaminated by arms and ammunitions containing depleted uranium, 
	Taking into consideration the potential harmful effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium on human health and the environment, and the ongoing concerns of affected States and communities, health experts and civil society about such effects, 
	1.	Expresses its appreciation to the Member States and international organizations that submitted their views to the Secretary-General pursuant to resolution 69/57 and previous resolutions on the subject; 
	2.	Invites Member States and relevant international organizations, particularly those that have not yet done so, to communicate to the Secretary-General their views on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium; 
	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to request relevant international organizations to update and complete, as appropriate, their studies and research on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium on human health and the environment; 
	4.	Encourages Member States, particularly the affected States, as necessary, to facilitate the studies and research referred to in paragraph 3 above; 
	5.	Also encourages Member States to follow closely the development of the studies and research referred to in paragraph 3 above; 
	6.	Invites Member States that have used armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium in armed conflicts to provide the relevant authorities of affected States, upon request, with information, as detailed as possible, about the location of the areas of use and the amounts used, with the objective of facilitating the assessment and clearance of such areas; 
	7.	Encourages Member States in a position to do so to provide assistance to States affected by the use of arms and ammunitions containing depleted uranium, in particular in identifying and managing contaminated sites and material; 
	8.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit an updated report on the subject to the General Assembly at its seventy-third session, reflecting the information submitted by Member States and relevant international organizations, including the information submitted pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 above; 
	9.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-third session, under the item entitled "General and complete disarmament", the sub-item entitled "Effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium".

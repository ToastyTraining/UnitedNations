	Recognizing that Member States bear the primary responsibility to respect and ensure the human rights of all persons within their territory and subject to their jurisdiction as provided for by international law,
	Recalling its resolution 62/214 of 21 December 2007 on the United Nations Comprehensive Strategy on Assistance and Support to Victims of Sexual Exploitation and Abuse by United Nations Staff and Related Personnel and section IV of resolution 66/264 of 21 June 2012, on special measures for protection from sexual exploitation and sexual abuse, reaffirming the need for full implementation of the United Nations policy of zero tolerance of sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping operations, and recognizing the role of United Nations peacekeeping contingents in preventing sexual violence,

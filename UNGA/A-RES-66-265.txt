	15.	Encourages the Secretary-General to determine what constitutes a core or basic capacity to effectively manage and backstop peacekeeping operations and to report his findings in the context of the budget proposal for the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2013 to 30 June 2014;

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolutions 44/106 of 15 December 1989, 45/50 of 4 December 1990, 46/28 of 6 December 1991, 47/46 of 9 December 1992 and 48/69 of 16 December 1993,

	Reiterating its conviction that a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is the highest-priority measure for the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and for the achievement of the objective of nuclear disarmament,

	Recalling the central role of the United Nations in the field of nuclear disarmament and in particular in the cessation of all nuclear-test explosions, as well as the persistent efforts of non-governmental organizations in the achievement of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty,

	Conscious of the growing environmental concerns throughout the world and of the past and potential negative effects of nuclear testing on the environment,

	Recalling its resolution 1910 (XVIII) of 27 November 1963, in which it noted with approval the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, 1/ signed on 5 August 1963, and requested the

95-76009
Conference of the Eighteen-Nation Committee on Disarmament 2/ to continue with a sense of urgency its negotiations to achieve the objectives set forth in the preamble to the Treaty, 

	Recalling also that more than one third of the parties to the Treaty requested the depositary Governments to convene a conference to consider an amendment that would convert the Treaty into a comprehensive test-ban treaty,

	Recalling further that a substantive session of the Amendment Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water was held in New York from 7 to 18 January 1991,

	Reiterating its conviction that the Amendment Conference will facilitate the attainment of the objectives set forth in the Treaty and thus serve to strengthen it,

	Noting with satisfaction the unilateral nuclear-test moratoriums announced by several nuclear-weapon States,

	Welcoming the decision of the Conference on Disarmament to give its Ad Hoc Committee on a Nuclear Test Ban a mandate to negotiate a comprehensive test ban, 3/

	Recalling its recommendation that arrangements be made to ensure that intensive efforts continue, under the auspices of the Amendment Conference, until a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is achieved, and its call that all parties participate in, and contribute to the success of, the Amendment Conference,

	Recalling also the decision adopted by the Amendment Conference 4/ to the effect that, since further work needed to be undertaken on certain aspects of a comprehensive test-ban treaty, especially those with regard to verification of compliance and possible sanctions against non-compliance, the President of the Conference should conduct consultations with a view to achieving progress on those issues and to resuming the work of the Conference at an appropriate time,

	Welcoming also the ongoing efforts being conducted by the President of the Amendment Conference,

__________

	2/	On 26 August 1969, the Conference of the Eighteen-Nation Committee on Disarmament decided to change its name to the Conference of the Committee on Disarmament.  That negotiating body became the Committee on Disarmament as from the tenth special session of the General Assembly.  The Committee on Disarmament was redesignated the Conference on Disarmament as from 7 February 1984.

		Recalling finally the concluding statement 5/ made by the President of the Amendment Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water at the special meeting of States parties held on 10 August 1993, in which broad agreement was found for:

	(a)	Pursuing work for a comprehensive test ban in the Amendment Conference and the Conference on Disarmament in a mutually supportive and mutually complementary manner,

	(b)	Holding another special meeting early in 1994 to review developments and assess the situation regarding a comprehensive test ban and to examine the feasibility of resuming the work of the Amendment Conference later that year,


	(c)	Promoting universality of a comprehensive test ban by having the President of the Amendment Conference liaise closely with the Conference on Disarmament and the five nuclear-weapon States,

	1.	Notes with satisfaction that in 1994 the Conference on Disarmament initiated the multilateral negotiation of a universal and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear-test ban, which would contribute effectively to the prevention of proliferation in all its aspects, to the process of nuclear disarmament and therefore to the enhancement of international peace and security;

	2.	Notes the intention of the President of the Conference to convene, after appropriate consultations and in the light of the work carried out by the Conference on Disarmament, another special meeting of the States parties to the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water, as envisaged by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/69, to review developments and assess the situation regarding a comprehensive test ban and to examine the feasibility of resuming the work of the Amendment Conference;

	3.	Recommends that arrangements be made to ensure the fullest possible participation of non-governmental organizations in the Amendment Conference;

	4.	Reiterates its conviction that, pending the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty, the nuclear-weapon States should suspend all nuclear-test explosions through an agreed moratorium or unilateral moratoriums;

	5.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fiftieth session the item entitled "Amendment of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water".

	Welcoming also the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and its Committee on Fisheries, and recognizing in particular the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (the Code) and other related instruments, including the international plans of action, which set out principles and global standards of behaviour for responsible practices for conservation of fisheries resources and the management and development of fisheries, as well as the 2005 Rome Declaration on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing,
	Welcoming further the outcomes, including the decisions and recommendations, of the thirtieth session of the Committee on Fisheries, held in Rome from 9 to 13 July 2012,4
	Noting with concern that effective management of marine capture fisheries has been made difficult in some areas by unreliable information and data caused by, inter alia, unreported and misreported fish catch and fishing effort and that this lack of accurate data contributes to overfishing in some areas,
	Recognizing the significant contribution of sustainable fisheries to food security, income, wealth and poverty alleviation for present and future generations,

	Deploring the fact that fish stocks, including straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, in many parts of the world are overfished or subject to sparsely regulated and heavy fishing efforts, as a result of, inter alia, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, inadequate flag State control and enforcement, including monitoring, control and surveillance measures, inadequate regulatory measures, harmful fisheries subsidies and overcapacity, as well as inadequate port State control, as highlighted in the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2012,
	Expressing its support for accelerating work to complete the ongoing negotiations in the World Trade Organization to strengthen disciplines on subsidies in the fisheries sector, including through the prohibition of certain forms of fisheries subsidies that contribute to overcapacity and overfishing,

	Recalling the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,
	Particularly concerned that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing constitutes a serious threat to fish stocks and marine habitats and ecosystems, to the detriment of sustainable fisheries as well as the food security and the economies of many States, particularly developing States,
	Concerned that some operators increasingly take advantage of the globalization of fishery markets to trade fishery products stemming from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and make economic profits from those operations, which constitutes an incentive for them to pursue their activities,
	Recognizing that effective deterrence and combating of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has significant financial and other resource implications,
	Recognizing also the duty provided in the Convention, the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (the Compliance Agreement),7 the Agreement and the Code for flag States to exercise effective control over fishing vessels flying their flag, and vessels flying their flag which provide support to fishing vessels, to ensure that the activities of such fishing and support vessels do not undermine the effectiveness of conservation and management measures taken in accordance with international law and adopted at the national, subregional, regional or global levels,

	Recognizing that marine debris is a global transboundary pollution problem and that, due to the many different types and sources of marine debris, different approaches to their prevention and removal are necessary, including identification of such sources,
	Noting that the contribution of sustainable aquaculture to global fish supplies continues to respond to opportunities in developing countries to enhance local food security and poverty alleviation and, together with the efforts of other aquaculture-producing countries, will make a significant contribution to meeting future demands in fish consumption, bearing in mind article 9 of the Code,
	Reaffirming the importance of sustainable aquaculture to food security, and concerned about the potential effects of genetically engineered aquatic fish species on the health and sustainability of wild fish stocks,
	Calling attention to the particular vulnerabilities of small island developing States, other developing coastal States and subsistence fishing communities whose livelihoods, economic development and food security are heavily dependent on sustainable fisheries and will suffer disproportionately if sustainable fisheries are negatively affected,
	Calling attention also to the circumstances affecting fisheries in many developing States, in particular African States and small island developing States, and recognizing the urgent need for capacity-building, including the transfer of marine technology and in particular fisheries-related technology, to enhance the ability of such States to exercise their rights in order to realize the benefits from fisheries resources and fulfil their obligations under international instruments,
	Recognizing the need to adopt, implement and enforce appropriate measures to minimize by-catch, waste, discards, including high-grading, loss of fishing gear and other factors that adversely affect the sustainability of fish stocks and ecosystems and, consequently, can also have harmful effects on the economies and food security of small island developing States, other developing coastal States and subsistence fishing communities,

	Recognizing further the economic and cultural importance of sharks in many countries, the biological importance of sharks in the marine ecosystem as key predatory species, the vulnerability of certain shark species to overexploitation, the fact that some are threatened with extinction, the need for measures to promote the long-term conservation, management and sustainable use of shark populations and fisheries, and the relevance of the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 1999, in providing guidance on the development of such measures,
	Welcoming in this regard the review by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations of the implementation of the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, and its ongoing work in this regard,
	Noting with concern that basic data on shark stocks and harvests continue to be lacking and that not all regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements have adopted conservation and management measures for directed shark fisheries and for the regulation of by-catch of sharks from other fisheries,

	56.	Urges regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to further coordinate measures for combating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities, such as through the development of a common list of vessels identified as engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing or the mutual recognition of the illegal, unreported and unregulated vessel lists established by each organization or arrangement;
	57.	Reaffirms its call upon States to take all necessary measures consistent with international law, without prejudice to a State's sovereignty over ports in its territory and to reasons of force majeure or distress, including the prohibition of vessels from accessing their ports followed by a report to the flag State concerned, when there is clear evidence that they are or have been engaged in or have supported illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, or when they refuse to give information either on the origin of the catch or on the authorization under which the catch has been made;
	58.	Reaffirms paragraph 53 of resolution 64/72 of 4 December 2009 with regard to eliminating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing by vessels flying "flags of convenience" and requiring that a "genuine link" be established between States and fishing vessels flying their flags, and urges States operating open registry to effectively control all fishing vessels flying their flag, as required by international law, or otherwise stop open registry for fishing vessels;

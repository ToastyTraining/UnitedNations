	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[without reference to a Main Committee (A/48/L.5 and Add.1)]


		48/7.Assistance in mine clearance


	The General Assembly,

	Gravely alarmed by the increasing presence of mines and other unexploded devices resulting from armed conflicts,

	Dismayed by the high number of victims of mines, especially among civilian populations, and taking note in this context of resolution 1993/83 of the Commission on Human Rights of 10 March 1993, 1/ on the effects of armed conflicts on children's lives,

	Gravely concerned by the serious humanitarian, social, economic and ecological disruption which can be caused by the failure to remove mines and other unexploded devices,

	Bearing in mind the serious threat which mines and other unexploded devices pose to the safety, the health and the lives of personnel participating in humanitarian, peace-keeping and rehabilitation operations,

	Aware that mines constitute an obstacle to reconstruction and economic development as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions,

	Considering that, in addition to the responsibilities incumbent upon States, there is scope for the United Nations to strengthen its contribution to the solution of problems relating to mine clearance,

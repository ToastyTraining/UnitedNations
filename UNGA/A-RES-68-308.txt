	Recalling World Health Assembly resolutions 60.18 of 23 May 2007 and 64.17 of 24 May 2011, urging a broad range of national and international actions to scale up malaria control programmes,3 and resolution 61.18 of 24 May 2008 on monitoring the achievement of health-related Millennium Development Goals,4 
	Recalling also the commitment made by African leaders to end the epidemic of malaria by ensuring universal and equitable access to quality health care and by improving health systems and health financing, contained in the African Common Position on the post-2015 development agenda, 
	Bearing in mind the relevant resolutions of the Economic and Social Council relating to the struggle against malaria and diarrhoeal diseases, in particular resolution 1998/36 of 30 July 1998,
	Taking note of all declarations and decisions on health issues, in particular those related to malaria, adopted by the Organization of African Unity and the African Union, including the Abuja Declaration on HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Other Related Infectious Diseases, containing the pledge to allocate at least 15 per cent of national budgets to the health sector, the Abuja call for accelerated action towards universal access to HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria services in Africa, issued by the Heads of State and Government of the African Union at the special summit of the African Union on HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, held in Abuja from 2 to 4 May 2006, the decision of the Assembly of the African Union at its fifteenth ordinary session, held in Kampala from 25 to 27 July 2010, to extend the Abuja call to 2015 to coincide with the Millennium Development Goals, and the declaration of the special summit of the African Union on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, held in Abuja from 12 to 16 July 2013,
	Recognizing the leadership provided by the African Leaders Malaria Alliance and the continued commitment to help to achieve the 2015 targets, and encouraging the members of the Alliance to continue to provide political leadership at the highest level in the fight against malaria in Africa,

	Welcoming the selection by the Secretary-General of malaria as one of the top priorities of his second mandate and his commitment to develop new partnerships and improve existing ones and to scale up high-impact interventions aimed at significantly reducing the number of deaths from malaria,
	Recognizing the linkages among efforts being made to reach the targets set at the Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held in Abuja on 24 and 25 April 2000, as necessary and important for the attainment of the "Roll Back Malaria" goal5 and the targets of the Millennium Development Goals by 2010 and 2015, respectively, and welcoming in this regard the commitment of Member States to respond to the specific needs of Africa,
	Recognizing also that malaria-related ill health and deaths throughout the world can be substantially reduced with political commitment and commensurate resources if the public is educated and sensitized about malaria and appropriate health services are made available, particularly in countries where the disease is endemic,
	Recognizing further that malaria control interventions have a positive impact on overall child and maternal mortality rates and could help African countries and other malaria-endemic countries to reach Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 of reducing child mortality and improving maternal health, respectively, by 2015,

	Recognizing that, despite the fact that increased global and national investments in malaria control have yielded significant results in decreasing the burden of malaria in many countries and that some countries are moving towards the elimination of malaria, many countries continue to have unacceptably high burdens of malaria and in order to reach internationally agreed development goals, including the health-related Millennium Development Goals, must rapidly increase malaria prevention and control efforts, which rely heavily on medicines and insecticides whose utility is continuously threatened by the development of resistance in humans to antimalarial agents, as well as resistance of mosquitoes to insecticides,
	Aware that recent successes in prevention and control are fragile and can be maintained only with sufficient and sustained national and international investment to fund global malaria control efforts fully,
	Recognizing the serious challenges relating to substandard, falsified and counterfeit drugs, as well as poor malaria diagnostics,

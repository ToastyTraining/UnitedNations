	Recalling the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ("the Convention"),2 and bearing in mind the relationship between the Convention and the Agreement,
	Recognizing that, in accordance with the Convention, the Agreement sets forth provisions concerning the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, including provisions on compliance and enforcement by the flag State and subregional and regional cooperation in enforcement, binding dispute settlement and the rights and obligations of States in authorizing the use of vessels flying their flags for fishing on the high seas, and specific provisions to address the requirements of developing States in relation to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and the development of fisheries for such stocks,
	Welcoming the fact that a growing number of States, and entities referred to in the Convention and in article 1, paragraph 2 (b), of the Agreement, as well as regional and subregional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, have taken measures, as appropriate, towards the implementation of the provisions of the Agreement, 
	Welcoming also the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and its Committee on Fisheries and the 2005 Rome Declaration on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, adopted by the Ministerial Meeting on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations on 12 March 2005,3 which calls for effective implementation of the various instruments already developed to ensure responsible fisheries, and recognizing that the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ("the Code")4 and its associated international plans of action set out principles and global standards of behaviour for responsible practices for conservation of fisheries resources and the management and development of fisheries,
	Noting with concern that effective management of marine capture fisheries has been made difficult in some areas by unreliable information and data caused by unreported and misreported fish catch and fishing effort and this lack of accurate data contributes to overfishing in some areas, and therefore welcoming the adoption of the Strategy for Improving Information on Status and Trends of Capture Fisheries5 and the development of the Fishery Resources Monitoring System (FIRMS) initiative by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to improve knowledge and understanding of fishery status and trends,
	Recognizing the significant contribution of sustainable fisheries to food security, income and wealth for present and future generations,
	Recognizing also the urgent need for action at all levels to ensure the long-term sustainable use and management of fisheries resources through the wide application of the precautionary approach, 
	Deploring the fact that fish stocks, including straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, in many parts of the world are overfished or subject to sparsely regulated and heavy fishing efforts, as a result of, inter alia, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, inadequate flag State control and enforcement, including monitoring, control and surveillance measures, inadequate regulatory measures, harmful fisheries subsidies and overcapacity,
	Particularly concerned that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing constitutes a serious threat to fish stocks and marine habitats and ecosystems, to the detriment of sustainable fisheries as well as the food security and the economies of many States, particularly developing States,
	Recognizing the duty provided in the Convention, the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas ("the Compliance Agreement"),6 the Agreement and the Code for flag States to exercise effective control over fishing vessels flying their flag, and vessels flying their flag which provide support to fishing vessels, to ensure that the activities of such fishing and support vessels do not undermine the effectiveness of conservation and management measures taken in accordance with international law and adopted at the national, subregional, regional or global levels, 
	Noting the obligation of all States, pursuant to the provisions of the Convention, to cooperate in the conservation and management of living marine resources, and recognizing the importance of coordination and cooperation at the global, regional, subregional as well as national levels in the areas, inter alia, of data collection, information-sharing, capacity-building and training for the conservation, management and sustainable development of marine living resources, 
	Noting with appreciation the report of the Review Conference on the Agreement ("the Review Conference"), held in New York from 22 to 26 May 2006,7 and welcoming the adoption of the recommendations therein, which assessed the effectiveness of the Agreement in securing the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks by reviewing and assessing the adequacy of its provisions and proposed means of strengthening the substance and methods of implementation of those provisions in order better to address any continuing problems in the conservation and management of those stocks, and also noting that the Conference agreed that there is a compelling need for all States and subregional and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to ensure the conservation and sustainable use of straddling and highly migratory fish stocks, 
	Noting with satisfaction that the Review Conference agreed to continue the informal consultations of States parties to the Agreement and to keep the Agreement under review through the resumption of the Conference at a date not later than 2011, to be agreed at a future informal consultation of States parties to the Agreement, 
	Calling attention to the need for more work to develop port State measures and schemes, and the critical need for cooperation with developing States to build their capacity in this regard, 
	Concerned that marine pollution from all sources, including vessels and, in particular, land-based sources, constitutes a serious threat to human health and safety, endangers fish stocks, marine biodiversity and marine habitats and has significant costs to local and national economies,
	Recognizing that marine debris is a global transboundary pollution problem and that, due to the many different types and sources of marine debris, different approaches to their prevention and removal are necessary,
	Noting that the contribution of sustainable aquaculture to global fish supplies continues to respond to opportunities in developing countries to enhance local food security and poverty alleviation and, together with efforts of other aquaculture producing countries, will make a significant contribution to meeting future demands in fish consumption, bearing in mind article 9 of the Code, 
	Calling attention to the circumstances affecting fisheries in many developing States, in particular African States and small island developing States, and recognizing the urgent need for capacity-building, including the transfer of marine technology and in particular fisheries-related technology, to enhance the ability of such States to meet their obligations and exercise their rights under international instruments, in order to realize the benefits from fisheries resources, 
	Recognizing the need for appropriate measures to minimize waste, discards, loss of fishing gear and other factors, which adversely affect fish stocks, 
	Recognizing also the importance of applying ecosystem approaches to oceans management and the need to integrate such approaches into fisheries conservation and management, and in this regard welcoming the report of the seventh meeting of the United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea,8 held in New York from 12 to 16 June 2006,
	Recognizing further the economic and cultural importance of sharks in many countries, the biological importance of sharks in the marine ecosystem, the vulnerability of certain shark species to overexploitation, some of which are threatened with extinction, and the need for measures to promote the long-term sustainability of shark populations and fisheries, and the relevance of the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 1999, in providing development guidance of such measures, 
	Reaffirming its support for the initiative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and relevant regional and subregional fisheries management organizations and arrangements on the conservation and management of sharks, while noting with concern that only a small number of countries have implemented the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, 
	Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on the impacts of fishing on vulnerable marine ecosystems: actions taken by States and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to give effect to paragraphs 66 to 69 of General Assembly resolution 59/25 on sustainable fisheries, regarding the impacts of fishing on vulnerable marine ecosystems,9 in particular its useful role in gathering and disseminating information on this issue, 
	Expressing concern that the practice of large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing remains a threat to marine living resources, although the incidence of this practice has continued to be low in most regions of the world's oceans and seas, 
	Emphasizing that efforts should be made to ensure that the implementation of resolution 46/215 in some parts of the world does not result in the transfer to other parts of the world of drift nets that contravene the resolution, 
	Expressing concern over reports of continued losses of seabirds, particularly albatrosses and petrels, as well as other marine species, including sharks, fin-fish species and marine turtles, as a result of incidental mortality in fishing operations, particularly longline fishing, and other activities, while recognizing considerable efforts to reduce by-catch in longline fishing by States and through various regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements,

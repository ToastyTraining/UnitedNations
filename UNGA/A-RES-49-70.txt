	Convinced that the most effective way to achieve an end to nuclear testing is through the conclusion of a universal and internationally and effectively verifiable comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty that will attract the adherence of all States and will contribute to the prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, to the process of nuclear disarmament and therefore to the enhancement of international peace and security,

	Reaffirming the conviction that the exercise of utmost restraint in respect of nuclear testing would be consistent with the negotiation of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty,

95-76015

Water 1/ to seek to achieve the discontinuance of all test explosions of 
nuclear weapons for all time, which are recalled in the preamble to the 1968 Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, 2/

	5.	Calls once more upon all States to support the multilateral negotiations in the Conference on Disarmament for a comprehensive nuclear- test-ban treaty and their conclusion without delay;

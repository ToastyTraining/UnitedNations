	Reaffirming further that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group, 
	Reiterating the important contribution of measures taken at all levels against terrorism, consistent with international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, to the functioning of democratic institutions and the maintenance of peace and security and thereby to the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the need to continue this fight, including by strengthening international cooperation and the role of the United Nations in this respect,
	Reaffirming its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever committed, regardless of their motivation, as criminal and unjustifiable, and renewing its commitment to strengthening international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism, and to deny impunity and pursue accountability in relation to the perpetrators of terrorist acts,
	Deeply deploring the occurrence of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the context of the fight against terrorism, as well as violations of international refugee law and international humanitarian law, 
	Expressing its concern at the increasing use, in a globalized society, by terrorists and their supporters, of information and communications technologies, in particular the Internet and other media, and the use of such technologies to commit, incite, recruit for, fund or plan terrorist acts, noting the importance of cooperation among stakeholders in the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy3 and the comprehensive international framework to counter terrorist narratives,4 including among Member States, international, regional and subregional organizations, the private sector and civil society, to address this issue, while respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms and complying with international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter, and reiterating that such technologies can be powerful tools in countering the spread of terrorism, including by promoting tolerance, dialogue among peoples and peace, 
	Stressing that all measures used in the fight against terrorism, including the profiling of individuals and the use of diplomatic assurances, memorandums of understanding and other transfer agreements or arrangements, must be in compliance with the obligations of States under international law, including international human rights law, international refugee law and international humanitarian law, 
	Stressing also that a criminal justice system based on respect for human rights and the rule of law, including due process and fair trial guarantees, is one of the best means for effectively countering terrorism and ensuring accountability,

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly

[without reference to a Main Committee (A/55/L.19)]
		55/14.	Amendment to rule 1 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 51/241 of 31 July 1997, by which it adopted the recommendations of the Open-ended High-level Working Group on the Strengthening of the United Nations System as contained in the annex to the resolution,
	Recalling in particular paragraph 17 of the annex to resolution 51/241, in which it decided, inter alia, that the plenary meetings of the General Assembly should be formally opened every year on the first Tuesday following 1 September,
	Noting that the Monday immediately preceding the first Tuesday following 1 September falls on a United Nations holiday at Headquarters,
	Mindful that, for practical reasons, the closing of the regular sessions of the General Assembly should be on a Monday, which should not be a holiday, and the opening of the regular sessions should be on the following day, that is to say, on a Tuesday,
	Recalling its resolutions 52/232 of 4 June 1998, 53/224 of 7 April 1999 and 53/239 of 8 June 1999, by which it took ad hoc decisions concerning the opening and/or closing dates of the fifty-second, fifty-third, fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth sessions of the General Assembly,
	Recalling also paragraph 2 of resolution 52/232, in which it decided that the International Day of Peace would continue to be observed on the opening day of the regular sessions,
	1.	Decides to amend rule 1 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly to read: "The General Assembly shall meet every year in regular session commencing on the Tuesday following the second Monday in September";
	2.	Also decides that this amendment shall take effect as from 2001 and that, therefore, for that year, the fifty-fifth session of the General Assembly shall close on Monday, 10 September 2001, and the fifty-sixth session of the Assembly shall open on Tuesday, 11 September 2001.

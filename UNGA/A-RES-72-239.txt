	Welcoming the fact that many countries have made significant progress in developing public policies in favour of family farming, including the formation of national committees for family farming, and making financial inclusion policies for smallholder farmers, such as small-scale credit loans, and recognizing the role that family farms play in improving nutrition and ensuring global food security, eradicating poverty, ending hunger, conserving biodiversity, achieving environmental sustainability and helping to address migration,

	Recognizing also the close links between family farming, the promotion and conservation of historical, cultural and natural heritage, traditional customs and culture, halting the loss of biodiversity and the improvement of the living conditions of people living in rural areas,

	Reaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development", in which it adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for the full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental - in a balanced and integrated manner, and to building upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking to address their unfinished business, 
	Reaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports and complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with concrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to address the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels for sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity, 
	Welcoming the Paris Agreement1 and its early entry into force, encouraging all its parties to fully implement the Agreement, and parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change2 that have not yet done so to deposit their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, where appropriate, as soon as possible,
	Recalling the proclamation of 2016-2025 as the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition,3 based on the Rome Declaration on Nutrition4 and the Framework for Action,5
	Recalling also that nearly 80 per cent of the extreme poor live in rural areas and work in agriculture, and that devoting resources to the development of rural areas and sustainable agriculture and supporting smallholder farmers, especially women farmers, is key to ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions, by, inter alia, improving the welfare of farmers, 
	Recognizing that 815 million people throughout the world still suffer from hunger and that the prevalence of other forms of malnutrition is still considerable in some regions of the world, and stressing the important role of family farms in the production of more than 80 per cent of the world's food in terms of value, 
	Stressing that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system will promote agriculture, family farming and rural development in developing countries and contribute to world food security and nutrition, and urging the adoption of national, regional and international strategies to promote the inclusive participation of farmers, especially small-scale and family farmers, including women, in community, national, regional and international markets, 
	Reaffirming that the realization of gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls will make a crucial contribution to progress across all of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, reaffirming also the critical role and contribution of rural women, including smallholders and women farmers, indigenous women and women in local communities, and their traditional knowledge in enhancing agricultural and rural development, improving food security and eradicating rural poverty, and in this regard stressing the importance of reviewing agricultural policies and strategies to ensure that the critical role of women in food security and nutrition is recognized and addressed as an integral part of both short- and long-term responses to food insecurity, malnutrition, potential excessive price volatility and food crises in developing countries, 
	Stressing the need to achieve full and productive employment and decent work for all women and men, including for young people and persons with disabilities, and acknowledging that policies and programmes that promote innovation on family farms must go hand in hand with policies promoting overall rural development, so as to offer additional or alternative employment and income-generating opportunities in rural areas,

	Conscious that climate change represents an urgent and potentially irreversible threat to human societies and the planet, that it is seriously affecting agriculture throughout the world and that supporting family farming could contribute to combating climate change as well as to increasing the ability to adapt to its adverse impacts and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development in a manner that does not threaten food production,
	Recalling the need to strengthen our efforts to enhance food security and nutrition and to focus on smallholders and women farmers, as well as on agricultural cooperatives and farmers' networks, and the need to encourage countries to revitalize global partnerships,

	Expressing deep concern about the ongoing adverse impacts, particularly on development, of the world financial and economic crisis, recognizing evidence of an uneven and fragile recovery, cognizant that the global economy, notwithstanding significant efforts that helped to contain tail risks, improve financial market conditions and sustain recovery, still remains in a challenging phase, with downside risks, including high volatility in global markets, high unemployment, particularly among youth, indebtedness in some countries and widespread fiscal strains, which pose challenges for global economic recovery and reflect the need for additional progress towards sustaining and rebalancing global demand,
	Recognizing the adverse impact of excessive price volatility of commodities, especially on women and girls,
	Recognizing also that many developing countries continue to be highly dependent on primary commodities as their principal source of export revenues, employment, income generation and domestic savings and as the driving force of investment, economic growth and social development, including poverty eradication,
	Recognizing further, in this context, that many least developed countries, small island developing States, landlocked developing countries and African countries are highly dependent on primary commodities, and recognizing also the challenges and special needs of those countries, many of which are not on track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015,
	Recognizing that uncertainty in global commodity markets reinforces the need to comprehensively deal with the commodity problematique, inter alia, the demand for commodities, supply capacities, commodity revenues and investments in commodity-dependent economies, while taking due account of the diversity of each country's individual situation and needs and the promotion of their sustainable development, and to strengthen the nexus between, inter alia, trade, food, finance, investment in sustainable agriculture, energy and industrialization,

	12.	Stresses that technical assistance and capacity-building aimed at improving the commodity export competitiveness of producers is particularly important, especially in Africa, and invites the donor community to provide the necessary resources for commodity-specific financial and technical assistance, in particular for human and institutional capacity-building, as well as infrastructure development of developing countries, with a view to reducing their institutional bottlenecks and transaction costs and enhancing their commodity trade and development in accordance with national development plans;
	13.

Encourages developed countries that have not already done so and developing countries declaring themselves in a position to do so to take steps towards the goal of realizing timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access on a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration adopted by the World Trade Organization in 2005;

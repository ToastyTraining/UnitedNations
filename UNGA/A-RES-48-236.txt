	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

48/236.Emergency assistance to Uganda


	The General Assembly,

	Deeply concerned about the extensive damage and devastation caused by the major earthquake that recently struck western Uganda,

	Noting with concern the urgent need to address the immediate relief requirements of thousands of residents in the Kabarole, Bundibugyo and Kasese districts,

	Bearing in mind the negative impact of the earthquake on development efforts and on the environment,

	Recognizing the efforts of the Government and people of Uganda to respond to the present crisis,

	Conscious of the financial, organizational and technical constraints that have hampered those efforts,

	Aware of the additional pressure on the infrastructure of Uganda resulting from increased inflows of refugees from neighbouring countries in recent years,

	1.	Declares its solidarity with the Government and people of Uganda in their affliction;

	2.	Notes with satisfaction the national efforts of Uganda to provide assistance to the victims of the earthquake;


	3.	Commends the international community, including the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat, for the measures taken thus far in response to the disaster;


	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to assist the Government and people of Uganda in providing relief and bringing recovery efforts to a successful conclusion;

	5.	Requests all States and international organizations urgently to provide relief assistance to the victims of the disaster and to provide additional support to Uganda to enable the country to shoulder the additional socio-economic and financial burden resulting from the earthquake;

	6.	Also requests the Secretary-General to report to the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1994 on the implementation of the present resolution.

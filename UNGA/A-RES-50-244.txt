	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolutions 43/202, of 20 December 1988, on the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, and 45/199, of 21 December 1990, the annex to which contains the International Development Strategy for the Fourth United Nations Development Decade, and Economic and Social Council resolution 1996/45, of 26 July 1996, on the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction,

	Deeply concerned at the large number of persons killed, missing and affected by hurricane César, which struck Costa Rica and Nicaragua on 26, 27 and 28 July 1996, thereby rendering more difficult the task of consolidating a region of peace, democracy, freedom and development in Central America,

	Also deeply concerned at the tremendous damage caused by hurricane César to the infrastructures and economies of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, which could adversely affect the economic and social development plans of both countries,

	Aware of the efforts of the Governments and peoples of Costa Rica and Nicaragua to save lives and alleviate the suffering of the victims of hurricane César,

	Bearing in mind the enormous effort that will be required to ameliorate the serious situation caused by this natural disaster,

	Recognizing the prompt response of Governments, organs and organizations of the United Nations system, particularly the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat, international and regional agencies and non-governmental organizations in providing relief,


	Also recognizing that the magnitude of the disaster and its medium- and long-term effects will require, as a complement to the efforts already being made by the peoples and Governments of Costa Rica and Nicaragua, a demonstration of international solidarity and humanitarian concern to ensure more broad-based and adequate multilateral cooperation in order to meet the immediate emergency situation in the affected areas and initiate the process of reconstruction,

	1.	Expresses its solidarity and support to the Governments and peoples of Costa Rica and Nicaragua;

	2.	Expresses its gratitude to all the States of the international community, the international agencies and the non-governmental organizations that have provided emergency relief to the affected countries;

	3.	Calls upon all States of the international community as a matter of urgency to contribute generously, to the extent that they are able, to relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction operations in the affected countries;

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General, within existing resources and in cooperation with international financial institutions, and organs and organizations of the United Nations system, to assist the Governments of Costa Rica and Nicaragua in identifying their short-, medium- and long-term needs and also to collaborate in the reconstruction efforts undertaken by the Governments of the affected countries.

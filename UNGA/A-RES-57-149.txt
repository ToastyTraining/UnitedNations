Resolution adopted by the General Assembly
[without reference to a Main Committee (A/57/L.57 and Add.1)]
	57/149.  Emergency humanitarian assistance to Ethiopia


	The General Assembly,
	Noting with concern the recurrent drought that affects Ethiopia, and its consequences,
	Recalling the initiative of the Secretary-General of 13 September 2000 to improve food security in the Horn of Africa over the long term,
	Gravely concerned at the magnitude of the current drought, which may affect up to fifteen million people owing to the serious crop failures in drought-prone parts of the country that have weak infrastructures and low development capacities,
	Bearing in mind the 2003 appeal for emergency assistance for Ethiopia, launched on 6 December 2002 by the United Nations and the Government of Ethiopia, to respond to the looming famine situation and to prevent the imminent humanitarian crisis,
	Noting with serious concern the dire humanitarian situation and its long-term socio-economic and environmental impact,
	Emphasizing the need to address the crisis bearing in mind the importance of the transition from relief to development, and acknowledging the underlying structural causes for the recurrent famine in Ethiopia,
	Recognizing that the main responsibility for improving the humanitarian situation and creating conditions for long-term development lies with the Government of Ethiopia, while bearing in mind the important role played by the international community,
	1.	Calls upon the international community to urgently and effectively respond to the unfolding and imminent humanitarian crisis, which may affect up to fifteen million people in the country, consisting of crop producers and pastoralists;
	2.	Welcomes the efforts of the Government of Ethiopia, the international community and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, to strengthen mechanisms already in place to respond to such emergency situations;
	3.	Also welcomes the initiative of the Secretary-General to tackle the recurrent drought in the country on a long-term basis, and in this regard calls for its serious consideration by the relevant organizations;
	4.	Calls upon the international community to respond as a matter of urgency to the crisis, based on the requirements of the 2003 appeal for emergency assistance for Ethiopia covering food and non-food needs, as well as to the urgent needs of programme interventions in early 2003, addressing issues of recovery, asset protection and the sustainable development of the chronically affected areas;
	5.	Welcomes the efforts of the Government of Ethiopia to increase the availability of food through domestic production, to ensure access to food for households in need and to strengthen emergency response capabilities;
	6.	Invites the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat to continue considering ways to enhance the mobilization of emergency relief assistance for Ethiopia;
	7.	Calls upon all development partners to stress the need to integrate relief efforts with recovery, asset protection and long-term development and to address the underlying structural causes for the recurrent famine in Ethiopia, inter alia, in line with the poverty reduction strategy paper, including strategies aimed at preventing such crises in the future and that improve the resilience of the population;
	8.	Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session on the implementation of the present resolution.

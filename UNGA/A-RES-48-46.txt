	Reaffirming also that any economic or other activity that constitutes an obstacle to the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and obstructs efforts aimed at the elimination of colonialism, apartheid and racial discrimination is a direct violation of the rights of the inhabitants and of the principles of the Charter and all relevant resolutions of the United Nations,

	Reaffirming further that the natural resources are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories, 

	Concerned about the activities of those foreign economic, financial and other interests that exploit the natural and human resources of the Non-Self-Governing Territories to the detriment of the interests of the inhabitants of those Territories and deprive them of their right to control the wealth of their countries,

	Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the final documents of the successive Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries and of the resolutions adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, the South Pacific Forum and the Caribbean Community,

	3.	Reaffirms its concern over the activities of those foreign economic, financial and other interests which continue to exploit the natural resources that are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial

	5.	Calls once again upon all Governments that have not yet done so to take, in accordance with the relevant provisions of General Assembly resolution 2621 (XXV) of 12 October 1970, legislative, administrative or other measures in respect of their nationals and the bodies corporate under their jurisdiction that own and operate enterprises in colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories that are detrimental to the interests of the inhabitants of those Territories, in order to put an end to such enterprises and to prevent new investments that run counter to the interests of the inhabitants of those Territories;

	6.

	9.	Calls upon the administering Powers concerned to ensure that no discriminatory and unjust wage systems or working conditions prevail in the Territories under their administration and to apply in each Territory a uniform system of wages to all the inhabitants without any discrimination;

	10.		Requests the Secretary-General to continue, through all means at his disposal, to inform world public opinion of those activities of foreign economic and other interests which impede the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples;

	13.		Requests the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples to continue to examine this question and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session.

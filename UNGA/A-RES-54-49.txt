54/49.Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 53/70 of 4 December 1998,

	Recalling also its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security, in which, inter alia, it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged,

	Noting that considerable progress has been achieved in developing and applying the latest information technologies and means of telecommunication,

	Affirming that it sees in this process the broadest positive opportunities for the further development of civilization, the expansion of opportunities for cooperation for the common good of all States, the enhancement of the creative potential of mankind and additional improvements in the circulation of information in the global community,

	Recalling in this connection the approaches and principles outlined at the Information Society and Development Conference, held at Midrand, South Africa, from 13 to 15 May 1996,


	Taking note of the results of the Ministerial Conference on Terrorism, held in Paris on 30 July 1996, and of the recommendations it made,1

	Noting that the dissemination and use of information technologies and means affect the interests of the entire international community and that optimum effectiveness is enhanced by broad international cooperation,

	Expressing concern that these technologies and means can potentially be used for purposes that are inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security and may adversely affect the security of States in both civilian and military fields,

	Considering that it is necessary to prevent the misuse or exploitation of information resources or technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes,

	Noting the contribution of those Member States that have submitted their assessments on issues of information security to the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraphs 1 to 3 of resolution 53/70,

	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General containing those assessments,2

	Welcoming the timely initiative taken by the Secretariat and the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research in convening an international meeting of experts at Geneva in August 1999 on developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security,

	Considering that the assessments of Member States contained in the report of the Secretary-General and the international meeting of experts have contributed to a better understanding of the substance of issues of international information security, related notions and possible measures to limit the threats emerging in this field,

	1.	Calls upon Member States to promote further at multilateral levels the consideration of existing and potential threats in the field of information security;

	2.	Invites all Member States to continue to inform the Secretary-General of their views and assessments on the following questions:

	(a)	General appreciation of the issues of information security;

	(b)	Definition of basic notions related to information security, including unauthorized interference with or misuse of information and telecommunications systems and information resources;

	(c)	Advisability of developing international principles that would enhance the security of global information and telecommunications systems and help to combat information terrorism and criminality;


	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session;

	The General Assembly,
	Bearing in mind the role and authority of the General Assembly as a principal organ of the United Nations and the importance of its effectiveness and efficiency in fulfilling its functions under the Charter of the United Nations,
	Recognizing that the current interdependent international environment requires the strengthening of the multilateral system in accordance with the purposes and principles of the United Nations and the principles of international law,
	Recognizing also the importance of cooperation between the United Nations and regional organizations, as well as the benefits to the United Nations of such cooperation,
	Acknowledging that it is for each regional organization to define the modalities of its external representation,
	Recalling its resolution 3208 (XXIX) of 11 October 1974, by which it granted observer status to the European Economic Community,
	Recalling also that, consistent with the relevant legal provisions, the European Union has replaced the European Community and is a party to many instruments concluded under the auspices of the United Nations and an observer or participant in the work of several specialized agencies and bodies of the United Nations,
	Noting that the States members of the European Union have entrusted the external representation of the European Union, previously performed by the representatives of the member State holding the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union, to the following institutional representatives: the President of the European Council, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, the European Commission, and European Union delegations, which have assumed the role of acting on behalf of the European Union in the exercise of the competences conferred by its member States,
	Mindful of the modalities for the participation of observer States and entities, and other observers in the work of the United Nations, as set out in the respective resolutions,
	1.	Reaffirms that the General Assembly is an intergovernmental body whose membership is limited to States that are Members of the United Nations;
	2.	Decides to adopt the modalities set out in the annex to the present resolution for the participation of the representatives of the European Union, in its capacity as observer, in the sessions and work of the General Assembly and its committees and working groups, in international meetings and conferences convened under the auspices of the Assembly and in United Nations conferences;
	3.	Recognizes that, following a request on behalf of a regional organization that has observer status in the General Assembly and whose member States have agreed arrangements that allow that organization's representatives to speak on behalf of the organization and its member States, the Assembly may adopt modalities for the participation of that regional organization's representatives, such as those set out in the annex to the present resolution;
	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to inform the General Assembly during its sixty-fifth session on the implementation of the modalities set out in the annex to the present resolution.

Invites Governments and international organizations, in partnership with cooperatives and cooperative organizations, to strengthen and build the capacity of all forms of cooperatives, especially those run by the poor, young people, women, persons with disabilities and other vulnerable groups, so that they can empower people to transform their lives and communities positively and build inclusive societies;

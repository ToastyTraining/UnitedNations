	Reaffirming Article 17 of the Charter of the United Nations and rule 160 of its rules of procedure,
	Recalling paragraphs 5 and 6 of its resolution 58/1 B,
	Having considered the reports of the Committee on Contributions on its sixty-seventh,1 sixty-eighth2 and sixty-ninth3 sessions as well as the reports of the Secretary-General on multi-year payment plans,4
	1.	Reaffirms that the determination of the scale of assessments for the apportionment of expenses of the United Nations shall remain the prerogative of the General Assembly;

	(a)	Estimates of gross national income;
	(b)	Average statistical base periods of three and six years;
	(c)	Conversion rates based on market exchange rates, except where that would cause excessive fluctuations and distortions in the income of some Member States, when price-adjusted rates of exchange or other appropriate conversion rates should be employed, taking due account of its resolution 46/221 B of 20 December 1991;
	(d)	The debt-burden approach employed in the scale of assessments for the period 2007-2009;
	(e)	A low per capita income adjustment of 80 per cent, with a threshold per capita income limit of the average per capita gross national income of all Member States for the statistical base periods;

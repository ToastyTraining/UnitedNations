	Commending the World Health Organization for its role in implementing the mandate conferred upon it by the General Assembly to work in close cooperation with the United Nations regional commissions to coordinate road safety issues within the United Nations system, and commending also the progress of the United Nations Road Safety Collaboration as a consultative mechanism whose members provide Governments and civil society with good practice guidelines to support action to tackle the major road safety risk factors and support their implementation,
	Recognizing the work of the United Nations regional commissions and their subsidiary bodies in increasing their road safety activities and advocating increased political commitment to road safety, and in this context welcoming the conclusions and recommendations of the project "Improving global road safety: setting regional and national road traffic casualty reduction targets", implemented by the United Nations regional commissions to assist low- and middle-income countries in setting and achieving road traffic casualty reduction targets,

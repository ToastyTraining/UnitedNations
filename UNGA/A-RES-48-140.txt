	Noting that certain advances, notably in the biomedical and life sciences as well as in information technology, may have potentially adverse consequences for the integrity, dignity and human rights of the individual, and that illicit dumping of toxic and dangerous substances and waste  potentially constitutes a serious threat to the human rights, the life and health of everyone,


	Considering that the human being is in the centre of social and economic development,

	Conscious that modern science and technology give the possibility to create material conditions for the prosperity of society and for the thorough development of the human person,

	Recognizing the need for international cooperation so that all mankind can benefit from the achievements of scientific and technological progress and so that their use in favour of economic and social progress can  be to the benefit of all, 

	Convinced of the need to develop life science ethics both nationally and internationally,

	1.	Calls upon all Member States to ensure that the achievements of scientific and technological progress and the intellectual potential of mankind are used for promoting and encouraging universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms;

	4.	Requests the specialized agencies and other United Nations bodies to inform the Secretary-General of the activities and programmes carried out to ensure development of life and technical sciences respectful of human rights, in order to contribute to the reports of the Secretary-General requested in resolution 1993/91 and decision 1993/113 of the Commission on Human Rights;

    Recalling Security Council resolutions 727 (1992) of 8 January 1992 and 740 (1992) of 7 February 1992, in which the Council endorsed the sending of a group of military liaison officers to Yugoslavia to promote maintenance of the ceasefire,

    Recalling also Security Council resolution 743 (1992) of 21 February 1992, by which the Council established the United Nations Protection Force, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended and expanded its mandate,

    Recalling further Security Council resolution 1031 (1995) of 15 December 1995, in which the Council decided to terminate the mandate of the United Nations Protection Force on the date on which the Secretary-General reported that the transfer of authority from the United Nations Protection Force to the Implementation Force had taken place,

    Reaffirming that the costs of the combined Forces are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

    Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the combined Forces, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the combined Forces by certain Governments,

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the combined Forces with the necessary financial resources to enable them to meet their outstanding liabilities,


    1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the combined Forces as at 30 April 2000, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 622.7 million United States dollars, representing 13 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the United Nations Protection Force to the period ending 30 June 1997, notes that some 49 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

    2.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

    3.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursements to troop contributors that bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

    4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the combined Forces in full;

    5.	Expresses concern at the delay experienced by the Secretary-General in deploying and providing adequate resources to some recent peacekeeping missions, in particular those in Africa;

    6.	Emphasizes that all future and existing peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements;

    7.	Also emphasizes that all peacekeeping missions shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates;

    8.	Endorses the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2 and requests the Secretary-General to ensure their full implementation;

    9.	Authorizes the Secretary-General to retain an amount of 1,193,000 dollars gross (963,300 dollars net) from the amount of 1,199,200 dollars gross (1,070,300 dollars net) concurred in by the Advisory Committee from the unencumbered balance of 3,467,200 dollars gross (4,094,200 dollars net) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 to meet the cost of completing the liquidation of the mission;

    10.	Also authorizes the Secretary-General to retain an amount of 179,899,700 dollars gross and net from the balance of appropriations of 304,179,027 dollars gross (304,955,370 dollars net) to meet the cost of outstanding Government claims;

    11.	Requests the Secretary-General to present a more detailed explanation of the amounts required for reimbursement of contingent-owned equipment, including the impact of the retroactive application of the new procedures for contingent-owned equipment, in the context of the final report on the combined Forces, and to reconsider the question at its fifty-fifth session;

    12.	Decides to keep under review the amounts budgeted for reimbursement of contingent-owned equipment;

    13.	Decides also to suspend for the immediate future the provisions of regulations 4.3, 4.4 and 5.2 (d) of the financial regulations of the United Nations in respect of the remaining surplus of 124,279,327 dollars gross (125,055,670 dollars net) in order to allow for reimbursements to troop contributors and in the light of the cash shortage of the combined Forces, and requests the Secretary-General to provide an updated report in one year;


    14.	Emphasizes that no peacekeeping mission shall be financed by borrowing funds from other active peacekeeping missions;

    15.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-fifth session the item entitled "Financing of the United Nations Protection Force, the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation in Croatia, the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force and the United Nations Peace Forces headquarters".

60/199.	Promotion of new and renewable sources of energy, including the implementation of the World Solar Programme


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 53/7 of 16 October 1998, 54/215 of 22 December 1999, 55/205 of 20 December 2000, 56/200 of 21 December 2001 and 58/210 of 23 December 2003 on the promotion of new and renewable sources of energy, including the implementation of the World Solar Programme 1996-2005,
	Recalling also the 2005 World Summit Outcome,1
	Noting that the World Solar Programme 1996-2005 made a contribution to raising awareness of the increased role that new and renewable sources of energy can play in the global energy supply,
	Recalling the recommendations and conclusions contained in the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development ("Johannesburg Plan of Implementation")2 concerning energy for sustainable development,
	Welcoming initiatives that aim to improve access to reliable, affordable, economically viable, socially acceptable and environmentally sound energy services for sustainable development in order to contribute to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including those set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,3
	Emphasizing that the increased use and promotion of all forms of new and renewable energy for sustainable development, including solar-thermal, photovoltaic, biomass, wind, hydro, tidal, ocean and geothermal forms, could make a significant contribution towards the achievement of sustainable development and the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals,
	Welcoming efforts by Governments and institutions that have embarked on policies and programmes that seek to expand the use of new and renewable energy for sustainable development, and recognizing the contributions of regional initiatives as well as of institutions in supporting the efforts of countries, in particular developing countries, in this respect, 
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;4
	2.	Reaffirms that the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation2 is the intergovernmental framework for energy for sustainable development agreed to at the World Summit on Sustainable Development, and calls for its full implementation;
	3.	Emphasizes the need to intensify research and development in support of energy for sustainable development, which will require increased commitment on the part of all stakeholders, including Governments and the private sector, to deploy financial and human resources for accelerating research efforts;
	4.	Calls upon Governments, as well as relevant regional and international organizations and other relevant stakeholders, to combine, as appropriate, the increased use of renewable energy resources, more efficient use of energy, greater reliance on advanced energy technologies, including advanced and cleaner fossil fuel technologies, and the sustainable use of traditional energy resources, which could meet the growing need for energy services in the longer term to achieve sustainable development;
	5.	Encourages national and regional initiatives on new and renewable energies to promote access to energy, including new and renewable sources of energy, for the poorest and to improve energy efficiency and conservation by resorting to a mix of available technologies, taking into full account the provisions of the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation concerning energy for sustainable development;
	6.	Calls upon Governments to take further action to mobilize the provision of financial resources, technology transfer, capacity-building and the diffusion of environmentally sound technologies, as set out in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation;
	7.	Welcomes the holding of the Beijing International Renewable Energy Conference 2005, organized by the Government of the People's Republic of China and supported by the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany, on 7 and 8 November 2005, in follow-up to the International Conference for Renewable Energies held in Bonn from 1 to 4 June 2004;
	8.	Takes note of ongoing activities related to the promotion of new and renewable sources of energy within the United Nations system;
	9.	Encourages the United Nations system to continue to raise awareness of the importance of energy for sustainable development, including the need for the promotion of new and renewable sources of energy and of the increased role they can play in the global energy supply, particularly in the context of sustainable development and poverty eradication;
	10.	Requests the Secretary-General, in his report on energy to the Commission on Sustainable Development at its fourteenth session, to present an overview of the implementation of the World Solar Programme 1996-2005;
	11.	Stresses that the wider use of available renewable sources of energy requires technology transfer and diffusion on a global scale, including through North-South and South-South cooperation;
	12.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-second session a report on the implementation of the present resolution;
	13.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-second session, under the item entitled "Sustainable development", a sub-item entitled "Promotion of new and renewable sources of energy".

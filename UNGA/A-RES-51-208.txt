	Recalling the right of third States confronted with special economic problems of that nature to consult the Security Council with regard to a solution of those problems, in accordance with Article 50 of the Charter,

	Recognizing the desirability of the consideration of further appropriate procedures for consultations to deal in a more effective manner with the problems referred to in Article 50 of the Charter,

	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General submitted in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/51 of 11 December 1995,11

	Recalling that the question of assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions has been addressed recently in several forums, including the General Assembly and its subsidiary organs and the Security Council,

	Recalling also the measures taken by the Security Council in accordance with the statement by the President of the Security Council of 16 December 199412 that as part of the Council's effort to improve the flow of information and the exchange of ideas between members of the Council and other States Members of the United Nations, there should be increased recourse to open meetings, in particular at an early stage in its consideration of a subject,

	Stressing that in the formulation of sanctions regimes, due account should be taken of the potential effects of sanctions on third States,

	Stressing also, in this context, the powers of the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter and the Council's primary responsibility under Article 24 of the Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security in order to ensure prompt and effective action by the United Nations,

	Recalling that, under Article 31 of the Charter, any Member of the United Nations which is not a member of the Security Council may participate, without vote, in the discussion of any question brought before the Security Council whenever the latter considers that the interests of that Member are specially affected,

	Recognizing that the imposition of sanctions under Chapter VII has been causing special economic problems in third States,

	Recognizing also that assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions would further contribute to an effective and comprehensive approach by the international community to sanctions imposed by the Security Council,

	Recognizing further that the international community at large and, in particular, international institutions involved in providing economic and financial assistance should continue to take into account and address in a more effective manner the special economic problems of affected third States arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures taken by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter, in view of their magnitude and of the adverse impact on the economy of those States,

	Recalling the provisions of resolution 50/51,

	1.	Underlines the importance of consultations under Article 50 of the Charter of the United Nations, as early as possible, with third States which are or may be confronted with special economic problems arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures imposed by the Security Council under Chapter VII of the Charter and of early and regular assessments, as appropriate, of their impact on such States;

	2.	Invites the Security Council to consider the establishment of further mechanisms or procedures, as appropriate, for such consultations with regard to a solution of those problems, including appropriate ways and means for increasing the effectiveness of its working methods and procedures applied in the consideration of the requests by the affected countries for assistance, in the context of Article 50 of the Charter;

	3.	Welcomes the further measures taken by the Security Council since the adoption of General Assembly resolution 50/51 and aimed at increasing the effectiveness and transparency of the sanctions committees, and strongly recommends that the Council continue its efforts further to enhance the functioning of those committees, to streamline their working procedures and to facilitate access to them by representatives of States which find themselves confronted with special economic problems arising from the carrying out of sanctions;

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the competent units within the Secretariat that he designated to carry out the functions stipulated in paragraph 3 of resolution 50/51 develop the capacity and modalities for providing better information and early assessments for the Security Council and its organs, at their request, about actual or potential effects of sanctions on third States which invoke Article 50 of the Charter; such assessments should, as appropriate, identify specific problems and needs of those States and suggest specific ways and means for their alleviation to be included in the recommendations of the Council and appeals by the Secretary-General to the donor community for assistance to the adversely affected States;

	5.	Also requests the Secretary-General to continue, on the basis of the work already done, efforts with a view to developing a possible methodology for assessing the adverse consequences actually incurred by third States as a result of preventive or enforcement measures, and to utilize for this purpose all the expertise available throughout the United Nations system, including that of the international financial and trade institutions; that methodology, upon appropriate approval, should be made available to interested States which may wish to use it in preparing the data to be annexed to their applications under Article 50, as well as to the United Nations system, the international financial institutions and the donor community for use in considering requests for assistance;

	6.	Further requests the Secretary-General to continue, on a regular basis, to collate and coordinate information about international assistance available to third States affected by the implementation of sanctions and to initiate action to explore innovative and practical measures of assistance to the affected third States, inter alia, through cooperation with relevant institutions and organizations inside and outside the United Nations system;

	7.	Reaffirms the important role of the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and the Committee for Programme and Coordination in mobilizing and monitoring, as appropriate, the economic assistance efforts by the international community and the United Nations system to States confronted with special economic problems arising from the carrying out of preventive or enforcement measures imposed by the Security Council and, as appropriate, in identifying solutions to the special economic problems of those States;

	8.	Invites the organizations of the United Nations system, international financial institutions, other international organizations, regional organizations and Member States to continue to address more specifically and directly, where appropriate, special economic problems of third States affected by sanctions imposed under Chapter VII of the Charter and, for this purpose, to consider improving procedures for consultations to maintain a constructive dialogue with such States, including through regular and frequent meetings as well as, where appropriate, special meetings between the affected third States and the donor community, with the participation of United Nations agencies and other international organizations;


	9.	Requests the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization, at its session in 1997, to continue to consider on a priority basis the question of the implementation of the provisions of the Charter related to assistance to third States affected by the application of sanctions under Chapter VII of the Charter, taking into consideration all the related reports of the Secretary-General, the proposals submitted on this subject, the debate on this question which took place in the Sixth Committee at the fifty-first session of the General Assembly and the debate in the sub-group on sanctions of the Open-ended Working Group on an Agenda for Peace during the fiftieth session of the General Assembly, and also the implementation of the provisions of the present resolution;

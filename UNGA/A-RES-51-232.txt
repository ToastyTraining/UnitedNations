	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/51/724/Add.1)]


51/232.Financing of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force,1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2 and taking note of the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services,3

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 350 (1974) of 31 May 1974, by which the Council established the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force, the latest of which was resolution 1081 (1996) of
27 November 1996,

	Recalling its resolution 3211 B (XXIX) of 29 November 1974 on the financing of the United Nations Emergency Force and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force and its subsequent resolutions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 50/20 B of 7 June 1996,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,


	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	Concerned that the Secretary-General continues to face difficulties in meeting the obligations of the Force on a current basis, including reimbursement to current and former troop-contributing States,

	Concerned also that the surplus balances in the Special Account for the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force have been used to meet expenses of the Force in order to compensate for the lack of income resulting from non-payment and late payment by Member States of their contributions,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force as at 15 May 1997, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 47.9 million United States dollars, representing 4.2 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Force to the period ending 31 May 1997, notes that some 24 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

	4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure the payment of their assessed contributions to the Force in full and on time;

Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force the amount of 33,616,400 dollars gross (32,714,400 dollars net) for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998, inclusive of the amount of 1,248,400 dollars for the support account for peacekeeping operations, to be assessed on Member States at the monthly rate of 2,801,366 dollars gross (2,726,200 dollars net), in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996 and 51/218 A and B of 18 December 1996 and its decisions

48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and 50/451 B of 23 December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the year 1997, as set out in its resolution 49/19 B of 23 December 1994 and its decision 50/471 A
of 23 December 1995, and for the year 1998,4 subject to the decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the Force beyond 31 May 1997;

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Second Committee (A/49/728/Add.1)]


49/102.Transit environment in the land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours

	The General Assembly, 

	Recalling its resolutions 48/169 and 48/170 of 21 December 1993,

	Recalling further the agreed conclusions and recommendations of the Meeting of Governmental Experts from Land-locked and Transit Developing Countries and Representatives of Donor Countries and Financial and Development Institutions, convened by the Trade and Development Board in New York from 17 to 19 May 1993, 1/ and in particular, the conclusions and recommendations of the above Meeting pertaining to the newly independent and developing land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours,

	Recognizing that the overall socio-economic development efforts of these countries, seeking to enter world markets through the establishment of a multicountry transit system, are impeded by a lack of territorial access to the sea as well as by remoteness and isolation from world markets,

	Supporting the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours through relevant multilateral, bilateral and regional arrangements to address the issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region,

	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General entitled "Transit transport systems of the newly independent and developing land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours:  current situation and proposals for future action", 2/


	Noting that the report, as stated in paragraph 1 of its introduction, represents a first approximation only towards a fuller elaboration of more concrete programmes of action for dealing with the issues,

	Recognizing that to be effective, a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inhering in the use of existing transit routes and the early development and smooth functioning of new, alternative routes,

	Emphasizing the importance of strengthening international support measures to address further the problems of newly independent and developing land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours,

	1.	Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in consultation with the Governments concerned and in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources, to elaborate a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours and to make a comprehensive analysis and study of the transit system for Central Asian countries, paying particular attention to the development of all new, appropriate and feasible alternative transit routes and corridors, including the shortest ones;

	2.	Invites donor countries and multilateral financial and development institutions, within their mandates, to provide newly independent and developing land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours with appropriate financial and technical assistance for the improvement of the transit environment for these countries;

	3.	Requests the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in collaboration with the relevant international and regional organizations referred to in the present resolution, to study the possibility of holding, within existing financial resources, a regional symposium for the newly independent and developing land-locked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours, with the participation of other interested States, on transport and transit issues in the region, upon completion of the comprehensive analysis and study requested in paragraph 1 above and before this issue is taken up by the General Assembly at its fifty-first session;

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to prepare a report on the implementation of the present resolution, to be submitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session.

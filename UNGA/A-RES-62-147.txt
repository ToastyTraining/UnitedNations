	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 60/149 of 16 December 2005 and Commission on Human Rights resolution 2004/69 of 21 April 2004,1 
	Mindful that the International Covenants on Human Rights2 constitute the first all-embracing and legally binding international treaties in the field of human rights and, together with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,3 form the core of the International Bill of Human Rights,
	Recalling the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights2 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,2 and reaffirming that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, that they should be treated in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis, and that the promotion and protection of one category of rights should never exempt or excuse States from the promotion and protection of the other rights,
	Recognizing the important role of the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in examining the progress made by States parties in fulfilling the obligations undertaken in the International Covenants on Human Rights and the Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights4 and in providing recommendations to States parties on their implementation,
	Considering that the effective functioning of the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights is indispensable for the full and effective implementation of the International Covenants on Human Rights,
	Noting the ongoing deliberations on the proposal to rectify the legal status of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,
	Recognizing the importance of regional human rights instruments and monitoring mechanisms in complementing the universal system of promotion and protection of human rights,
	1.	Reaffirms the importance of the International Covenants on Human Rights2 as major components of international efforts to promote universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms;
	2.	Strongly appeals to all States that have not yet done so to become parties to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights2 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,2 and to consider as a matter of priority acceding to the Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights4 and making the declaration provided for in article 41 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and, while acknowledging that additional States have recently become parties to these instruments, requests the Secretary-General to continue to support the annual treaty event to this end;
	3.	Invites the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to intensify systematic efforts to encourage States to become parties to the International Covenants on Human Rights and, through the programme of advisory services in the field of human rights, to assist such States, at their request, in ratifying or acceding to the Covenants and to the Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights with a view to achieving universal adherence;

	6.	Stresses the importance of avoiding the erosion of human rights by derogation, and recalls that certain rights are recognized as non-derogable in any circumstances, underlines the exceptional and temporary nature of any such derogations, and that they must be in accordance with the conditions and procedures stipulated under article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, bearing in mind the need for States parties to provide the fullest possible information during states of emergency so that the justification for the appropriateness of measures taken in those circumstances can be assessed, and in this regard takes note of General Comment No. 29 adopted by the Human Rights Committee;6
	7.	Encourages States parties to consider limiting the extent of any reservations that they lodge to the International Covenants on Human Rights and the Optional Protocols to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to formulate any reservations as precisely and narrowly as possible and to regularly review such reservations with a view to withdrawing them so as to ensure that no reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the relevant treaty;

	12.	Strongly encourages States parties that have not yet submitted core documents to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to do so, invites them to make use of the harmonized guidelines on reporting, and also invites all States parties regularly to review and update their core documents while bearing in mind the current discussion on the elaboration of an expanded core document;

	16.	Reiterates that States parties should take into account, in their nomination of members to the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, that the Committees shall be composed of persons of high moral character and recognized competence in the field of human rights, consideration being given to the usefulness of the participation of some persons having legal experience, and to equal representation of women and men, and that members serve in their personal capacity, and also reiterates that, in the elections of the Committees, consideration shall be given to equitable geographical distribution of membership and to the representation of the different forms of civilization and of the principal legal systems; 
	17.	Invites the Human Rights Committee and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, when considering the reports of States parties, to continue to identify specific needs that might be addressed by United Nations departments, funds and programmes and the specialized agencies, including through the programme of advisory services and technical cooperation of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights;

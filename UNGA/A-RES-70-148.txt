70/148.	Protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism


	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,
	Reaffirming also the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1
	Reaffirming further the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,2
	Reaffirming the fundamental importance, including in response to terrorism and the fear of terrorism, of respecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law,
	Reaffirming also that States are under the obligation to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms of all persons,
	Reaffirming further that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group,
	Reiterating the important contribution of measures taken at all levels against terrorism, consistent with international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, to the functioning of democratic institutions and the maintenance of peace and security and thereby to the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the need to continue this fight, including by strengthening international cooperation and the role of the United Nations in this respect,
	Reaffirming its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever committed, regardless of their motivation, as criminal and unjustifiable, and renewing its commitment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism,
	Deeply deploring the occurrence of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the context of the fight against terrorism, as well as violations of international refugee and humanitarian law,
	Noting with concern measures that can undermine human rights and the rule of law, such as the detention of persons suspected of acts of terrorism in the absence of a legal basis for detention and due process guarantees, the deprivation of liberty that amounts to placing a detained person outside the protection of the law, the trial of suspects without fundamental judicial guarantees, the illegal deprivation of liberty and transfer of individuals suspected of terrorist activities, the return of suspects to countries without individual assessment of the risk of there being substantial grounds for believing that they would be in danger of subjection to torture and limitations to effective scrutiny of counter-terrorism measures,
	Expressing its concern at the increasing use, in a globalized society, by terrorists and their supporters, of information and communications technologies, in particular the Internet and other media, and the use of such technologies to commit, incite, recruit for, fund or plan terrorist acts, noting the importance of cooperation among stakeholders in the implementation of the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,3 including among Member States, international, regional and subregional organizations, the private sector and civil society, to address this issue, while respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms and complying with international law and the purposes and principles of the Charter, and reiterating that such technologies can be powerful tools in countering the spread of terrorism, including by promoting tolerance, dialogue among peoples and peace,
	Stressing that all measures used in the fight against terrorism, including the profiling of individuals and the use of diplomatic assurances, memorandums of understanding and other transfer agreements or arrangements, must be in compliance with the obligations of States under international law, including international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law,
	Stressing also that a criminal justice system based on respect for human rights and the rule of law, including due process and fair trial guarantees, is one of the best means for effectively countering terrorism and ensuring accountability,
	Recalling article 30 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and reaffirming that acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations are activities aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy, threatening the territorial integrity and security of States and destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments, and that the international community should take the steps necessary to enhance cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism,4
	Alarmed by the increasing number of terrorist acts targeting ethnic, religious and cultural groups, and seriously concerned at all attacks upon religious places, sites and shrines, including any deliberate destruction of relics and monuments,
	Recognizing that respect for all human rights, respect for democracy and respect for the rule of law are interrelated and mutually reinforcing,
	Emphasizing the importance of properly interpreting and implementing the obligations of States with respect to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and of abiding strictly by the definition of torture contained in article 1 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment5 in the fight against terrorism,
	Recalling its resolution 68/178 of 18 December 2013, Human Rights Council resolutions 25/7 of 27 March 20146 and 29/9 of 2 July 2015,7 as well as other relevant resolutions and decisions, as stated in the preamble to General Assembly resolution 65/221 of 21 December 2010, and welcoming the efforts of all relevant stakeholders to implement those resolutions,
	Recalling also its resolution 60/288 of 8 September 2006, by which it adopted the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, and its resolution 68/276 of 13 June 2014 on the review of the Strategy, reaffirming that the promotion and protection of human rights for all and the rule of law are essential to the fight against terrorism, recognizing that effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not conflicting goals but are complementary and mutually reinforcing, and stressing the need to promote and protect the rights of victims of terrorism,
	Recalling further Human Rights Council resolution 22/8 of 21 March 2013,8 by which the Council decided to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism,
	Recalling its resolution 64/115 of 16 December 2009 and the annex thereto, entitled "Introduction and implementation of sanctions imposed by the United Nations", in particular the provisions of the annex regarding listing and delisting procedures,

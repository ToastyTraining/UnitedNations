	Recalling also its resolution 64/167 of 18 December 2009, as well as relevant resolutions adopted by the Human Rights Council, including resolution 14/10 of 18 June 2010,1 in which the Council took note of the report of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances2 and the recommendations contained therein,
	Deeply concerned, in particular, by the increase in enforced or involuntary disappearances in various regions of the world, including arrest, detention and abduction, when these are part of or amount to enforced disappearances, and by the growing number of reports concerning harassment, ill-treatment and intimidation of witnesses of disappearances or relatives of persons who have disappeared,

	Recognizing that the entry into force of the Convention and its implementation will be a significant contribution to ending impunity and promoting and protecting all human rights for all,
	Welcoming the fact that, in recent years, 30 August has been observed in many countries around the world as the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances,
	1.	Welcomes the adoption of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance;3
	2.	Also welcomes the fact that eighty-seven States have signed the Convention and twenty-one have ratified or acceded to it, enabling it to enter into force on 23 December 2010, and calls upon States that have not yet done so to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Convention as a matter of priority, as well as to consider the option provided for in articles 31 and 32 of the Convention regarding the Committee on Enforced Disappearances;
	3.	Further welcomes the report of the Secretary-General;4
	4.	Decides to declare 30 August the International Day of the Victims of Enforced Disappearances, to be observed beginning in 2011, and calls upon Member States, the United Nations system and other international and regional organizations, as well as civil society, to observe this Day;

	6.	Requests United Nations agencies and organizations, and invites intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations and the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances, to continue making efforts to disseminate information on the Convention, to promote understanding of it, to prepare for its entry into force and to assist States parties in implementing their obligations under this instrument;

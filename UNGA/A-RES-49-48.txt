	3.	Appeals to all States parties to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 that have not yet done so to consider becoming parties to the additional Protocols at the earliest possible date;

	4.	Calls upon all States which are already parties to Protocol I, or those States not parties, on becoming parties to Protocol I, to make the declaration provided for under article 90 of that Protocol;

	5.	Takes note of the declaration adopted at the International Conference for the Protection of War Victims, held at Geneva from 30 August to 1 September 1993, 4/ reaffirming the necessity of preventive measures and of making the implementation of international humanitarian law more effective;

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session a report on the status of the additional Protocols based on information received from Member States;

	7.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-first session the item entitled "Status of the Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and relating to the protection of victims of armed conflicts".

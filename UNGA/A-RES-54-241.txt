54/241.	Financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone and financing of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone

    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone and the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone1 and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

    Bearing in mind Security Council resolutions 1181 (1998) of 13 July 1998, by which the Council established the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone, 1260 (1999) of 20 August 1999, by which the Council authorized the provisional expansion of the Observer Mission, and 1270 (1999) of 22 October 1999, by which the Council established the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone for an initial period of six months,

    Recalling its resolution 53/29 of 20 November 1998 on the financing of the Observer Mission,  


    Reaffirming that the costs of the Observer Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations, and recognizing that the costs of the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone are also to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter,

    Recalling its previous decision concerning the Observer Mission, and recognizing that, with regard to the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Observer Mission and the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone,

Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone as at 30 November 1999, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 1.2 million United States dollars, representing 8 per cent of the total assessed contributions, notes that some 37 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

    2.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

    10.	Notes that a technical assessment mission will be undertaken to assess the needs relating to mine clearance, and requests that the necessary funding for operational demining needs be made available for these activities;

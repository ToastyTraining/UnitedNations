64/72.	Sustainable fisheries, including through the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions
 		of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
		of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, and related instruments


	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming its annual resolutions on sustainable fisheries, including resolution 63/112 of 5 December 2008, and other relevant resolutions,
	Recalling the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ("the Convention"),1 and bearing in mind the relationship between the Convention and the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks ("the Agreement"),2
	Welcoming the recent ratifications of and accessions to the Agreement and the fact that a growing number of States, and entities referred to in the Convention and in article 1, paragraph 2 (b), of the Agreement, as well as subregional and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, have taken measures, as appropriate, towards the implementation of the provisions of the Agreement,
	Welcoming also the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and its Committee on Fisheries and the 2005 Rome Declaration on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, adopted on 12 March 2005,3 and recognizing that the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ("the Code")4 and its associated international plans of action set out principles and global standards of behaviour for responsible practices for conservation of fisheries resources and the management and development of fisheries, 
	Welcoming further the outcomes, including the decisions and recommendations, of the twenty-eighth session of the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, held from 2 to 6 March 2009,5
	Noting with concern that effective management of marine capture fisheries has been made difficult in some areas by unreliable information and data caused by, inter alia, unreported and misreported fish catch and fishing effort and that this lack of accurate data contributes to overfishing in some areas, 
	Recognizing the significant contribution of sustainable fisheries to food security, income, wealth and poverty alleviation for present and future generations,
	Recognizing also the urgent need for action at all levels to ensure the long-term sustainable use and management of fisheries resources through the wide application of the precautionary approach and ecosystem approaches, 
	Expressing concern over the current and projected adverse effects of climate change on food security and the sustainability of fisheries, and noting in that regard the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the United Nations Environment Programme,
	Deploring the fact that fish stocks, including straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, in many parts of the world are overfished or subject to sparsely regulated and heavy fishing efforts, as a result of, inter alia, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, inadequate flag State control and enforcement, including monitoring, control and surveillance measures, inadequate regulatory measures, harmful fisheries subsidies and overcapacity, as well as inadequate port State control, as highlighted in the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2008,6 
	Concerned that a limited number of States have taken measures to implement, individually and through regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, the International Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing Capacity adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,7
	Recalling the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,7
	Particularly concerned that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing constitutes a serious threat to fish stocks and marine habitats and ecosystems, to the detriment of sustainable fisheries as well as the food security and the economies of many States, particularly developing States, 
	Concerned that some operators increasingly take advantage of the globalization of fishery markets to trade fishery products stemming from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and make economic profits from those operations, which constitutes an incentive for them to pursue their activities,
	Recognizing that effective deterrence and combating of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has significant financial and other resource implications,
	Recognizing also the duty provided in the Convention, the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas ("the Compliance Agreement"),8 the Agreement and the Code for flag States to exercise effective control over fishing vessels flying their flag, and vessels flying their flag which provide support to fishing vessels, to ensure that the activities of such fishing and support vessels do not undermine the effectiveness of conservation and management measures taken in accordance with international law and adopted at the national, subregional, regional or global levels,
	Recalling paragraph 46 of its resolution 63/112, and welcoming in this regard the convening by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations of the Expert Consultation on Flag State Performance, held in Rome from 23 to 26 June 2009, 
	Noting the obligation of all States, in accordance with international law, as reflected in the relevant provisions of the Convention, to cooperate in the conservation and management of living marine resources, and recognizing the importance of coordination and cooperation at the global, regional, subregional as well as national levels in the areas, inter alia, of marine scientific research, data collection, information-sharing, capacity-building and training for the conservation, management and sustainable development of marine living resources, 
	Acknowledging the importance of ocean data buoy systems moored in areas beyond national jurisdiction to sustainable development, promoting safety at sea and limiting human vulnerability to natural disasters, due to their use in weather and marine forecasts, fisheries management, tsunami forecasts and climate prediction, and expressing concern that most damage to ocean data buoys, such as moored buoys and tsunameters, frequently results from actions taken by some fishing operations which render the buoys inoperable, 
	Recognizing the need for States, individually and through regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, to continue to develop and implement, consistent with international law, effective port State measures to combat overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, the critical need for cooperation with developing States to build their capacity, and the importance of cooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the International Maritime Organization in this regard,
	Welcoming, in this regard, the approval by the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations of the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing9 and its opening for signature on 22 November 2009,
	Concerned that marine pollution from all sources, including vessels and, in particular, land-based sources, constitutes a serious threat to human health and safety, endangers fish stocks, marine biodiversity and marine and coastal habitats and has significant costs to local and national economies, 
	Recognizing that marine debris is a global transboundary pollution problem and that, due to the many different types and sources of marine debris, different approaches to their prevention and removal are necessary, 
	Noting that the contribution of sustainable aquaculture to global fish supplies continues to respond to opportunities in developing countries to enhance local food security and poverty alleviation and, together with the efforts of other aquaculture producing countries, will make a significant contribution to meeting future demands in fish consumption, bearing in mind article 9 of the Code, 
	Calling attention to the circumstances affecting fisheries in many developing States, in particular African States and small island developing States, and recognizing the urgent need for capacity-building, including the transfer of marine technology and in particular fisheries-related technology, to enhance the ability of such States to meet their obligations and exercise their rights under international instruments, in order to realize the benefits from fisheries resources, 
	Recognizing the need for appropriate measures to minimize by-catch, waste, discards, including high-grading, loss of fishing gear and other factors which adversely affect fish stocks and may also have undesirable effects on the economies and food security of small island developing States, other developing coastal States, and subsistence fishing communities,
	Recognizing also the need to further integrate ecosystem approaches into fisheries conservation and management and, more generally, the importance of applying ecosystem approaches to the management of human activities in the ocean, and noting in this regard the Reykjavik Declaration on Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem,10 the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations related to guidelines for the implementation of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management and the importance of this approach to relevant provisions of the Agreement and the Code, as well as decision VII/1111 and other relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, 
	Recognizing further the economic and cultural importance of sharks in many countries, the biological importance of sharks in the marine ecosystem as key predatory species, the vulnerability of certain shark species to overexploitation, the fact that some are threatened with extinction, the need for measures to promote the long-term conservation, management and sustainable use of shark populations and fisheries, and the relevance of the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 1999,7 in providing guidance on the development of such measures, 
	Reaffirming its support for the initiative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and relevant subregional and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements on the conservation and management of sharks, and noting with concern that basic data on shark stocks and harvests continue to be lacking, that only a small number of countries have implemented the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, and that not all regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements have adopted conservation and management measures for directed shark fisheries and for the regulation of by-catch of sharks from other fisheries,
	Expressing concern that, despite the adoption of General Assembly resolution 46/215 of 20 December 1991, the practice of large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing still exists and remains a threat to marine living resources, 
	Expressing concern also over reports of continued losses of seabirds, particularly albatrosses and petrels, as well as other marine species, including sharks, fin-fish species and marine turtles, as a result of incidental mortality in fishing operations, particularly longline fishing, and other activities, while recognizing considerable efforts by States and through various regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to reduce by-catch in longline fishing,

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

53/211.	Financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola

    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

    Bearing in mind Security Council resolutions 626 (1988) of 20 December 1988, by which the Council established the United Nations Angola Verification Mission, 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991, by which the Council decided to entrust a new mandate to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (thenceforth called the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II), 976 (1995) of 8 February 1995, by which the Council authorized the establishment of a peacekeeping operation (thenceforth called the United Nations Angola Verification Mission III), 1118 (1997) of 30 June 1997, by which the Council decided to establish, as from 1 July 1997, the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola, and its subsequent resolutions, the latest of which was resolution 1213 (1998) of 3 December 1998,

    Recalling its resolution 43/231 of 16 February 1989 on the financing of the Verification Mission and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 52/8 C of 26 June 1998,


    Reaffirming that the costs of the Observer Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

    Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Observer Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Observer Mission,

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Observer Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

    1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola as at 30 November 1998, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 105.4 million United States dollars, representing 9 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission to the period ending 30 June 1997 and from the inception of the Observer Mission to the period ending 31 October 1998, notes that some 18 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

    2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

    3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

    4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure the payment of their assessed contributions to the Observer Mission in full and on time;

    5.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;2

    6.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Observer Mission is administered with maximum efficiency and economy;

    8.	Reiterates the request set out in paragraph 9 of its resolution 52/8 C;
    
    9.	Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that all managers exercising financial responsibility are issued the revised and updated version of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations;

    10.	Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that every official of the United Nations is responsible to the Secretary-General for the regularity of the actions taken by him or her in the course of his or her official duties and that any official who takes any action contrary to the financial rules, or to the administrative instructions issued in connection therewith, may be held personally responsible and financially liable for the consequences of such action;

    11.	Recalls its request to the Secretary-General in its resolution 49/218 of 23 December 1994 to 
include full implementation of the Financial Regulations and Rules of the United Nations as a specific performance indicator in the performance appraisal of all managers;

    13.

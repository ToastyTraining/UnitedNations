	The General Assembly, 
	Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
	Recalling that internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border,1 
	Recognizing that internally displaced persons are to enjoy, in full equality, the same rights and freedoms under international and domestic law as do other persons in their country, 
	Deeply disturbed by the alarmingly high numbers of internally displaced persons throughout the world, for reasons including violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, armed conflict, persecution, violence and other reasons, including terrorism, as well as natural and human-made disasters, who receive inadequate protection and assistance, and conscious of the serious challenges that this is creating for host communities, national and local authorities and the international community, 
	Mindful of the significant humanitarian assistance required to meet the needs of people in protracted situations of internal displacement and of the large gap between needs and resources, 
	Recalling the very large number of people who are displaced within national borders and the potential for such persons to seek protection and assistance in other countries as refugees or migrants, and noting the need for reflection on effective strategies to ensure adequate protection and assistance for internally displaced persons in this regard, including the need for comprehensive and disaggregated data and other measures aimed at preventing and reducing such displacements, 
	Recognizing the increase in the number and scale of natural disasters, including those related to the adverse effects of climate change, which in certain instances may contribute to displacement and additional pressure on host communities, encouraging the United Nations and all relevant actors to strengthen efforts in cooperation with national Governments aimed at addressing the needs of persons displaced internally by natural disasters, including those exacerbated by climate change, and noting in this regard the importance of sharing best practices to prevent and prepare for such displacements, 
	Expressing concern that many millions of people are displaced each year by sudden-onset disasters, and recognizing that disaster risk reduction and climate-change adaptation measures can reduce disaster displacement risk, including through integrating disaster risk reduction strategies into national, regional and global development policies and programmes, 
	Recognizing that the vulnerability of internally displaced persons may increase when their host communities are affected by disasters, 
	Conscious of the human rights, humanitarian and development dimensions, as well as the possible peacebuilding and transitional justice dimensions, of internal displacement, including in protracted displacement situations, and the responsibilities of States, with the support of the international community, to ensure the provision of protection and assistance, including by respecting and protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all internally displaced persons, with a view to finding durable solutions, 
	Conscious also of the specific needs of those who may be particularly vulnerable, including women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities, and the need to ensure that their specific needs are met through the provision of adequate protection and access to assistance, 
	Recognizing that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development2 seeks to address the needs of the most vulnerable, including internally displaced persons, and that addressing the needs of internally displaced persons can help countries to achieve their overall development goals, 
	Emphasizing that States have the primary responsibility to provide protection and assistance to internally displaced persons within their jurisdiction, without discrimination, as well as to address the root causes of the displacement problem and to support all durable solutions in appropriate cooperation with those displaced, their hosts, civil society, local authorities, development actors, the private sector and the international community,

	Noting the need to address the root causes of displacement and for increased awareness within the international community of the issue of internal displacement worldwide, including the situation of millions living in protracted situations of displacement, many of them outside camp settings and in urban areas, and the urgency of providing adequate humanitarian assistance and protection to internally displaced persons, ensuring protection from landmines and other explosive remnants of war and supporting host communities and local organizations, 
	Noting also the need for finding durable solutions for internally displaced persons in their countries and addressing possible obstacles in this regard, and recognizing that durable solutions include voluntary and sustainable return in safety and with dignity, as well as voluntary local integration in the areas to which persons have been displaced or voluntary settlement in another part of the country, without prejudice to the right of internally displaced persons to leave their country or to seek asylum, 
	Recognizing the important contributions made by national and local authorities and host communities to protect and assist internally displaced persons, acknowledging that the hosting of large groups of internally displaced persons can put pressure on those authorities and communities, and recognizing also the importance of supporting host communities, as well as local capacities, by addressing their needs, 
	Emphasizing that all durable solutions for internally displaced persons should be approached from a humanitarian and development perspective and should involve the timely engagement of internally displaced persons and host communities, 
	Underlining the necessity of safe and unhindered humanitarian access for the relevant United Nations agencies and humanitarian organizations to internally displaced persons, including those residing in conflict areas, in accordance with international law, 
	Expressing particular concern at the increased level of discrimination experienced by internally displaced persons, 
	Recalling the relevant norms of international law, including international human rights law, international humanitarian law and international refugee law, and recognizing that the protection of internally displaced persons has been strengthened by identifying, reaffirming and consolidating specific standards for their protection, in particular through the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement,3 
	Recalling also the relevance of international humanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions of 19494 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977,5 as a vital legal framework for the protection of and assistance to civilians in armed conflict and under foreign occupation, including internally displaced persons, 
	Recognizing that violations of international humanitarian law can cause displacement, and recalling that displacement could be reduced if international humanitarian law was respected by all parties to armed conflict, in particular the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution, as well as the prohibition of forced displacement of the civilian population, unless the security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons so demand,6 
	Welcoming the increasing dissemination, promotion, application and integration into domestic laws and policies of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement when dealing with situations of internal displacement, 
	Recognizing that 2018 marks the twentieth anniversary of the issuance of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, and acknowledging that this offers an important opportunity to raise awareness of those standards and of the plight of internally displaced persons in all regions of the world, 
	Deploring practices of forced displacement and their negative consequences for the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by large groups of populations, and recalling the relevant provisions of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court that define the deportation or forcible transfer of population as a crime against humanity and the unlawful deportation, transfer or ordering of the displacement of the civilian population as war crimes,7

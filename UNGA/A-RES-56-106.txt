	Noting with appreciation that the prospects for humanitarian, rehabilitation and development activities have been more favourable in some parts of the country, owing to the formation of stronger administrative structures, the commitment shown to re-establishing the rule of law in general and the leadership shown by some regional authorities and by civil society groups in attempting to establish an inclusive alternative to the faction-ridden past of Somalia,
	Noting with appreciation also the efforts of the United Nations system aimed at working directly with Somali communities at the local level, whenever possible, and emphasizing the need for coordination with the Transitional National Government and with local and regional authorities,
	Welcoming the continued focus of the United Nations, in partnership with Somali elders, other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level, concerned Somali organizations and professionals in the diaspora and non-governmental organizations, on a programme of assistance, including both humanitarian and developmental approaches, given the varying conditions in different areas,

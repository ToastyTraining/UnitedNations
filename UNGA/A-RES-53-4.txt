	Concerned that, since the adoption of its resolutions 47/19, 48/16, 49/9, 50/10, 51/17 and 52/10, further measures of that nature aimed at strengthening and extending the economic, commercial and financial embargo against Cuba continue to be promulgated and applied, and concerned also about the adverse effects of such measures on the Cuban people and on Cuban nationals living in other countries,

	2.	Reiterates its call on all States to refrain from promulgating and applying laws and measures of the kind referred to in the preamble to the present resolution in conformity with their obligations under the Charter of the United Nations and international law, which, inter alia, reaffirmed the freedom of trade and navigation;

	3.	Once again urges States that have and continue to apply such laws and measures to take the necessary steps to repeal or invalidate them as soon as possible in accordance with their legal regime;

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the appropriate organs and agencies of the United Nations system, to prepare a report on the implementation of the present resolution in the light of the purposes and principles of the Charter and international law and to submit it to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session;

	5.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-fourth session the item entitled "Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and financial embargo imposed by the United States of America against Cuba".

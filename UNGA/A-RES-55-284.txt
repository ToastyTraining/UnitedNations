		55/284.	2001-2010: Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 49/135 of 19 December 1994 and 50/128 of 20 December 1995 concerning the struggle against malaria in the developing countries, particularly in Africa,
	Bearing in mind the relevant resolutions of the Economic and Social Council relating to the struggle against malaria and diarrhoeal diseases, in particular its resolution 1998/36 of 30 July 1998,
	Acknowledging that it is important and necessary for countries where malaria is endemic to adopt appropriate strategies to combat malaria, one of the most deadly of all tropical diseases, which annually causes approximately one million deaths in Africa, where nine out of every ten cases of malaria occur,
	Taking note of the declarations and decisions on health issues adopted by the Organization of African Unity, in particular the Declaration and Plan of Action on the "Roll Back Malaria" initiative adopted at the Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held in Abuja on 24 and 25 April 2000, as well as decision AHG/Dec.155 (XXXVI) concerning the implementation of that Declaration and Plan of Action, adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its thirty-sixth ordinary session, held in Lomé from 10 to 12 July 2000,1
	Acknowledging the efforts of the World Health Organization and other partners to fight malaria over the years, including the launching of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership in 1998,
	Recognizing that malaria-related ill health and deaths throughout the world can be eliminated with political commitment and commensurate resources if the public is educated and sensitized about malaria and appropriate health services are made available in countries where the disease is endemic,
	Emphasizing that the international community has an essential role to play in strengthening the support and assistance provided to developing countries, particularly African countries, in their efforts to reduce the incidence of malaria and mitigate its negative effects,
	Emphasizing also the importance of implementing the United Nations Millennium Declaration,2 and welcoming, in this connection, the commitments of Member States to respond to the specific needs of Africa,
	1.	Proclaims the period 2001-2010 the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa;
	2.	Takes note with satisfaction of the continuing efforts of developing countries, particularly those in African countries, to combat malaria through the formulation of plans and strategies at the national, regional and continental levels, despite their limited financial, technical and human resources;
	3.	Stresses that the proclamation of the Decade will stimulate the efforts of African countries and the international community not only to roll back malaria worldwide, in particular in Africa where the burden is heaviest, but also to prevent its spread to previously malaria-free areas;
	4.	Appeals to the international community, United Nations bodies, international and regional organizations and non-governmental organizations to allocate substantial new and additional resources, including through the new global fund to fight HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis, launched by the Group of Eight Major Industrialized Countries at its Genoa Summit, held from 20 to 22 July 2001, and by the Secretary-General, for developing countries, particularly in Africa, with a view to enabling them to implement fully the Plan of Action adopted in Abuja for the "Roll Back Malaria" initiative;
	5.	Commends the World Health Organization and its partners, and urges them to provide the necessary support for its ongoing measures to combat malaria in developing countries, particularly in Africa, and to provide the assistance necessary for African States to meet their objectives;
	6.	Calls for joint comprehensive efforts between Africa and the international community to ensure that by 2005 the following targets are achieved:
	(a)	At least 60 per cent of those at risk for malaria, particularly pregnant women and children under five years of age, shall benefit from the most suitable combination of personal and community protective measures, such as insecticide-treated bednets and other interventions that are accessible and affordable, to prevent infection and suffering;
	(b)	At least 60 per cent of all pregnant women who are at risk for malaria, especially those in their first pregnancies, shall have access to chemoprophylaxis or presumptive intermittent treatment;
	(c)	At least 60 per cent of those suffering from malaria shall have prompt access to and shall be able to use correct, affordable and appropriate treatment within twenty-four hours of the onset of symptoms;
	7.	Reiterates the need to ensure that measures to reduce malaria transmission risks, including environmental management, are included in development planning and activities;
	8.	Requests the Secretary-General, acting in close collaboration with the Director-General of the World Health Organization, developing countries and regional organizations, including the Organization of African Unity, to conduct in 2005 an evaluation of the measures taken and progress made towards the achievement of the mid-term targets, the means of implementation provided by the international community in this regard and the overall goals of the Decade, and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session;
	9.	Also requests the Secretary-General to report to it at its fifty-seventh session on the implementation of the present resolution.

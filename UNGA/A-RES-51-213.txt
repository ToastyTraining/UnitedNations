	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/51/740)]


51/213.Financing of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission,1 the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions2 and the related comments and observations in the reports of the Office of Internal Oversight Services3 and the Board of Auditors,4

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolutions 626 (1988) of 20 December 1988, by which the Council established the United Nations Angola Verification Mission, 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991, by which the Council decided to entrust a new mandate to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (thenceforth called the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II), 976 (1995) of 8 February 1995, by which the Council authorized the establishment of a peacekeeping operation (thenceforth called the United Nations Angola Verification Mission III) and its subsequent resolutions, the latest of which was resolution 1087 (1996) of 11 December 1996, in which the Council extended the mandate of the Verification Mission until 28 February 1997,


	Recalling its resolution 43/231 of 16 February 1989 on the financing of the Verification Mission and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 50/209 B of 7 June 1996,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Verification Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Verification Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Verification Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	Concerned that the Secretary-General continues to face difficulties in meeting the obligations of the Verification Mission on a current basis, including reimbursement to current and former troop-contributing States,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission as at 10 December 1996, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 127,520,046 United States dollars, representing 23 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Verification Mission to the period ending 11 December 1996, notes that some 19 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

	4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure the payment of their assessed contributions to the Verification Mission in full and on time;

	8.	Decides to appropriate the amount of 137,978,400 dollars gross (134,980,800 dollars net) for the maintenance of the Verification Mission for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997, inclusive of the amount of 4,048,400 dollars for the support account for peacekeeping operations, in addition to the amount of 170,118,500 dollars gross (166,984,100 dollars net) already appropriated for the period from 1 July to 31 December 1996 under the provisions of General Assembly resolution 50/209 B;

	9.	Decides also, as an ad hoc arrangement, to apportion the amount of 137,978,400 dollars gross (134,980,800 dollars net) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 among Member States at a monthly rate of 22,996,400 dollars gross (22,496,800 dollars net) beginning 1 January 1997, in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995 and 50/224 of 11 April 1996 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and 50/451 B of 23 December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the year 1997, as set out in its resolution 49/19 B of 23 December 1994 and its decision 50/471 A of 23 December 1995, subject to the decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the Verification Mission beyond 28 February 1997;

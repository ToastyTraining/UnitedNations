	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[without reference to a Main Committee (A/48/L.22 and Add.1)]


48/20.Emergency action to combat locust infestation in Africa


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling the international strategy for the fight against locust infestation, particularly in Africa, adopted by the Economic and Social Council in its resolution 1989/98 of 26 July 1989 and endorsed by the General Assembly in its decision 44/438 of 19 December 1989,

	Also recalling its resolution 42/169 of 11 December 1987 on the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, which included locust infestations among the types of natural disasters to be covered by the Decade,

	Deeply concerned at the exceptional seriousness and real dangers of the current locust infestation in Africa and concerned at its resulting economic, social and environmental consequences, including the reduction of agricultural output and the displacement of affected populations,

	Aware that current campaigns for locust control have so far been unable to put an end to the infestation, in particular because of the limited financial resources of the affected countries, and convinced that the fight against this plague, because of its recurrent nature, requires increased and coordinated mobilization of appropriate human, scientific, technical, material and financial resources,

	Bearing in mind the recommendations of the meeting of the Ministers of Agriculture responsible for locust control of the countries of the Maghreb and of the Sahel, held at Algiers on 27 September 1993, 1/

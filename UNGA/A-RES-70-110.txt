[without reference to a Main Committee (A/70/L.37)] 
70/110.	The impacts of the 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon
	The General Assembly,
	Noting that the El Niño phenomenon has a recurring character and can lead to extensive natural hazards with the potential to seriously affect humankind,
	Reaffirming the importance of developing strategies at the national, subregional, regional and international levels that aim to prevent, mitigate and repair the adverse socioeconomic and environmental impacts of the El Niño phenomenon, the effects of which are already affecting some regions,
	Recalling the Sendai Declaration1 and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030,2 adopted at the Third United Nations World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction,
	Noting with concern that, according to the El Niño/La Niña update of 16 November 2015 of the World Meteorological Organization, as of October 2015 both the ocean and the atmosphere over the tropical areas of the Pacific Ocean indicated the presence of a strong El Niño phenomenon,
	Recognizing that the 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon is already occurring and that it is likely to have a global impact, in particular on developing countries,
	Stressing that the majority of international seasonal climate outlook models indicate that the 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon will strengthen slightly before the end of 2015 and that its peak three-month average strength, expected to occur from the period between October and December 2015 to the period between December 2015 and February 2016, would place it among the three strongest previous El Niño events since 1950 and may place it among the two strongest,
	Recognizing that the impacts of the 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon are already evident in some regions and are expected to be felt in other regions in the next two to six months,
	Stressing the importance of inclusiveness within the United Nations development system and that no country be left behind in the implementation of the present resolution,
	1.	Reaffirms the importance of developing strategies at the national, subregional, regional and international levels that aim to prevent, mitigate and repair the adverse socioeconomic and environmental impacts of the 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon, while recognizing ongoing national initiatives by affected countries to strengthen their capacities;
	2.	Recognizes the continued efforts by the Governments of Ecuador and Spain, the World Meteorological Organization and the inter-agency secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction to support the International Research Centre on El Niño at Guayaquil, Ecuador, and encourages them and other members of the international community to continue to make such contributions for the advancement of the Centre;
	3.	Notes the assistance provided to Governments by the International Research Centre on El Niño and by other Governments and institutions in the development of early warning systems that allow for the implementation of anticipatory risk reduction measures that contribute to the reduction of the potential human, economic and environmental impacts of the phenomenon;
	4.	Recognizes the technical and scientific support of the World Meteorological Organization in producing regionally coordinated monthly and seasonal forecasts, in particular its establishment of a consensus mechanism for the development of updates on El Niño/La Niña conditions, which receives contributions from several climate centres, and also recognizes various initiatives undertaken by different countries to strengthen national and regional capacities;
	5.	Encourages the World Meteorological Organization, in this regard, to continue to strengthen collaboration and the exchange of data and information with relevant institutions;
	6.	Calls upon the international community to urgently provide financial, technical and capacity-building support to countries that are affected by the 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon;
	7.	Calls upon the relevant organizations of the United Nations system, within their respective mandates and resources, to ensure that no country is left behind in the implementation of the present resolution;
	8.	Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, under a sub-item entitled "Disaster risk reduction" of the item entitled "Sustainable development", a section addressing the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of the 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon, in addition to the section requested in its resolution 69/218 of 19 December 2014;
	9.	Decides to convene, given the global urgency of the 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon, a plenary meeting of the General Assembly in 2016, during its seventy-first session, to discuss action-oriented recommendations to address the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of the 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon;
	10.	Invites the Economic and Social Council to devote adequate time during its 2016 session to address the socioeconomic and environmental impacts of the 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon as a global emergency issue, building upon the expertise of the regional commissions and the specialized agencies and relevant bodies of the United Nations system.

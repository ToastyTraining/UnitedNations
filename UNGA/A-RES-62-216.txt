Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 22 December 2007
[on the report of the First Committee (A/62/392)]
62/216.	United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa


	The General Assembly,
	Mindful of the provisions of Article 11, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations stipulating that a function of the General Assembly is to consider the general principles of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security, including the principles governing disarmament and arms limitation,
	Recalling its resolutions 40/151 G of 16 December 1985, 41/60 D of 3 December 1986, 42/39 J of 30 November 1987 and 43/76 D of 7 December 1988 on the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, and its resolutions 46/36 F of 6 December 1991 and 47/52 G of 9 December 1992 on regional disarmament, including confidence-building measures,
	Recalling also its resolutions 48/76 E of 16 December 1993, 49/76 D of 15 December 1994, 50/71 C of 12 December 1995, 51/46 E of 10 December 1996, 52/220 of 22 December 1997, 53/78 C of 4 December 1998, 54/55 B of 1 December 1999, 55/34 D of 20 November 2000, 56/25 D of 29 November 2001, 57/91 of 22 November 2002, 58/61 of 8 December 2003, 59/101 of 3 December 2004, 60/86 of 8 December 2005 and 61/93 of 6 December 2006, 
	Aware of the important role that the Regional Centre can play in promoting confidence-building and arms-limitation measures at the regional level, thereby promoting progress in the area of sustainable development,
	Taking into account the need to establish close cooperation between the Regional Centre and the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, in particular its institutions in the field of peace, disarmament and security, as well as with relevant United Nations bodies and programmes in Africa for greater effectiveness,
	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,1 in which he stated that the Regional Centre's ability to fulfil its mandate continued to be hampered by the lack of funding, in particular core funding,
	Deeply concerned that, as noted in the report of the Secretary-General, voluntary contributions continued to decline and remained insufficient for the Regional Centre to fulfil its mandate effectively and efficiently, and that there is no foreseeable reliable source of funding that would ensure its operational sustainability,
	Recalling that the General Assembly, in its resolution 60/86, requested the Secretary-General to establish, within existing resources, a Consultative Mechanism of interested States, in particular African States, for the reorganization of the Regional Centre,
	1.	Notes with satisfaction the conclusion of the work of the Consultative Mechanism for the Reorganization of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, which made concrete recommendations on the Centre's future work programme, as well as on its staffing and funding;2
	2.	Notes with appreciation the recommendations of the Consultative Mechanism on the Regional Centre's future work programme, as well as on its staffing and funding;
	3.	Invites the Regional Centre, taking into account the availability of financial resources, to focus its actions on the priorities identified in the recommendations of the Consultative Mechanism;
	4.	Recommends that three posts (one Professional at the P-3 level and two General Service (Other level)) be established and added to the structure of the Regional Centre, and funded from the regular budget, as recommended by the Consultative Mechanism;
	5.	Also recommends that the operating costs of the Regional Centre be funded from the regular budget;
	6.	Urges all States, as well as international governmental and non-governmental organizations and foundations, to make voluntary contributions in order to strengthen the programmes and activities of the Regional Centre and facilitate their implementation;
	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to provide the necessary support to the Regional Centre for better achievements and results;
	8.	Also requests the Secretary-General to facilitate close cooperation between the Regional Centre and the African Union, in particular in the areas of peace, security and development, and to continue to provide assistance towards stabilizing the financial situation of the Centre;
	9.	Further requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session on the implementation of the present resolution;
	10.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-third session the item entitled "United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa".

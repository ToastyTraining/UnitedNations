	5.	Decides that the Commission on Population and Development, which is currently scheduled to consider at its thirty-second session a comprehensive report of the Secretary-General on the outcome of the quinquennial review and appraisal of the implementation of the Programme of Action, should serve as the preparatory body for the final preparations for the special session for the overall review and appraisal of the implementation of the Programme of Action, reporting through the Economic and Social Council, and in that regard notes that the comprehensive report of the Secretary-General should also contain an overall assessment of the progress achieved and constraints faced in the implementation of the Programme of Action, as well as recommendations for future action;

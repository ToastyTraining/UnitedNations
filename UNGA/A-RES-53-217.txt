    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the review of procurement-related arbitration cases,1

    2.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to it, for consideration at an early stage during its fifty-fourth session, a comprehensive report, taking into account the recommendations of the Office of Internal Oversight Services and the views expressed by Member States on the issue of arbitration, which should cover, inter alia:

    (a)	The reasons for arbitration cases;

    (b)	The roles and mandates of various Secretariat structures and negotiating teams in arbitration and settlement processes;

    (c)	The sources of funding for arbitration awards and settlement payments;
    

    (d)	The selection of outside legal counsels and provisions to preclude conflict of interest;

    (e)	Disciplinary action taken against staff members responsible for wrongdoing that resulted in arbitration;

    (f)	Pending arbitration cases;

    (g)	Measures taken or proposed to prevent or reduce contract disputes which might lead to arbitration in the future;

    3.	Also requests the Secretary-General, without prejudice to the obligations of the United Nations under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law,2 to keep Member States duly informed of all arbitration and settlement cases, inter alia, by clearly identifying such cases as separate items in corresponding financial performance reports and indicating corrective and disciplinary measures taken in this regard.

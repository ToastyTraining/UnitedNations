49/230.Financing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force
in Cyprus


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary
Questions, 2/

	Recalling Security Council resolution 186 (1964) of 4 March 1964, by which the Council established the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus, and Council resolution 927 (1994) of 15 June 1994, by which the Council further renewed the mandate of the Force until 31 December 1994,

	Recalling also its resolution 48/244 of 5 April 1994 on the financing of the Force,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Force that are not covered by voluntary contributions are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling its previous decision regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force by certain Governments,

	Expressing its appreciation to all those Member States and Observer States that have made voluntary contributions to the Special Account established for the financing of the Force for the period prior to 16 June 1993,

	Noting that voluntary contributions were insufficient to cover all of the costs of the Force, including those incurred by troop-contributing Governments prior to 16 June 1993, and regretting the absence of an adequate response to appeals for voluntary contributions, including that contained in the letter dated 17 May 1994 from the Secretary-General to
all Member States, 3/

	The General Assembly,
	Recalling Articles 1 and 101 of the Charter of the United Nations, as well as Article 8, which provides that the United Nations shall place no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs,
	Recalling also the goal, contained in the Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women,1 of achieving overall gender equality, particularly at the Professional level and above, by 2000 and the further actions and initiatives set out in the outcome document adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-third special session entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century",2
	Recalling further its resolution 55/69 of 4 December 2000 on the improvement of the status of women in the United Nations system,
	Taking note of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2001/50 of 24 April 2001 on integrating the human rights of women throughout the United Nations system,3 in particular paragraph 13, in which the Commission recognizes that gender mainstreaming will strongly benefit from the enhanced and full participation of women, including at the higher levels of decision-making in the United Nations system,
	Welcoming the decision of the Secretary-General to include, in the performance appraisal of managers, information on the opportunities presented for the selection of women candidates and on progress made in improving women's representation, including efforts made to identify women candidates,
	Welcoming also the proposed system-wide medium-term plan for the advancement of women, 2002-2005, as recommended to the Economic and Social Council by the Commission on the Status of Women at its forty-fifth session,4
	Taking into account the continuing lack of representation or underrepresentation of women from certain countries, in particular from developing countries, including least developed countries and small island developing States, and from countries with economies in transition,
	Noting with appreciation those departments and offices that have achieved the goal of gender balance, as well as those departments that have met or exceeded the goal of 50 per cent in the selection of women candidates for vacant posts in the past year,
	Welcoming the progress made in maintaining and improving the representation of women at some levels of the Secretariat, in particular in the category of geographical appointments, and welcoming the fact that the percentage of women appointed and promoted in the Secretariat has been maintained or increased, but expressing concern that progress in improving the representation of women at the senior and policy-making levels has been negligible,
	Expressing concern that there are currently no women acting as special representatives or envoys,
	Noting that the statistics on the representation of women in the organizations of the United Nations system are not fully up to date,
	1.	Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General5 and the actions described therein;
	2.	Reaffirms the urgent goal of achieving 50/50 gender distribution in all categories of posts within the United Nations system, especially at senior and policy-making levels, with full respect for the principle of equitable geographical distribution, in conformity with Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, and also taking into account the continuing lack of representation or underrepresentation of women from certain countries, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition;

	4.	Regrets that the goal of 50/50 gender distribution was not met by the end of 2000, and urges the Secretary-General to redouble his efforts to realize significant progress towards this goal in the near future;
	5.	Expresses concern that, in five departments and offices of the Secretariat, women still account for less than 30 per cent of staff, and encourages the Secretary-General to intensify his efforts to meet the goal of gender balance within all departments and offices of the Secretariat;

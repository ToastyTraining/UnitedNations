	2/	Resolution 2625 (XXV), annex.

	Expressing its appreciation for the progress achieved by the International Law Commission in its elaboration of a draft statute for an international criminal court, 3/ and noting the constructive debate in the Sixth Committee pertaining to this question,

	Considering that experience has demonstrated the usefulness of structuring the debate on the report of the International Law Commission in the Sixth Committee in such a manner that conditions are provided for concentrated attention on each of the main topics dealt with in the report, and that this process is facilitated when the Commission indicates specific issues on which expressions of views by Governments are of particular interest for the continuation of its work,

	2.	Expresses its appreciation to the International Law Commission for the work accomplished at that session;

	4.	Takes note with appreciation of chapter II of the report of the International Law Commission, entitled "Draft Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind", which was devoted to the question of a draft statute for an international criminal court; 3/

	6.	Requests the International Law Commission to continue its work as a matter of priority on this question with a view to elaborating a draft statute, if possible at its forty-sixth session in 1994, taking into account the views expressed during the debate in the Sixth Committee as well as any written comments received from States;

                       

     3/     Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-eighth Session, Supplement No. 10 (A/48/10), annex.


     7.     Endorses the decision of the International Law Commission to include in its agenda the topics "The law and practice relating to reservations to treaties" and "State succession and its impact on the

	(b)	To continue to pay special attention to indicating in its annual report, for each topic, those specific issues on which expressions of views by Governments, either in the Sixth Committee or in written form, would be of particular interest for the continuation of its work;

	11.	Takes note of the comments of the International Law Commission on the question of the duration of its session, as presented in its report, 6/ and expresses the view that the requirements of the work for the progressive development of international law and its codification and the magnitude and complexity of the subjects on the agenda of the Commission make it desirable that the usual duration of its sessions be maintained;

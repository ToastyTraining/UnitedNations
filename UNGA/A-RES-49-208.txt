	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 48/121 of 20 December 1993, in which it endorsed the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 1/ adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights,

	Reaffirming the view of the World Conference on Human Rights that the promotion and protection of human rights is a matter of priority for the international community,

	Welcoming Commission on Human Rights resolution 1994/95 of 9 March 1994 on the World Conference on Human Rights, 2/ in which, inter alia, the Commission called upon all special representatives, special rapporteurs, independent experts and thematic working groups of the Commission to take fully into account the recommendations contained in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action within their respective mandates,


	Recognizing the urgency of eliminating denials and violations of human rights, as expressed in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,

	Bearing in mind that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action provide the United Nations and the international community with a coherent framework of principles, objectives and means for promoting and protecting human rights,

	Noting that the activities envisaged in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action add further to the workload and the responsibilities of the United Nations human rights system and that the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session took the initial steps towards bridging the gap between resources and the mandated outputs,

	Recalling the request of the World Conference on Human Rights to the Secretary-General and the General Assembly to take immediate steps to increase substantially the resources for the human rights programme from within the existing and future regular budgets of the United Nations,

	Taking note of the view of the Secretary-General, as expressed in his report, 3/ that a prompt endorsement of a detailed plan of implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, together with the related necessary financial decisions, could positively facilitate the achievement of the broad range of objectives in human rights set forth by the World Conference on Human Rights,

	Noting that at the first regular session of 1994 of the Administrative Committee on Coordination, in April 1994, the executive heads of all United Nations agencies discussed the implications of the results of the Conference for their respective programmes and committed themselves to supporting the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in the coordination of United Nations organs, bodies and the specialized agencies whose activities deal with human rights, as set out in General Assembly resolution 48/141 of 20 December 1993,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the follow-up to the World Conference on Human Rights 4/ and the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 5/

	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the follow-up to the World Conference on Human Rights 4/ and of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights; 5/

	2.	Endorses the view of the Secretary-General 6/ that, if adequately implemented, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action will be a milestone in history, and that this requires concerted efforts on the part of Governments and national human rights institutions, international organizations, United Nations human rights bodies and non-governmental organizations;


	3.	Endorses the reaffirmation in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action of the importance of the promotion of universal respect for, and observance and protection of, all human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations;

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to ensure as wide a distribution of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action as possible;

	5.	Urges all States to continue to give widespread publicity to the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action in order to promote increased awareness of human rights and fundamental freedoms;

	6.	Calls upon all States to take further action with a view to the full realization of human rights in the light of the recommendations of the Conference;

	7.	Requests the Secretary-General, the General Assembly, the Commission on Human Rights and other organs and bodies of the United Nations system related to human rights to take further action with a view to the full implementation of all the recommendations of the Conference;

	8.	Reiterates the request of the Conference that immediate steps be taken to increase substantially the resources for the human rights programme from within the existing and future regular budgets of the United Nations;

	9.	Requests the High Commissioner for Human Rights, as the United Nations official with principal responsibility for United Nations human rights activities, to submit, no later than 15 February 1995, for the preparation of the programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997, a report with a detailed plan on the human and financial resource requirements of the implementation of the recommendations of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action that have been endorsed by the competent United Nations organs or on which those organs have taken decisions;

	10.	Also requests the High Commissioner to include in his annual report to the General Assembly a section on the measures taken and the progress achieved in the comprehensive implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action;


	11.	Decides to consider this question at its fiftieth session under the sub-item entitled "Comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action".

	Reaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports and complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with concrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to address the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels for sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity, 
	Recognizing the need for a broader and a more people-centred preventive approach to disaster risk and that disaster risk reduction practices need to be 
multi-hazard and multisectoral, inclusive and accessible in order to be efficient and effective, 
	Reiterating the call in the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction for the substantial reduction of disaster risk and losses in lives, livelihoods and health and in the economic, physical, social, cultural and environmental assets of persons, businesses, communities and countries, 
	Expressing its deep concern at the number and scale of disasters and their devastating impact in recent years, which have resulted in massive loss of life and long-term negative economic, social and environmental consequences for vulnerable societies throughout the world, and which hamper the achievement of their sustainable development, in particular that of developing countries, 
	Noting the convening of the International Conference on the Implementation of the Health Aspects of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction
2015-2030, held in Bangkok on 10 and 11 March 2016, which adopted the Bangkok Principles for the implementation of the health aspects of the Sendai Framework as a contribution to the Sendai Framework to build resilient health systems, 
	Recognizing climate change as one of the drivers of disaster risk, and that the adverse effects of climate change, as contributors to environmental degradation and extreme weather events, may, in certain instances, among other factors, contribute to disaster-induced human mobility, and in this regard acknowledging the internationally agreed outcomes adopted under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,9 
	Welcoming the Paris Agreement10 and its early entry into force, encouraging all its parties to fully implement the Agreement, and parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that have not yet done so to deposit their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, where appropriate, as soon as possible, 
	Reaffirming the importance of strengthening international cooperation in the face of disasters, weather-related hazards, including the El Niño phenomenon, and the adverse effects of climate change to prevent major damage and ensure an adequate response and attention to the affected populations in a timely manner in order to ensure resilience to their impacts, and recognizing in this regard the importance of developing coordinated multi-hazard early warning systems, 
	Recognizing that disaster-prone developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, small island developing States, landlocked developing countries and African countries, as well as middle-income countries facing specific challenges, warrant particular attention in view of their higher vulnerability and risk levels, which often greatly exceed their capacity to respond to and recover from disasters, and recognizing also that similar attention and appropriate assistance should also be extended to other disaster-prone countries with specific characteristics, such as archipelagic countries, as well as countries with extensive coastlines, 
	Welcoming the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III), held in Quito from 17 to 20 October 2016, and recognizing the importance of achieving the global targets of the Sendai Framework for the implementation of the New Urban Agenda,11

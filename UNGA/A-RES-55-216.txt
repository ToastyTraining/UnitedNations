	Recalling that, while the primary responsibility for the development of Africa remains with African countries, the international community has a stake in it and in supporting the efforts of those countries in that regard,

	Expressing its concern at the overall declining trends of resource flows to Africa, in particular the low levels of foreign direct investment and official development assistance, which have seriously constrained, among other things, the timely implementation of the New Agenda, 
	Recognizing the crucial need for a substantial increase in financial resource flows to Africa to support the implementation of development activities of African countries,

	5.	Stresses the urgent need to facilitate the full integration of African countries into the world economy, and in this context calls for continued efforts to enhance market access for products of export interest to African economies and support for the efforts towards diversification and the building of supply capacity, and in this regard welcomes the efforts of the European Union and the United States, in particular through the Cotonou Agreement of the European Union and the African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States6 and the United States Africa Growth and Opportunity Act;
	6.	Expresses its appreciation to the developed countries that have agreed to and have reached the target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for overall official development assistance, and calls upon the developed countries that have not yet done so to strengthen their efforts to achieve, as soon as possible, the agreed target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for overall official development assistance, taking into account the special development needs of the least developed countries in Africa;
	7.	Urges all States, international financial institutions, in particular the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, multilateral organizations and development funds and programmes of the United Nations system, as well as intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, to pursue with renewed vigour, and as a matter of urgency, the realization of the goals and objectives embodied in the New Agenda;

	10.	Also reaffirms its decision contained in resolution 51/32 to conduct in 2002 the final review and appraisal of the New Agenda in line with the provisions of section II, paragraph 43 (e), of the annex to resolution 46/151;

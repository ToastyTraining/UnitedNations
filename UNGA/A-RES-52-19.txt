	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[without reference to a Main Committee (A/52/L.20/Rev.1)]


52/19.Cooperation between the United Nations and the Economic Cooperation Organization


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 48/2 of 13 October 1993, by which it granted observer status to the Economic Cooperation Organization,

	Recalling also that the Charter of the United Nations provides for the existence of regional arrangements or agencies for dealing with such matters as maintenance of international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action, provided that their activities are consistent with the purposes and principles of the United Nations,

	Recalling further its resolution 51/21 of 27 November 1996, in which it urged the specialized agencies and other organizations and programmes of the United Nations system to initiate, maintain and increase consultation and programmes with the Economic Cooperation Organization and its associated institutions in the attainment of their objectives,

	Bearing in mind that the Treaty of Izmir, signed at Izmir, Turkey, on 12 March 1977, later revised at Ashgabat on 11 May 1996 and signed at Izmir on 14 September 1996, created a permanent body for intraregional cooperation, consultation and coordination in order to enhance economic, social and cultural development, and bearing in mind also the measures being taken by the Economic Cooperation Organization aimed at the reorganization and restructuring of the organization,

	Convinced that the maintenance and further strengthening of the cooperation between the United Nations system and the Economic Cooperation Organization promote the implementation of the goals and principles of those organizations,


	1.	Takes note of the decision of the heads of State and Government of the States members of the Economic Cooperation Organization welcoming the adoption of General Assembly resolution 51/21 on cooperation between the two organizations and endorsing the cooperative arrangements entered into by the Economic Cooperation Organization with various entities of the United Nations system for joint efforts towards the implementation of the economic projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization;

	2.	Notes with appreciation the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of resolution 51/21,1  and invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations to continue his efforts, in consultation with the Secretary-General of the Economic Cooperation Organization, to promote and expand cooperation and coordination between the two secretariats in order to increase the capacity of the two organizations to attain their common objectives;

	3.	Notes with satisfaction the emphasis placed in the Ashgabat Declaration, issued by the Extraordinary Summit Meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the States members of the Economic Cooperation Organization, held at Ashgabat on 13 and 14 May 1997,2 on the meaningful development of economic cooperation in priority areas of transport and communications and energy with a view to facilitating the access of the landlocked States members of the Economic Cooperation Organization to world markets;

	4.	Welcomes the continuation of efforts towards further consolidation of interregional consultations and exchange of views on issues of common concern through such useful forums as the annual meeting of the executive heads of Asia's subregional organizations and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, which held its third meeting at Tehran in May 1997;

	5.	Urges the specialized agencies and other organizations and programmes of the United Nations system to continue and increase consultation and cooperation with the Economic Cooperation Organization and its associated institutions in the attainment of their objectives;

	6.	Invites the relevant international financial institutions to give appropriate consideration to regional development plans, including projects and programmes of the Economic Cooperation Organization, in order to extend their assistance in the implementation of these programmes and, in particular, to the establishment of a comprehensive transport and communications infrastructure in the region of the Economic Cooperation Organization that would provide the landlocked countries with greater mobility to promote interregional trade and to establish mutually beneficial economic and commercial interaction with other regions;

	7.	Invites the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, as the regional arm of the United Nations, to assume a more active role in promoting cooperation with the Economic Cooperation Organization, and reiterates in this regard its request made in paragraph 5 of resolution 51/21 in the context of the report to be submitted by the Executive Secretary of the Commission to the Commission at its fifty-fourth session, in 1998;

	8.	Takes note with satisfaction of the fact that it is proposed to introduce the Advance Cargo Information System and the Automated System for Customs Data of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, which are compatible with other systems, in the States members of the Economic  Cooperation Organization, with the technical assistance of, inter alia, the Conference;


	9.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session a report on the implementation of the present resolution;

	10.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-third session the item entitled "Cooperation between the United Nations and the Economic Cooperation Organization".

	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 2099 (XX) of 20 December 1965, in which the General Assembly established the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law to contribute towards a better knowledge of international law as a means of strengthening international peace and security and promoting friendly relations and cooperation among States,
	Noting that this year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the Programme of Assistance, and emphasizing the importance of ensuring the successful continuation of the Programme for the benefit of present and future generations of lawyers,
	Reaffirming that the Programme of Assistance is a core activity of the United Nations and that it has provided the foundation for the efforts of the United Nations to promote a better knowledge of international law for half a century,
	Recognizing the major contribution of the Programme of Assistance to the teaching and dissemination of international law for the benefit of lawyers in all countries, legal systems and regions of the world for half a century,
	Emphasizing the important contribution of the Programme of Assistance, in particular the United Nations Regional Courses in International Law and the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law, to the furtherance of United Nations rule of law programmes and activities,
	Reaffirming that the increasing demand for international law training and dissemination activities creates new challenges for the Programme of Assistance,
	Recognizing the importance of the Programme of Assistance effectively reaching its beneficiaries, including with regard to languages, while bearing in mind limitations on available resources,
	Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the Programme of Assistance1 and the views of the Advisory Committee on the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law, which are contained in the report,
	Noting with concern that the activities of the Programme of Assistance, in particular the organization of the United Nations Regional Courses in International Law on a regular basis and the further development of the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law, cannot be sustained with the resources available under the current programme budget, notwithstanding its resolutions 64/113 of 16 December 2009, 65/25 of 6 December 2010, 66/97 of 9 December 2011, 67/91 of 14 December 2012 and 68/110 of 16 December 2013,
	Noting with regret that the United Nations Regional Courses in International Law for Asia-Pacific and for Latin America and the Caribbean were not held in 2014 and in 2015 owing to insufficient funds and that no United Nations Regional Course in International Law for Latin America and the Caribbean has been held in the past decade,
	Noting with regret also that the Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe Memorial Fellowship on the Law of the Sea was not awarded in 2014 owing to insufficient voluntary contributions, and noting with appreciation that this fellowship was awarded in 2015,
	Considering that international law should occupy an appropriate place in the teaching of legal disciplines at all universities,
	Convinced that States, international and regional organizations, universities and institutions should be encouraged to give further support to the Programme of Assistance and to increase their activities to promote the teaching, study, dissemination and wider appreciation of international law, in particular those activities which are of special benefit to persons from developing countries,
	Reaffirming that in the conduct of the Programme of Assistance it would be desirable to use as far as possible the resources and facilities made available by Member States, international and regional organizations, universities, institutions and others,
	Reaffirming also the hope that, in appointing highly qualified lecturers for the seminars to be held within the framework of the fellowship programmes in international law, account would be taken of the need to secure the representation of major legal systems and balance among various geographical regions,
	1.

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/53/533)]


53/11.Gratis personnel provided by Governments and other entities


	The General Assembly,

	Reaffirming its resolutions 51/243 of 15 September 1997, 52/217, 52/218 and 52/220 of 22 December 1997 and 52/234 and 52/248 of 26 June 1998,

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

	1.	Reaffirms that the circumstances in which the Secretary-General can accept gratis personnel should be in strict compliance with paragraphs 4 (a) and (b) of General Assembly resolution 51/243;

	2.	Notes that the decrease in type II gratis personnel is continuing, as requested by the General Assembly in paragraph 9 of  resolution 51/243;

	3.	Notes with concern that the information provided by the Secretary-General fails to demonstrate the extent to which all gratis personnel accepted in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of the Secretariat provide very specialized expertise not available within the Organization, as is required under paragraph 4 (a) of  resolution 51/243;


	4.	Also notes with concern the observation by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions3 that the cases of the acceptance of gratis personnel by the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 and the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994, referred to in the reports of the Secretary-General,4 contravene the provisions of  resolution 51/243 which do not allow acceptance of gratis personnel on the grounds of failure by the Secretariat to recruit staff in an expeditious manner;

	5.	Further notes with concern that the extension of the deadline for the submission of applications for the replacement of type II gratis personnel has resulted in cases of differential treatment among Member States;

	6.	Takes note of the commitment and assurances of the Secretary-General that the recruitment process for the replacement of type II gratis personnel, including those in the two international tribunals, will be completed by 28 February 1999, in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 52/234 and 52/248;

	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to  improve further the planning and implementation mechanism in human resources management in a transparent manner and secure the independent and efficient work of the Secretariat pursuant to Articles 100 and 101 of the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly;

	8.	Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that recruitment for any new posts arising from the phase-out of gratis personnel is carried out on as wide a geographical basis as possible with due regard to gender;

	9.	Further requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly on the implementation of the phase-out of type II gratis personnel at its resumed fifty-third session.

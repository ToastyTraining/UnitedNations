	Recognizing the significant health and environmental impacts of nuclear testing conducted by the administering Power in the Territory over a 30-year period, and further recognizing the concerns in the Territory related to the consequences of those activities on the lives and health of the people, especially children and vulnerable groups, as well as the environment of the region,

	2.	Also reaffirms that it is ultimately for the people of French Polynesia to determine freely their future political status in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter, the Declaration and the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, and in that connection calls upon the administering Power, in cooperation with the territorial Government and appropriate bodies of the United Nations system, to develop political education programmes for the Territory in order to foster an awareness among the people of French Polynesia of their right to self-determination in conformity with the legitimate political status options, based on the principles clearly defined in Assembly resolution 1541 (XV) and other relevant resolutions and decisions;

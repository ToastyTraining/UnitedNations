	Recognizing that coordinated health, social and economic policies are needed to address the health of the most vulnerable and marginalized, who are often victims of inequity, inequality, discrimination, stigmatization, social exclusion and violence, and are the most exposed to health risk factors, owing mostly to their living conditions, poor health literacy and lack of access to health care and other relevant services,

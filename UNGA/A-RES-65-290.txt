Notes the overall benefits of the restructuring of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field Support, and requests the Secretary-General to assess these benefits and to continue to make every effort to enhance the capacity of the Organization to manage and sustain peacekeeping operations;
	15.	Underlines the crucial importance of ensuring that the lessons learned and best practices of peacekeeping missions are adequately captured, processed and incorporated into guidelines and policies, particularly with regard to peacebuilding efforts by peacekeepers and peacekeeping operations in transition, and in this regard recognizes the significant role of the Peacekeeping Best Practices Section and best practices officers on the ground; 
	16.	Notes that the strategy for early peacebuilding is still being developed by the Secretariat, and in this regard requests the Secretary-General to consult closely, throughout the process of the preparation of the strategy, with Member States, the Peacebuilding Commission, United Nations agencies, funds and programmes and all other relevant Secretariat entities, and underlines that specific peacebuilding tasks undertaken by peacekeeping missions should be based on the priorities of the country concerned and on the specific context;

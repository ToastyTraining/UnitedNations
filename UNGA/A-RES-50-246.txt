	Recalling Security Council resolution 991 (1995) of 28 April 1995, by which the Council affirmed that the mandate of the Observer Mission would terminate as at 30 April 1995, as well as all previous Security Council resolutions on the Observer Mission,

	Recalling also its resolution 45/267 of 21 June 1991 on the financing of the Observer Mission and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which was decision 50/447 of 22 December 1995,

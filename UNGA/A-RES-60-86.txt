[on the report of the First Committee (A/60/464)]
60/86.	United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa


	The General Assembly,
	Mindful of the provisions of Article 11, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations stipulating that a function of the General Assembly is to consider the general principles of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security, including the principles governing disarmament and arms limitation,
	Recalling its resolutions 40/151 G of 16 December 1985, 41/60 D of 3 December 1986, 42/39 J of 30 November 1987 and 43/76 D of 7 December 1988 on the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, and its resolutions 46/36 F of 6 December 1991 and 47/52 G of 9 December 1992 on regional disarmament, including confidence-building measures,
	Recalling also its resolutions 48/76 E of 16 December 1993, 49/76 D of 15 December 1994, 50/71 C of 12 December 1995, 51/46 E of 10 December 1996, 52/220 of 22 December 1997, 53/78 C of 4 December 1998, 54/55 B of 1 December 1999, 55/34 D of 20 November 2000, 56/25 D of 29 November 2001, 57/91 of 22 November 2002, 58/61 of 8 December 2003 and 59/101 of 3 December 2004,
	Aware of the important role that the Regional Centre can play in promoting confidence-building and arms-limitation measures at the regional level, thereby promoting progress in the area of sustainable development,
	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,1 in which it was stated that the Regional Centre continued to carry out its mandate under very strenuous financial and operational difficulties,
	Concerned that the activities and staffing of the Regional Centre have been reduced in view of the limited resources at its disposal, 
	Deeply concerned that, as noted in the report of the Secretary-General, the future of the Regional Centre looks bleak owing to the lack of a reliable source of funding that would ensure the sustainability of its operations,
	Bearing in mind the efforts undertaken to mobilize the necessary resources for the operational costs of the Regional Centre,
	Conscious of the need to review the mandate and programmes of the Regional Centre in the light of developments in the field of peace and security in Africa since its establishment,
	Taking into account the need to establish close cooperation between the Regional Centre and the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, in particular its institutions in the field of peace, disarmament and security, as well as with relevant United Nations bodies and programmes in Africa for greater effectiveness,
	1.	Requests the Secretary-General to establish, within existing resources, a consultative mechanism of interested States, in particular African States, for the reorganization of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session;
	2.	Appeals once again to all States, as well as to international governmental and non-governmental organizations and foundations, to make voluntary contributions in order to strengthen the programmes and activities of the Regional Centre and facilitate their implementation;
	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to provide the necessary support to the Regional Centre for better achievements and results;
	4.	Also requests the Secretary-General to facilitate close cooperation between the Regional Centre and the African Union, in particular in the areas of peace, security and development, and to continue to provide assistance towards stabilizing the financial situation of the Centre;
	5.	Appeals in particular to the Regional Centre, in cooperation with the African Union, regional and subregional organizations and the African States, to take steps to promote the consistent implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects;2
	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session on the implementation of the present resolution;
	7.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-first session the item entitled "United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa".

	The General Assembly,

	Bearing in mind that among the purposes of the United Nations are those of developing friendly relations among nations based on respect for the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples and taking other appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace, as well as achieving international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion,

	Desirous of achieving further progress in international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms,

	Deeply convinced that United Nations action in this field should be based not only on a profound understanding of the broad range of problems existing in all societies but also on full respect for the political, economic and social realities of each of them, in strict compliance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and for the basic purpose of promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms through international cooperation,

	Reaffirming all its resolutions in this regard,

	1.	Reiterates that, by virtue of the principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, all peoples have the right freely to determine, without external interference, their political status and to pursue their economic, social and cultural development and that every State has the duty to respect that right within the provisions of the Charter, including respect for territorial integrity;

	4.	Considers that international cooperation in this field should make an effective and practical contribution to the urgent task of preventing mass and flagrant violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and to the strengthening of international peace and security;

	5.	Reaffirms that the promotion, protection and full realization of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, as legitimate concerns of the world community, should be guided by the principles of non-selectivity, impartiality and objectivity and should not be used for political ends;

	6.	Underlines the importance of the promotion of dialogue on human rights issues;


	7.	Emphasizes that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated and that, as such, the international community must treat them globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing and with the same emphasis;

	11.	Invites Member States to consider adopting, as appropriate, within the framework of their respective legal systems and in accordance with their obligations under international law, especially the Charter, and international human rights instruments, the measures that they may deem appropriate to achieve further progress in international cooperation in promoting and encouraging respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all;

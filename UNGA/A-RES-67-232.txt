[on the report of the Third Committee (A/67/457/Add.2 and Corr.1)]
67/232.	Committee against Torture


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,1
	Welcoming the work of the Committee against Torture, and encouraging sustained efforts by the Committee to improve the efficiency of its working methods,
	Regretting the persistent backlog of reports of States parties to the Convention and individual communications awaiting consideration, which prevents the Committee from considering reports and communications in a timely manner and without undue delay,
	Recalling its resolutions 66/254 of 23 February 2012 and 66/295 of 17 September 2012 on the intergovernmental process of the General Assembly on strengthening and enhancing the effective functioning of the human rights treaty body system, and recognizing in this regard that a long-term solution to the problem of the increasing backlog of reports of States parties to the Convention awaiting review by the Committee may be found in this context,
	Noting the request of the Committee that the General Assembly authorize an extension of its meeting time by two weeks in 2013 and in 2014,2
	Noting also that the Committee has only 10 members and normally meets for only two sessions of three weeks a year,
	Noting further that the estimated budgetary requirements of the requested extension of meeting time for 2014 will be dealt with in the context of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015, while bearing in mind the need to make the best possible use of resources,
	1.	Expresses its appreciation for the efforts made so far by the Committee against Torture to improve the efficiency of its working methods, including with a view to further harmonizing the working methods of the treaty bodies, and urges the Committee to continue its activities in this regard;
	2.	Authorizes the Committee, without prejudice to the intergovernmental process of the General Assembly on strengthening and enhancing the effective functioning of the human rights treaty body system, to continue to meet for an additional week per session as a temporary measure, with effect from May 2013 until the end of November 2014, in order to address the backlog of reports of States parties to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment1 and individual complaints awaiting consideration.

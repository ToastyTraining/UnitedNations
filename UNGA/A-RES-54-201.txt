    8.	Reaffirms that capacity-building in science and technology in developing countries should remain a priority issue in the United Nations agenda, and urges that international cooperation efforts be intensified and strengthened towards endogenous capacity-building in developing countries in science and technology, including their capacity to utilize scientific and technological developments from abroad as well as to modify and adapt them to suit local conditions;

    9.	Recognizes the role of the public and private sectors, industry and academia in science and technology for development, in particular in the transfer and development of science and technology capabilities;

    10.	Stresses the importance of facilitating the transfer of technology to developing countries, in particular in knowledge-intensive sectors, with the objective of enhancing technological capacities, capabilities and skills in developing countries;


    11.

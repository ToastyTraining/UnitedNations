    The General Assembly,

    Reaffirming that all Member States have an obligation to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms as stated in the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 the International Covenants on Human Rights2 and other applicable human rights instruments and to fulfil the obligations that they have undertaken under the various international instruments in this field,

    Mindful that the Sudan is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,2 the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,2 the Convention on the Rights of the Child,3 the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights4 and the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949,5


    Recalling its previous resolutions on the situation of human rights in the Sudan, and taking note of Commission on Human Rights resolution 1999/15 of 23 April 1999,6

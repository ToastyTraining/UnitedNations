	1.	Condemns the long-standing and ongoing systematic, widespread and gross violations of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, including those which the commission of inquiry on human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, established by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 22/13 of 21 March 2013,11 has said may amount to crimes against humanity, and the continuing impunity for such violations; 
	2.	Expresses its very serious concern at: 
	(a)	The persistence of continuing reports of violations of human rights, including the detailed findings made by the commission of inquiry in its report,2 such as: 
	(i)	Torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including inhuman conditions of detention; rape; public executions; extrajudicial and arbitrary detention; the absence of due process and the rule of law, including fair trial guarantees and an independent judiciary; extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions; the imposition of the death penalty for political and religious reasons; collective punishments extending up to three generations; and the extensive use of forced labour; 
	(ii)	The existence of an extensive system of political prison camps, where a vast number of persons are deprived of their liberty and subjected to deplorable conditions, including forced labour, and where alarming violations of human rights are perpetrated; 
	(iii)	The forcible transfer of populations and the limitations imposed on every person who wishes to move freely within the country and travel abroad, including the punishment of those who leave or try to leave the country without permission, or their families, as well as punishment of persons who are returned; 
	(iv)	The situation of refugees and asylum seekers expelled or returned to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and retaliations against citizens of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea who have been repatriated from abroad, leading to punishments of internment, torture, other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, sexual violence or the death penalty, and in this regard strongly urges all States to respect the fundamental principle of non-refoulement, to treat those who seek refuge humanely and to ensure unhindered access to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and his Office, with a view to protecting the human rights of those who seek refuge, and once again urges States parties to comply with their obligations under the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees12 and the 1967 Protocol thereto13 in relation to refugees from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea who are covered by those instruments; 
	(v)	All-pervasive and severe restrictions, both online and offline, on the freedoms of thought, conscience, religion or belief, opinion and expression, peaceful assembly and association, the right to privacy and equal access to information, by such means as the unlawful and arbitrary surveillance, persecution, torture, imprisonment and, in some instances, summary executions of individuals exercising their freedom of opinion and expression, religion or belief, and their families, and the right of everyone to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives, of his or her country; 
	(vi)	Violations of economic, social and cultural rights, which have led to food insecurity, severe hunger, malnutrition, widespread health problems and other hardship for the population in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in particular for women, children, persons with disabilities, older persons and political prisoners; 
	(vii)	Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, in particular the creation of internal conditions that force women and girls to leave the country and make them extremely vulnerable to trafficking in persons for the purpose of prostitution, domestic servitude or forced marriage and the subjection of women and girls to gender-based discrimination, including in the political and social spheres, forced abortions and other forms of sexual and gender-based violence; 
	(viii)	Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of children, in particular the continued lack of access to basic economic, social and cultural rights for many children, and in this regard notes the particularly vulnerable situation faced by, inter alia, returned or repatriated children, street children, children with disabilities, children whose parents are detained, children living in detention or in institutions and children in conflict with the law; 
	(ix)	Violations of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons with disabilities, especially violations involving the use of collective camps and coercive measures that target the rights of persons with disabilities to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and allegations of the possible use of persons with disabilities in medical testing, forced relocation to rural areas and separation of children with disabilities from their parents; 
	(x)	Violations of workers' rights, including the right to freedom of association and effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the right to strike as defined by the obligations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,5 and the prohibition of the economic exploitation of children and of any harmful or hazardous work of children as defined by the obligations of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea under the Convention on the Rights of the Child,6 as well as the exploitation of workers sent abroad from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to work under conditions that reportedly amount to forced labour, and recalls paragraph 11 of Security Council resolution 2371 (2017) and paragraph 17 of resolution 2375 (2017), in which the Council decided that Member States shall not provide work authorizations for nationals of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in their jurisdictions in connection with admission to their territories unless otherwise determined by the relevant sanctions committee on a case-by-case basis; 
	(xi)	Discrimination based on the songbun system, which classifies people on the basis of State-assigned social class and birth and also includes consideration of political opinions and religion;
	(b)	The continued refusal of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to extend an invitation to the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the situation of human rights in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or to extend cooperation to the Special Rapporteur and several other United Nations special procedures in accordance with their terms of reference, as well as to other United Nations human rights mechanisms; 
	(c)	The continued lack of acknowledgement by the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea of the grave human rights situation in the country and its consequential lack of action to report on the state of implementation of the recommendations contained in the outcome of its first universal periodic review14 and to give consideration to the concluding observations of the treaty bodies; 
	3.	Condemns the systematic abduction, denial of repatriation and subsequent enforced disappearance of persons, including those from other countries, on a large scale and as a matter of State policy, and in this regard strongly calls upon the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea urgently to resolve these issues of international concern, in a transparent manner, including by ensuring the immediate return of abductees; 
	4.	Underscores its very serious concern regarding reports of torture, summary executions, arbitrary detention, abductions and other forms of human rights violations and abuses that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea commits against citizens of other countries within and outside of its territory; 
	5.	Expresses its very deep concern at the precarious humanitarian situation in the country, which could rapidly deteriorate owing to limited resilience to natural disasters and to government policies causing limitations in the availability of and access to adequate food, compounded by structural weaknesses in agricultural production resulting in significant shortages of diversified food and the State restrictions on the cultivation of and trade in foodstuffs, as well as the prevalence of chronic and acute malnutrition, particularly among the most vulnerable groups, pregnant and lactating women, children, persons with disabilities, older persons and political prisoners, and urges the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in this regard, to take preventive and remedial action, cooperating with international donor agencies and in accordance with international standards for monitoring humanitarian assistance;

	7.	Also welcomes the adoption of Human Rights Council resolution 34/24,1 in which the Council provided for the strengthening of the capacity of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, including its field-based structure in Seoul, to allow the implementation of relevant recommendations made by the group of independent experts on accountability, in its report submitted to the Human Rights Council at its thirty-fourth session, aimed at strengthening current monitoring and documentation efforts, establishing a central repository for information and evidence and having experts in legal accountability assess all information and testimonies with a view to developing possible strategies to be used in any future accountability process; 
	8.	Reiterates its appreciation for the work of the commission of inquiry, recognizes the continuing importance of its report, and regrets that the commission received no cooperation from the authorities of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, including with regard to access to the country; 
	9.

	10.	Expresses its concern at the failure of the authorities of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to prosecute those responsible for human rights violations, including violations which the commission of inquiry has said may amount to crimes against humanity, and encourages the international community to cooperate with accountability efforts and to ensure that such crimes do not remain unpunished; 
	11.	Encourages the Security Council to continue its consideration of the relevant conclusions and recommendations of the commission of inquiry and take appropriate action to ensure accountability, including through consideration of referral of the situation in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the International Criminal Court and consideration of the further development of sanctions in order to target effectively those who appear to be most responsible for human rights violations that the commission has said may constitute crimes against humanity;

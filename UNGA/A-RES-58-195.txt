	2.	Expresses its serious concern at:
	(a)	The continuing violations of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran;
	(b)	The continuing deterioration of the situation with regard to freedom of opinion and expression, especially the increased persecution for the peaceful expression of political views, including arrest and detention without charge or trial; crackdowns by judiciary and security forces against journalists, parliamentarians, students, clerics and academics; and the harsh reactions to student demonstrations, including imprisonment, mistreatment and use of university disciplinary committees against those who participate;

	(h)	The continuing discrimination against persons belonging to minorities, including the Baha'is, Christians, Jews and Sunnis, including cases of arbitrary arrest and detention, the denial of free worship or of publicly carrying out communal affairs and the disregard of property rights;
	(i)	The continuing persecution and arbitrary sentencing to prison of human rights defenders, political opponents, religious dissenters and reformists;
	3.	Calls upon the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran:
	(a)	To abide by its obligations freely undertaken under the International Covenants on Human Rights2 and other international human rights instruments, including those relating to freedom of opinion and expression, the use of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment and the promotion and protection of the human rights of women and girls, and to continue its efforts to consolidate respect for human rights and the rule of law;

	(d)	To expedite judicial reform, to guarantee the dignity of the individual and to ensure the full application of due process of law and fair and transparent procedures by an independent and impartial judiciary, and in this context to ensure respect for the rights of the defence and the equity of verdicts in all instances, including for members of religious minority groups;
	(e)	To appoint an impartial prosecutor, noting the re-establishment, since December 2001, within the Islamic Republic of Iran of the Office of the Prosecutor General;

	5.

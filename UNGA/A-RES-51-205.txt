	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[without reference to a Main Committee (A/51/L.60 and Add.1)]


51/205.Proclamation of 21 November as World Television Day


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 13 (I) of 13 February 1946, in which it stated, inter alia, that the United Nations cannot achieve its purposes unless the peoples of the world are fully informed of its aims and activities,

	Recalling also its resolutions concerning information in service of humanity and United Nations public information policies and activities,

	Reaffirming its commitment to the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and to the principles of freedom of information, as well as to those of the independence, pluralism and diversity of the media,

	Underlining that communications have become one of today's central international issues, not only for their relevance for the world economy, but also for their implications for social and cultural development,

	Recognizing the increasing impact that television has on decision-making by alerting world attention to conflicts and threats to peace and security and its potential role in sharpening the focus on other major issues, including economic and social issues,

	Underlining that the United Nations faces ever-increasing demands to address the major issues facing humankind and that television, as one of today's most powerful communications media, could play a role in presenting these issues to the world,

	Noting with satisfaction the holding at Headquarters, on 21 and 22 November 1996, of the first World Television Forum, where leading media figures met under the auspices of the United Nations to discuss the growing significance of television in today's changing world and to consider how they might enhance their mutual cooperation,


	1.	Decides to proclaim 21 November World Television Day, commemorating the date on which the first World Television Forum was held;

	2.	Invites all Member States to observe World Television Day by encouraging global exchanges of television programmes focusing, among other things, on such issues as peace, security, economic and social development and the enhancement of cultural exchange;

	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all Governments and appropriate non-governmental organizations.

69/149.	Trafficking in women and girls


	The General Assembly,
	Reiterating its strong condemnation of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, which constitutes a serious threat to human dignity, human rights and development,
	Recalling all international conventions that deal specifically with and address issues relevant to the problem of trafficking in women and girls, such as the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime1 and the Protocols thereto, in particular the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,2 and the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,3 the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women4 and the Optional Protocol thereto,5 the Convention on the Rights of the Child6 and the Optional Protocol thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography,7 and the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others,8 as well as relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council and its functional commissions and the Human Rights Council on the issue,
	Recognizing the crucial importance of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, which entered into force on 25 December 2003 and which provided, for the first time, an internationally agreed definition of the crime of trafficking in persons aimed at the prevention of trafficking in persons, the protection of victims and the prosecution of the perpetrators,
	Welcoming the outcome of the seventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, held in Vienna from 6 to 10 October 2014, in which the Conference took a further step towards identifying an appropriate mechanism or mechanisms to review the implementation of the Convention and the Protocols thereto,9
	Reaffirming the provisions pertaining to trafficking in women and girls contained in the outcome documents of relevant international conferences and summits, in particular the strategic objective on the issue of trafficking contained in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women,10
	Reaffirming also the commitment made by world leaders at the Millennium Summit, the 2005 World Summit and the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals to devise, enforce and strengthen effective measures to combat and eliminate all forms of trafficking in persons in order to counter the demand for trafficked victims and to protect the victims,
	Welcoming in particular the efforts of States, United Nations bodies and agencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to address the problem of trafficking in persons, especially women and children, including the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 64/293 of 30 July 2010,
	Taking note of the adoption by the International Labour Conference, at its 103rd session, on 11 June 2014, of the Protocol to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29)11 and Recommendation No. 203 on supplementary measures for the effective suppression of forced labour, of the International Labour Organization, which specify that measures to be taken for the prevention of forced or compulsory labour shall include specific actions against trafficking in persons for the purposes of forced or compulsory labour,
	Welcoming, in the agreed conclusions adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women at its fifty-eighth session,12 the commitment of Governments to take appropriate measures to raise public awareness of the issue of trafficking in persons, particularly women and girls, including the factors that make women and girls vulnerable to trafficking, to discourage, with a view to eliminating, the demand that fosters all forms of exploitation, including sexual exploitation and forced labour, and to review and adopt the laws, regulations and penalties necessary to deal with this issue and publicize them to emphasize that trafficking is a serious crime,
	Welcoming also the observance, on 30 July 2014, of the first World Day against Trafficking in Persons, in the context of the need for raising awareness of the situation of victims of human trafficking and for the promotion and protection of their rights,
	Noting with appreciation the steps taken, including the reports of human rights treaty bodies and the Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, on violence against women, its causes and consequences, on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, and on contemporary forms of slavery, including its causes and consequences, and the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, and by United Nations agencies and other concerned intergovernmental and governmental organizations, within their existing mandates, as well as civil society, to address the serious crime of trafficking in persons, and encouraging them to continue doing so and to share their knowledge and best practices as widely as possible,
	Noting the renewal by the Human Rights Council, at its twenty-sixth session, of the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on trafficking in persons, especially women and children,13 and the fact that part of her task is to integrate a gender- and age-specific perspective throughout the work of her mandate, inter alia, through the identification of gender- and age-specific vulnerabilities in relation to the issue of trafficking in persons,
	Acknowledging the inclusion of gender-related crimes in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,14 which entered into force on 1 July 2002,
	Bearing in mind the obligations of States to exercise due diligence to prevent trafficking in persons, to investigate and punish perpetrators of trafficking in persons and to protect and empower victims, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the victims,
	Seriously concerned that an increasing number of women and girls are being trafficked, including to developed countries, as well as within and between regions and States, and that men and boys are also victims of trafficking, including for sexual exploitation,
	Recognizing that certain efforts against trafficking in persons lack the gender and age sensitivity needed to effectively address the situation of women and girls, who are particularly vulnerable to trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, forced labour, services and other forms of exploitation, thus highlighting the need to incorporate a gender- and age-sensitive approach into all anti-trafficking efforts,
	Recognizing also the need to address the impact of globalization on the particular problem of trafficking in women and children, in particular girls,
	Recognizing further that poverty, unemployment, lack of socioeconomic opportunities, gender-based violence, discrimination and marginalization are some of the contributing factors that make persons vulnerable to trafficking,
	Recognizing the heightened vulnerability to trafficking of women and girls in humanitarian crisis situations, including in conflict and post-conflict environments, natural disasters and other emergency environments,
	Recognizing also the need to reinforce efforts regarding the provision of relevant documents, such as birth registration documents, in order to lower the risk of being trafficked and to help to identify victims of trafficking in persons,
	Recognizing further that, despite the progress made, challenges to preventing and combating trafficking in women and girls remain and that further efforts should be made to adopt adequate legislation and programmes to implement such legislation and to continue improving the collection of reliable data disaggregated by sex and age and of statistics that would allow proper analysis of the nature, extent and risk factors of trafficking in women and girls,
	Recognizing the importance of exploring the link between migration and trafficking in persons in order to further efforts to protect women migrant workers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse,
	Concerned about the use of new information and communications technologies, including the Internet, for purposes of recruiting for the exploitation of the prostitution of others, including for exploiting women and children and for child pornography, paedophilia and any other forms of sexual exploitation of children, as well as for forced marriage and forced labour,
	Concerned also about the increasing activities of transnational criminal organizations and others that profit from international trafficking in persons, especially women and children, without regard to dangerous and inhuman conditions and in flagrant violation of national laws and international standards,
	Noting with concern that women and girls are also vulnerable to the risk of trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal, and in this regard taking note of Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice resolution 23/2, entitled "Preventing and combating trafficking in human organs and trafficking in persons for the purpose of organ removal",15 adopted by the Commission at its twenty-third session,
	Recognizing that victims of trafficking are particularly exposed to racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and that women and girl victims are often subject to multiple forms of discrimination and violence, including on the grounds of their gender, age, ethnicity, disability, culture and religion, as well as their origin, and that those forms of discrimination themselves may fuel trafficking in persons,
	Noting with concern that some of the demand fostering sexual exploitation, exploitative labour and the illegal removal of organs is met by trafficking in persons,
	Acknowledging that women and girl victims of trafficking, on account of their gender, are further disadvantaged and marginalized by a general lack of information on or awareness and recognition of their human rights and by the stigmatization often associated with trafficking, as well as by the obstacles they meet in gaining access to accurate information and recourse mechanisms in cases of the violation of their rights, and that special measures are required for their protection and to increase their awareness,
	Encouraging the Commission on the Status of Women to consider the issue of trafficking in women and girls at its fifty-ninth session, within the framework of the review of progress made in the implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, as well as opportunities for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women in the post-2015 development agenda,
	Welcoming the decision by the General Assembly, in its resolution 68/309 of 10 September 2014, that the proposal of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals contained in its report16 shall be the main basis for integrating sustainable development goals into the post-2015 development agenda, while recognizing that other inputs will also be considered, in the intergovernmental negotiation process at the sixty-ninth session of the Assembly, and taking note with appreciation of the reference to ensuring gender equality and empowerment of all women and girls contained in the proposal of the Open Working Group,
	Reaffirming the importance of bilateral, subregional, regional and international cooperation mechanisms and initiatives, including information exchanges on best practices, of Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to address the problem of trafficking in persons, especially women and children,
	Taking note of the second consultative meeting on strengthening partnerships with national rapporteurs on trafficking in persons and equivalent mechanisms, held in Bangkok in May 2014, and the establishment of an informal network of such mechanisms from all over the world in order to address trafficking in persons in a consistent manner, exchange information and best practices and build on different national experiences,
	Reaffirming that global efforts, including international cooperation and technical assistance programmes, to eradicate trafficking in persons, especially women and children, demand the strong political commitment, coordinated and coherent efforts and active cooperation of all Governments of countries of origin, transit and destination,
	Recognizing that policies and programmes for prevention, protection, rehabilitation, repatriation and reintegration should be developed through a gender- and age-sensitive, comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach, with concern for the security of the victims and respect for the full enjoyment of their human rights and with the involvement of all actors in countries of origin, transit and destination,
	Convinced of the need to protect and assist all victims of trafficking, with full respect for the human rights and dignity of the victims,

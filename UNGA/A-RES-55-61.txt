Resolution adopted by the General Assembly

[on the report of the Third Committee (A/55/593)]
55/61.  An effective international legal instrument against corruption


	The General Assembly,
	Noting the corrosive effect that corruption has on democracy, development, the rule of law and economic activity,
	Recalling its resolutions 53/111 of 9 December 1998, by which it established the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of a Convention against Transnational Organized Crime, and 54/126 of 17 December 1999, in which it requested the Ad Hoc Committee to complete its work in 2000,
	Recalling also its resolution 54/128 of 17 December 1999, in which it requested the Ad Hoc Committee to explore the desirability of an international instrument against corruption, either ancillary to or independent of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,1
	Taking note of the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on its seventh session,2 during which it considered the implementation of resolution 54/128,
	Recalling the debates and especially the statements made at the high-level segment and the results of the Tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders,3 in particular the Vienna Declaration on Crime and Justice: Meeting the Challenges of the Twenty-first Century,
	Bearing in mind the need to prepare a broad instrument that takes into account existing international conventions against corruption,
	1.	Recognizes that an effective international legal instrument against corruption, independent of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,1 is desirable;
	2.	Decides to begin the elaboration of such an instrument in Vienna at the headquarters of the United Nations Centre for International Crime Prevention of the United Nations Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention;
	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to prepare a report analysing all relevant international legal instruments, other documents and recommendations addressing corruption,4 considering, inter alia, obligations as regards criminalization of all forms of corruption and international cooperation, regulatory aspects of corruption and the relationship between corruption and money-laundering, and to submit it to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at an inter-sessional meeting in order to allow Member States to provide comments to the Commission prior to its tenth session;
	4.	Requests the Commission, at its tenth session, to review and assess the report of the Secretary-General and, on that basis, to provide recommendations and guidance as to future work on the development of a legal instrument against corruption;
	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to convene, upon completion of the negotiation of the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime and the related protocols, an intergovernmental open-ended expert group to examine and prepare, on the basis of the report of the Secretary-General and of the recommendations of the Commission at its tenth session, draft terms of reference for the negotiation of the future legal instrument against corruption;
	6.	Requests the intergovernmental open-ended expert group to submit the draft terms of reference for the negotiation of the future legal instrument, through the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice and the Economic and Social Council, to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session for adoption;
	7.	Decides to establish an ad hoc committee for the negotiation of such an instrument to start its work in Vienna as soon as the draft terms of reference for such negotiation are adopted;
	8.	Invites donor countries to assist the United Nations in ensuring the effective participation of developing countries, in particular least developed countries, in the work of the intergovernmental open-ended expert group and the ad hoc committee, including travel and local expenses;
	9.	Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Commission and the intergovernmental open-ended expert group with the required facilities and resources to support their work.

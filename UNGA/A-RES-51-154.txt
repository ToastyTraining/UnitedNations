	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/51/712)]


51/154.Financing of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

	Recalling Security Council resolutions 983 (1995) of 31 March 1995, by which the Council decided that the United Nations Protection Force within the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be known as the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force, and 1082 (1996) of 27 November 1996, in which the Council extended the mandate of the Force until 31 May 1997,

	Recalling also its decision 50/481 of 11 April 1996 and its resolution 50/243 of 7 June 1996 on the financing of the Force,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Force are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling its previous decision regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,


	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force by certain Governments,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force as at 30 November 1996, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 10.6 million United States dollars, representing 23 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Force to the period ending 30 November 1996, notes that some 28 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States that have paid their assessed contributions in full;

	4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Force in full and on time;

	5.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;2 

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Force is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

	7.	Decides to appropriate the amount of 4,237,100 dollars gross (4,132,500 dollars net) already authorized and apportioned in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/243 for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 31 May to 30 June 1996;

	8.	Decides also to appropriate the amount of 25,373,400 dollars gross (24,615,600 dollars net) for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997, inclusive of the amount of 632,400 dollars for the support account for peacekeeping operations, in addition to the amount of 26,296,200 dollars gross (25,538,400 dollars net), already appropriated for the period from 1 July to 31 December 1996 under the provisions of General Assembly resolution 50/243;

	9.	Decides further, as an ad hoc arrangement, and taking into account the amount of 26,296,200 dollars gross (25,538,400 dollars net) already apportioned in accordance with General Assembly resolution 50/243, to apportion an additional amount of 25,373,400 dollars gross (24,615,600 dollars net) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 among Member States at a monthly rate of 4,228,900 dollars gross (4,102,600 dollars net) in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995 and 50/224 of 11 April 1996 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and 50/451 B of 23 December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the year 1997, as set out in its resolution 49/19 B of 23 December 1994 and its decision 50/471 A of             23 December 1995, subject to the decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the Force beyond 31 May 1997;


	10.	Decides that, in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955, there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 9 above, their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated additional staff assessment income of 757,800 dollars approved for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997;
	
	11.	Invites voluntary contributions to the Force in cash and in the form of services and supplies acceptable to the Secretary-General, to be administered, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedure established by the General Assembly in its resolutions 43/230 of 21 December 1988, 44/192 A of 21 December 1989 and 45/258 of 3 May 1991;

 	12.	Decides to keep under review during its fifty-first session the agenda item entitled "Financing of the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force".

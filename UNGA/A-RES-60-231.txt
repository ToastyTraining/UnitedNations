	41.

	42.	Urges donors:
	(a)	To ensure, by 2007, a complete and successful replenishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as the HIV/AIDS component of the work programmes of the agencies and programmes of the United Nations system engaged in the fight against HIV/AIDS, and notes that a major part of the international HIV and AIDS financing gap relates to children orphaned or made vulnerable by HIV/AIDS;

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 20 December 2013
[on the report of the Second Committee (A/68/444)]
68/231.	International Year of Pulses, 2016
	The General Assembly,
	Noting that pulses are annual leguminous crops yielding between 1 and 12 grains or seeds of variable size, shape and colour within a pod, used for both food and feed, and that the term "pulses" is limited to crops harvested solely for dry grain, thereby excluding crops harvested green for food, which are classified as vegetable crops, as well as those crops used mainly for oil extraction and leguminous crops that are used exclusively for sowing purposes,1
	Noting also that pulse crops such as lentils, beans, peas and chickpeas are a critical source of plant-based proteins and amino acids for people around the globe, as well as a source of plant-based protein for animals,
	Recalling that the World Food Programme and other food aid initiatives use pulses as a critical part of the general food basket,
	Desiring to focus attention on the role that pulses play as part of sustainable food production aimed towards food security and nutrition,
	Recognizing that pulses are leguminous plants that have nitrogen-fixing properties which can contribute to increasing soil fertility and have a positive impact on the environment,
	Recognizing also that health organizations around the world recommend eating pulses as part of a healthy diet to address obesity, as well as to prevent and help manage chronic diseases such as diabetes, coronary conditions and cancer,
	Believing that such a celebration would create a unique opportunity to encourage connections throughout the food chain that would better utilize pulse-based proteins, further global production of pulses, better utilize crop rotations and address the challenges in the trade of pulses,
	Affirming the need to heighten public awareness of the nutritional benefits of pulses and to further sustainable agriculture,
	Reaffirming that, pursuant to paragraphs 13 and 14 of the annex to Economic and Social Council resolution 1980/67 of 25 July 1980, a year should not be proclaimed before the basic arrangements for its organization and financing have been made,
	Welcoming resolution 6/2013 of 22 June 2013 of the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,
	1.	Decides to declare 2016 the International Year of Pulses;
	2.	Reaffirms Economic and Social Council resolution 1980/67 on international years and anniversaries and General Assembly resolutions 53/199 of 15 December 1998 and 61/185 of 20 December 2006 on the proclamation of international years;
	3.	Invites the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, mindful of provisions contained in the annex to Economic and Social Council resolution 1980/67, to facilitate the implementation of the Year in collaboration with Governments, relevant organizations, non-governmental organizations and all other relevant stakeholders;
	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its seventy-third session a focused and concise report, bearing in mind paragraphs 23 
to 27 of the annex to Economic and Social Council resolution 1980/67, on activities resulting from the implementation of the present resolution, which elaborates on, inter alia, the evaluation of the Year;
	5.	Invites the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to keep the General Assembly informed of progress in this regard;
	6.	Stresses that the costs of all activities that may arise from the implementation of the present resolution above and beyond activities currently within the mandate of the lead agency should be met through voluntary contributions, including from the private sector;
	7.	Invites all relevant stakeholders to make voluntary contributions and to provide other forms of support to the Year.

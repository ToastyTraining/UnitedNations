	The General Assembly,

	Recalling that in its resolution 1911 (XVIII) of 27 November 1963 it expressed the hope that the States of Latin America would take appropriate measures to conclude a treaty that would prohibit nuclear weapons in Latin America,

	Recalling also that in the same resolution it voiced its confidence that, once such a treaty was concluded, all States, and in particular the nuclear-weapon States, would lend it their full cooperation for the effective realization of its peaceful aims,

	Considering that in its resolution 2028 (XX) of 19 November 1965 it established the principle of an acceptable balance of mutual responsibilities and obligations between nuclear-weapon States and those which do not possess such weapons,

	Recalling that the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco) 1/ was opened for signature at Mexico City on 14 February 1967,

	Recalling also that in its preamble the Treaty of Tlatelolco states that military denuclearized zones are not an end in themselves but rather a means for achieving general and complete disarmament at a later stage,

	Recalling further that in its resolution 2286 (XXII) of 5 December 1967 it welcomed with special satisfaction the Treaty of Tlatelolco as an event of historic significance in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to promote international peace and security,


	Recalling that in 1990, 1991 and 1992 the General Conference of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean approved and opened for signature a set of amendments to the Treaty of Tlatelolco, 2/ with the aim of enabling the full entry into force of that instrument,

	Bearing in mind that, with the full adherence in 1995 of Saint Lucia, the Treaty of Tlatelolco is in force for thirty sovereign States of the region,

	Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis ratified the Treaty of Tlatelolco on 18 April 1995,

	Also noting with satisfaction that the Government of Cuba subscribed to the Treaty of Tlatelolco on 25 March 1995, thus contributing to a greater integration among the peoples of Latin America and the Caribbean for the attainment of the aims of the Treaty,

	Further noting with satisfaction that the amended Treaty of Tlatelolco is fully in force for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Jamaica, Mexico, Peru, Suriname and Uruguay,

	1.	Welcomes the concrete steps taken by several countries of the region during the past year for the consolidation of the regime of military denuclearization established by the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco);

	2.	Notes with satisfaction the full adherence of Saint Lucia to the Treaty of Tlatelolco;

	3.	Urges the countries of the region that have not yet done so to deposit their instruments of ratification of the amendments to the Treaty of Tlatelolco approved by the General Conference of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean in its resolutions 267 (E-V) of 3 July 1990, 268 (XII) of 10 May 1991 and 290 (VII) of 26 August 1992;

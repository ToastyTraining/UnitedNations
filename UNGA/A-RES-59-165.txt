Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 20 December 2004
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/59/496)]
59/165.	Working towards the elimination of crimes against women and girls committed in the name of honour


	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming the obligation of all States to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to life, liberty and security of person, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 and reaffirming also the obligations of States parties under human rights instruments, in particular the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,2 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,2 the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women3 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child,4
	Reaffirming also the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action5 and the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women,6 as well as the goals and commitments contained in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women,7 and the outcome document of the special session of the General Assembly entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century",8
	Recalling its resolutions 57/179 of 18 December 2002 and 58/147 of 22 December 2003, as well as Commission on Human Rights resolution 2004/46 of 20 April 2004,9
	Recalling also its resolution 58/185 of 22 December 2003, in which it called for an in-depth study on violence against women, including crimes committed in the name of honour, as well as its resolution 57/190 of 18 December 2002, in which it called for an in-depth study on violence against children,
	Bearing in mind that States have an obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and punish the perpetrators of crimes against women and girls committed in the name of honour and to provide protection to the victims, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms,
	Stressing the need to treat all forms of violence against women and girls, including crimes committed in the name of honour, as a criminal offence, punishable by law,
	Stressing also the need to identify and effectively address the root causes of violence against women, in particular crimes committed in the name of honour, which take many different forms,
	Aware that inadequate data on violence against women, including crimes committed in the name of honour, hinder informed policy analysis, at both the domestic and the international levels, and efforts to eliminate such violence,
	Deeply concerned that women and girls continue to be victims of these crimes, as described in the relevant sections of the reports of the Human Rights Committee, the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women, the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and noting in this regard successive reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on violence against women, its causes and consequences,
	Emphasizing that such crimes are incompatible with all religious and cultural values,
	Emphasizing also that the elimination of crimes against women and girls committed in the name of honour requires greater efforts and commitment on the part of Governments and the international community, inter alia, through international cooperation efforts, and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, and that fundamental changes in societal attitude are required,
	Underlining the importance of the empowerment of women and their effective participation in decision-making and policy-making processes as one of the critical tools to prevent and eliminate crimes against women and girls committed in the name of honour,

	(d)	The work carried out by civil society, including non-governmental organizations, such as women's organizations, grass-roots movements and individuals, in raising awareness of such crimes and their harmful effects;

	(e)	To intensify efforts to raise awareness about the responsibility of men to promote gender equality and bring about change in attitudes to eliminate gender stereotypes, including, specifically, their role in preventing crimes against women and girls committed in the name of honour;
	(f)	To encourage the efforts of the media to engage in awareness-raising campaigns;
	(g)	To encourage, support and implement measures and programmes aimed at increasing the knowledge and understanding of the causes and consequences of crimes against women and girls committed in the name of honour, including the provision of training for those responsible for enforcing the law, such as police personnel and judicial and legal personnel, and to strengthen their capacity to respond to complaints of such crimes in an impartial and effective manner and take necessary measures to ensure the protection of actual and potential victims;
	(h)	To continue to support the work of civil society, including non-governmental organizations, in addressing this issue and to strengthen cooperation with intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations;
	(i)	To establish, strengthen or facilitate, where possible, support services to respond to the needs of actual and potential victims by, inter alia, providing for them the appropriate protection, safe shelter, counselling, legal aid, health-care services, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, psychological health and other relevant areas, rehabilitation and reintegration into society;
	(j)	To address effectively complaints of crimes against women and girls committed in the name of honour, inter alia, by creating, strengthening or facilitating institutional mechanisms so that victims and others can report such crimes in a safe and confidential environment;
	(k)	To gather and disseminate statistical information on the occurrence of such crimes, including information disaggregated by sex and age, and to make any such information available to the Secretariat for use in the in-depth study on violence against women, in accordance with resolution 58/185, and the in-depth study on violence against children, in accordance with resolution 57/190;

	(b)	The relevant human rights treaty bodies, where appropriate, and the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on violence against women, its causes and consequences to continue to address this issue;
	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to report on the implementation of the present resolution in his report on the question of violence against women to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.

	Recalling its resolution 56/116 of 19 December 2001, by which it proclaimed the 10-year period beginning on 1 January 2003 the United Nations Literacy Decade, its resolution 57/166 of 18 December 2002, in which it welcomed the International Plan of Action for the United Nations Literacy Decade,1 and its resolutions 59/149 of 20 December 2004, 61/140 of 19 December 2006, 63/154 of 18 December 2008, 65/183 of 21 December 2010 and 68/132 of 18 December 2013,
	Recalling also the United Nations Millennium Declaration,2 in which Member States resolved to ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, would be able to complete a full course of primary schooling and that girls and boys would have equal access to all levels of education, which requires a renewed commitment to promote literacy for all,
	Reaffirming the Education for All goals, in particular goal 3, on ensuring that the learning needs of all young people and adults are met through equitable access to appropriate learning and life-skills programmes, and goal 4, on achieving a 50 per cent improvement in levels of adult literacy by 2015, especially for women, and equitable access to basic and continuing education for all adults,
	Convinced that literacy is crucial to the acquisition by every child, young person and adult of the essential life skills that will enable them to address the challenges that they may face in life and represents an essential condition of lifelong learning, which is an indispensable means for effective participation in the knowledge societies and economies of the twenty-first century,
	Reaffirming the right of indigenous peoples to have non-discriminatory access to all levels and forms of education provided by States, and recognizing the importance of effective measures to promote access for indigenous individuals, in particular children, to education in their own language, whenever possible, as addressed in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples,3

	Recognizing that literacy is a foundation for lifelong learning, a building block for achieving human rights and fundamental freedoms and a driver of sustainable development and that the United Nations Literacy Decade (2003-2012) had a catalytic effect as a global framework for sustained and focused efforts for the promotion of literacy and literate environments,

	Affirming that the realization of the right to education, especially for girls, contributes to the promotion of human rights, gender equality and the eradication of poverty, as well as to development,
	Recognizing the importance of continuing to implement national programmes and measures to eliminate illiteracy worldwide as reflected in the Dakar Framework for Action on Education for All, adopted on 28 April 2000 at the World Education Forum,5 and in the Millennium Development Goals, and in this regard also recognizing the important contribution of South-South and triangular cooperation through, inter alia, innovative pedagogical methods in literacy,
	Deeply concerned about the persistence of the gender gap in education, which is reflected by the fact that, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, nearly two thirds of the world's non-literate adults are women,
	Concerned that, according to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, one third of the children not attending school are children with disabilities and that the literacy rate among adults with disabilities is as low as 3 per cent in some countries,
	Deeply concerned about the impact of disrupted educational services in humanitarian emergencies on efforts to promote literacy skills, especially for all children and young people,

	6.	Requests the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to continue its coordinating and catalysing role in the fight against illiteracy, including in the context of the agenda for the period following the United Nations Literacy Decade, through developing Member States' capacities in the areas of policies, programme delivery and literacy assessments, scaling up literacy actions for girls and women, reinforcing innovative models of literacy delivery, including through information and communications technologies, and expanding the knowledge base and monitoring and evaluation, as well as advocating literacy on the global agenda and ensuring synergies between different actions, including through multi-stakeholder partnerships and networks;

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 34/14 of 9 November 1979, in which it endorsed the Declaration of Principles and the Programme of Action as adopted by the World Conference on Agrarian Reform and Rural Development,1 and its resolutions 44/78 of 8 December 1989, 48/109 of 20 December 1993 and 50/165 of 22 December 1995,

	Recalling also the importance attached to the problems of rural women by the Nairobi Forward-looking Strategies for the Advancement of Women2 and by the Beijing Declaration3 and the Platform for Action4 adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women,

	Recalling further its resolution 47/174 of 22 December 1992, in which it welcomed the adoption of the Geneva Declaration for Rural Women by the Summit on the Economic Advancement of Rural Women, held at Geneva in February 1992,5 and urged all States to work for the achievement of the goals endorsed in that Declaration,


	Welcoming the growing awareness of Governments of the need for strategies and programmes to improve the situation of women in rural areas,

	Welcoming also the Declaration and Plan of Action adopted by the Microcredit Summit, held in Washington in February 1997,6 in which micro-finance was identified as an important instrument of poverty alleviation, including for rural women,

	Noting with deep concern that the economic and financial crises in many developing countries have severely affected the socio-economic status of women, especially in rural areas, and the continuing rise in the number of rural women living in poverty, including girls and older women,

	Mindful of the need for fuller recognition and appreciation of the contribution of rural women to socio-economic development, including human capital development,

	Mindful also that, despite the global trend towards rapid urbanization, many developing countries are still largely rural,

	Recognizing the urgent need to take appropriate measures aimed at further improving the situation of women in rural areas,

	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the improvement of the situation of women in rural areas;7

	2.

	(a)	Integrating the concerns of rural women into national development policies and programmes, in particular by placing a higher priority on budgetary allocation related to the interests of rural women;

	(b)	Strengthening national machineries and establishing institutional linkages among governmental bodies in various sectors and non-governmental organizations concerned with rural development;

	(c)	Increasing the awareness of rural women of their rights and their role in political and socio-economic development;

	(d)	Increasing the participation of rural women in the decision-making process at the local and national levels;



	(e)	Designing and revising laws to ensure that women have equal access to and control over land, unmediated by male relatives, in order to end land rights discrimination; according women secure use rights and full representation in the decision-making bodies that allocate land and other forms of property, credit, information and new technologies; in the implementation of the Platform for Action of the Fourth World Conference on Women,4 according women full and equal rights to own land and other property, inter alia, through inheritance; acknowledging, in the context of land reform programmes, the equality of women's rights to land and taking other measures to increase land availability to poor women and men;

	(f)	Investing in the human resources of rural women, particularly through health and literacy programmes and social support measures;

	(g)	Promoting and strengthening micro-financing policies and programmes, cooperatives and other employment opportunities;

	(h)	Ensuring that women's unpaid work and contributions to on-farm and off-farm production, including income generated in the informal sector, are visible and recorded in economic surveys and statistics at the national level;

	3.	Requests the international community and relevant United Nations organizations and bodies to promote further the realization of the programmes and projects aimed at the improvement of the situation of rural women within the overall framework of integrated follow-up to recent global conferences;

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to prepare, in consultation with Member States and relevant United Nations organizations, a report on the implementation of the present resolution and to submit it, through the Economic and Social Council, to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session.

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Third Committee (A/49/606)]


49/158.Strengthening the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme, particularly its technical cooperation capacity

	
	The General Assembly,

	Recognizing the direct relevance of crime prevention and criminal justice to sustained development, stability, security and improved quality of life,

	Convinced of the desirability of closer coordination and cooperation among States in combating crime, including drug-related crimes such as terrorism, illicit arms trade and money laundering, and bearing in mind the role that could be played by both the United Nations and regional organizations in this respect,

	Bearing in mind the goals of the United Nations in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice, specifically the reduction of criminality, more efficient and effective law enforcement and administration of justice, respect for human rights and promotion of the highest standards of fairness, humanity and professional conduct,

	Recognizing the urgent need to increase technical cooperation activities to assist countries, particularly developing countries and countries in transition, with their efforts in translating United Nations policy guidelines into practice, including training and upgrading of national capacities,

	Stressing the urgent need to improve regional, interregional and international cooperation and coordination of activities aimed at combating crime in its multifaceted aspects,

	Noting the continued increase in the workload of the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch of the Secretariat, as well as the considerable obstacles to the full and effective implementation of its programme activities, resulting from the lack of appropriate institutional capacity,


	Convinced that the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch can be effective only if it is provided with resources commensurate to its requirements and adequate to allow it to implement its mandates and to respond in a timely and efficient manner to the increasing requests of Member States for its services,

	Recalling Economic and Social Council resolution 1986/11 of 21 May 1986, in which the Council requested the Secretary-General to look critically at the existing structure and level of management of the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch, with a view to strengthening its capacity and status commensurate to its responsibility,

	Recalling also its resolution 46/152 of 18 December 1991 on the creation of an effective United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme, in which it approved the statement of principles and programme of action annexed to the resolution, in which it was recommended to the Secretary-General that an upgrading of the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch into a division should be effected as soon as possible,

	Recalling further its resolution 48/103 of 20 December 1993, in which it reiterated its request to the Secretary-General to strengthen the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme and to upgrade, as a matter of urgency, the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Brancht to a division,

	Recalling its relevant resolutions as well as the decisions of the Economic and Social Council, which accorded a high level of priority to the activities of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme and requested an appropriate share of the overall resources of the United Nations for the programme,

	Concerned about the fact that despite the repeated calls by the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council to upgrade the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch to a division, action has not been taken to give effect to Assembly resolutions 46/152, 47/91 of 16 December 1992 and 48/103, and Council resolutions 1992/22 of 30 July 1992, 1993/31 and 1993/34 of 27 July 1993 and 1994/16 of 25 July 1994,

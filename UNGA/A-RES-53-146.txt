	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Third Committee (A/53/625/Add.2)]


53/146.  Human rights and extreme poverty

    The General Assembly,

    Reaffirming the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,2 the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,2 and other human rights instruments adopted by the United Nations,

    Considering the relevant provisions of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993,3 and of the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development, adopted by the World Summit on 12 March 1995,4


    Recalling its resolutions 47/196 of 22 December 1992, by which it declared 17 October International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, 48/183 of 21 December 1993, by which it proclaimed 1996 International Year for the Eradication of Poverty, 50/107 of 20 December 1995, by which it proclaimed the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006), 51/97 of 12 December 1996 on human rights and extreme poverty and 52/193 of 18 December 1997, in which it emphasized the follow-up of the Decade,

    Recalling also its resolution 52/134 of 12 December 1997, in which it recognized that the enhancement of international cooperation in the field of human rights was essential for the understanding, promotion and protection of all human rights,

    Bearing in mind Commission on Human Rights resolutions 1992/11 of 21 February 1992,5 1993/13 of 26 February 1993,6 1994/12 of 25 February 1994,7 1995/16 of 24 February 1995,8 1996/10 of 11 April 1996,9 1997/11 of 3 April 199710 and 1998/25 of 17 April 1998,11 as well as resolution 1996/23 of 29 August 1996 of the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities of the Commission on Human Rights,12

    Recalling its resolution 47/134 of 18 December 1992, in which it reaffirmed that extreme poverty and exclusion from society constituted a violation of human dignity and stressed the need for a complete and in-depth study of extreme poverty, based on the experience and the thoughts of the poorest people,

    Recognizing that the eradication of extreme poverty is a major challenge within the process of globalization and requires coordinated and continued policies,

    Recognizing also that, as the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full and effective enjoyment of human rights and might, in some situations, constitute a threat to the right to life, its immediate alleviation and eventual elimination must remain a high priority for the international community,

    Welcoming the appointment, for a period of two years, of an independent expert on the question of human rights and extreme poverty, whose mandate includes, in particular, a contribution to the evaluation in the year 2000 of the World Summit for Social Development and whose work should continue to take into account the efforts of the poorest people themselves and the conditions in which they can convey their experiences,

    1.	Reaffirms that extreme poverty and exclusion from society constitute a violation of human dignity and that urgent national and international action is therefore required to eliminate them;


    2.	Also reaffirms that, in accordance with the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,3 it is essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the decision-making process in the communities in which they live, in the promotion of human rights and in efforts to combat extreme poverty;

    3.	Recognizes that surmounting extreme poverty constitutes an essential means to the full enjoyment of political, civil, economic, social and cultural rights, and reaffirms the interrelationship between these goals;

    4.	Emphasizes that extreme poverty is a major issue to be addressed by Governments, civil society and the United Nations system, including international financial institutions;

    5.	Invites the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, within the framework of the implementation of the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty, to continue to give appropriate attention to the question of human rights and extreme poverty;

    6.	Notes with appreciation the specific action taken by the United Nations Children's Fund to mitigate the effects of extreme poverty on children and the efforts of the United Nations Development Programme to give priority to the search for some means of alleviating poverty within the framework of the relevant resolutions, and urges them to continue this work;

    7.	Invites States, United Nations bodies, in particular the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Development Programme, and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to give appropriate attention to the links between human rights and extreme poverty;

    8.	Decides to consider this question further at its fifty-fifth session under the sub-item entitled "Human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms".

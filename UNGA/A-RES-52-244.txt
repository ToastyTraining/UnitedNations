52/244.Financing of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium and the Civilian Police Support Group


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium and the Civilian Police Support Group1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

	Recalling Security Council resolutions 1037 (1996) of 15 January 1996, by which the Council established the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium for an initial period of twelve months, and 1145 (1997) of 19 December 1997, by which the Council noted the termination of the Transitional Administration on 15 January 1998 and established the Civilian Police Support Group for a single period of up to nine months,

	Recalling also its decision 50/481 of 11 April 1996 on the financing of the Transitional Administration and its subsequent resolutions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 51/153 B of 13 June 1997,


	Reaffirming that the costs of the Transitional Administration are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Transitional Administration, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Transitional Administration,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the missions with the necessary financial resources to enable them to fulfil their responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium as at 15 May 1998, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 37.9 million United States dollars, representing 8 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Transitional Administration to the period ending 15 January 1998, notes that some 24 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

	4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Transitional Administration and the Civilian Police Support Group in full and on time;

	5.	Takes note of the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;2

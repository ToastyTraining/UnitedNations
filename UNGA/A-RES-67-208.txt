	Noting that the El Niño phenomenon has a recurring character and can lead to extensive natural hazards with the potential to seriously affect humankind, 
	Reaffirming the importance of developing strategies at the national, subregional, regional and international levels that aim to prevent, mitigate and repair the damage caused by natural disasters resulting from the El Niño phenomenon, 
	Noting that technological developments and international cooperation have enhanced the capabilities for the prediction of the El Niño phenomenon and thereby the potential for the preventive actions that may be taken to reduce its negative impacts, 
	Taking into account the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled "The future we want",1 the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development2 and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg Plan of Implementation),3 in particular paragraph 37 (i) thereof,
	Reaffirming the Hyogo Declaration4 and the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters,5 
	Acknowledging the importance of the ongoing efforts to mainstream disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation across sustainable development efforts, including taking into account the future impacts of El Niño in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation activities, 
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction,6 in particular the annex to the report, entitled "Update on international cooperation to reduce the impact of El Niño/
La Niña", and calls upon the international community to make further efforts to assist countries affected by this phenomenon; 
	2.	Recognizes the continued efforts being made by the Governments of Ecuador and Spain, the World Meteorological Organization and the inter-agency secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction to support the International Research Centre on El Niño at Guayaquil, Ecuador, and encourages them and other members of the international community to continue such contributions for the advancement of the Centre; 
	3.	Welcomes the activities undertaken so far to strengthen the International Research Centre on El Niño, through collaboration with international monitoring centres, including the national oceanographic institutions, and encourages further efforts to enhance regional and international recognition of and support for the Centre and to develop tools for decision makers and government authorities for reducing the impact of the El Niño phenomenon; 
	4.	Notes the contribution of the International Research Centre on El Niño as a reference centre on El Niño, including through developing a new climatic database for El Niño/Southern Oscillation-sensitive countries, carrying out applied research in climate change and vulnerability assessments in highlands, coastal zones and marine-protected and urban areas and providing professional training in the Americas, and encourages the sharing of best practices and lessons learned with climate centres located in other El Niño-affected regions; 
	5.	Recognizes the technical and scientific support of the World Meteorological Organization in producing regionally coordinated monthly and seasonal forecasts, in particular its establishment of a consensus mechanism for the development of updates on El Niño/La Niña conditions, which receives contributions from several climate centres, including the International Research Centre on El Niño;
	6.	Encourages the World Meteorological Organization, in this regard, to continue to strengthen collaboration and the exchange of data and information with relevant institutions; 
	7.	Calls upon the Secretary-General, the relevant United Nations organs, funds and programmes, in particular those taking part in the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, and the international community to adopt, as appropriate, the measures necessary to further strengthen the International Research Centre on El Niño, and invites the international community to provide scientific, technical and financial assistance and cooperation for this purpose, as well as to strengthen, as appropriate, other centres devoted to the study of the El Niño phenomenon; 
	8.	Underlines the importance of maintaining the El Niño/Southern Oscillation observation system, continuing research into extreme weather events, improving forecasting skills and developing appropriate policies for reducing the impact of the El Niño phenomenon and other extreme weather events, and emphasizes the need to further develop and strengthen these institutional capacities in all countries, in particular developing countries; 
	9.	Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, under the sub-item entitled "International Strategy for Disaster Reduction" of the item entitled "Sustainable development", a section on the implementation of the present resolution.

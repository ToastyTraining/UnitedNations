Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 5 December 2016 
[on the report of the First Committee (A/71/450)] 
71/64.	Consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 51/45 N of 10 December 1996, 52/38 G of 9 December 1997, 53/77 M of 4 December 1998, 54/54 H of 1 December 1999, 55/33 G of 20 November 2000, 56/24 P of 29 November 2001 and 57/81 of 22 November 2002, its decision 58/519 of 8 December 2003, as well as its resolutions 59/82 of 3 December 2004, 61/76 of 6 December 2006, 63/62 of 2 December 2008, 65/67 of 8 December 2010, 67/50 of 3 December 2012 and 69/60 of 2 December 2014, entitled "Consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures",
	Convinced that a comprehensive and integrated approach towards certain practical disarmament measures often is a prerequisite to maintaining and consolidating peace and security and thus provides a basis for effective post-conflict peacebuilding; such measures include collection and responsible disposal, preferably through destruction, of weapons obtained through illicit trafficking or illicit manufacture as well as of stockpiled weapons and ammunition declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements, particularly with regard to small arms and light weapons, unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered; confidence-building measures; disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants; demining; and conversion,
	Noting with satisfaction that the international community is more than ever aware of the importance of such practical disarmament measures, especially with regard to the growing problems arising from the excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons, including their ammunition, which pose a threat to peace and security and reduce the prospects for economic and social development in many regions, particularly in post-conflict situations,
	Stressing that further efforts are needed in order to develop and effectively implement programmes of practical disarmament in affected areas as part of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration measures so as to complement, on a case-by-case basis, peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts,
	Taking note of Security Council resolution 2171 (2014) of 21 August 2014, in which the Council affirmed that a comprehensive conflict prevention strategy should include practical disarmament and other measures to contribute to combating the proliferation and illicit trade of arms, 
	Welcoming the work of the United Nations Coordinating Action on Small Arms mechanism, which was established by the Secretary-General to bring about a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to the complex and multifaceted global problems related to small arms, 
	Welcoming also the report of the Sixth Biennial Meeting of States to Consider the Implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,1 which, inter alia, underlined the importance of the full and effective implementation of the Programme of Action2 and the International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons (the International Tracing Instrument)3 for attaining Goal 16 and target 16.4 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,4 and which noted the importance of arrangements that assist in matching needs and resources for the implementation of the Programme of Action and the International Tracing Instrument,
	Welcoming further the sustainable operation of the flexible, voluntary United Nations Trust Facility Supporting Cooperation on Arms Regulation, pursuant to the Programme of Action and the outcome of the Second United Nations Conference to Review Progress Made in the Implementation of the Programme of Action,5
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to resolution 69/60;6
	2.	Also takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects,7 which highlighted recent developments in small arms and light weapons manufacturing, technology and design and implications for the implementation of the International Instrument to Enable States to Identify and Trace, in a Timely and Reliable Manner, Illicit Small Arms and Light Weapons (the International Tracing Instrument);3 
	3.	Emphasizes the importance of including in United Nations-mandated peacekeeping missions, as appropriate and with the consent of the host State, practical disarmament measures aimed at addressing the illicit trafficking of small arms and light weapons, including through weapons collection, disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration programmes and enhancing physical security and stockpile management practices, as well as relevant training programmes, with a view to promoting and implementing an integrated comprehensive and effective weapons management strategy that would contribute to a sustainable peacebuilding process;
	4.	Welcomes the activities undertaken by the Group of Interested States for Practical Disarmament Measures, and invites the Group to continue to promote, on the basis of lessons learned from previous disarmament and peacebuilding projects, new practical disarmament measures to consolidate peace, especially as undertaken or designed by affected States themselves and regional and subregional organizations, as well as United Nations agencies;
	5.	Encourages the Group of Interested States to continue to function as an informal, open and transparent forum supporting the implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,2 in particular to facilitate the exchange of views on issues related to the United Nations small arms and light weapons process, as well as to continue efforts to facilitate the effective matching of assistance needs with available resources, in line with requests from affected States as indicated in their national reports, pursuant to the outcome of the Second United Nations Conference to Review Progress Made in the Implementation of the Programme of Action5 and the outcome of the Sixth Biennial Meeting of States to Consider the Implementation of the Programme of Action,8 thus effectively facilitating the provision of international assistance in the implementation of the Programme of Action; 
	6.	Also encourages the Group of Interested States to contribute to the development of voluntary indicators at the national level, based on the work of the Statistical Commission, the Programme of Action and the International Tracing Instrument, which could be used to measure progress made in the implementation of target 16.4,9 and to support efforts towards the implementation of the target, including data collection for relevant indicators;10
	7.	Encourages Member States in a position to do so to financially contribute to the United Nations Trust Facility Supporting Cooperation on Arms Regulation; 
	8.	Encourages States parties to the Arms Trade Treaty in a position to do so to financially contribute to the Arms Trade Treaty Voluntary Trust Fund;
	9.	Welcomes the synergies within the multi-stakeholder process, including Governments, the United Nations system, regional and subregional organizations and institutions as well as non-governmental organizations in support of practical disarmament measures and the Programme of Action;
	10.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its seventy-third session a report on the implementation of practical disarmament measures, taking into consideration the activities of the Group of Interested States;
	11.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-third session, under the item entitled "General and complete disarmament", the sub-item entitled "Consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures".

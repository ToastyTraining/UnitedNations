Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 18 April 2011
[without reference to a Main Committee (A/65/L.70 and Add.1)]
65/273.	Consolidating gains and accelerating efforts to control and eliminate malaria in developing countries, particularly in Africa, by 2015


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling that the period 2001-2010 was proclaimed the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa, by the General Assembly,1 and that combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases is included in the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, 
	Recalling also the malaria-related goals and commitments in the outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals,2 
	Recalling further its resolution 64/79 of 7 December 2009 and all previous resolutions concerning the struggle against malaria in developing countries, particularly in Africa,
	Recalling resolution 60.18, adopted by the World Health Assembly on 23 May 2007, urging a broad range of national and international actions to scale up malaria control programmes,3 and resolution 61.18 of 24 May 2008 on monitoring of the achievement of health-related Millennium Development Goals,4 
	Bearing in mind the relevant resolutions of the Economic and Social Council relating to the struggle against malaria and diarrhoeal diseases, in particular resolution 1998/36 of 30 July 1998,
	Taking note of all declarations and decisions on health issues, in particular those related to malaria, adopted by the Organization of African Unity and the African Union, including the Abuja call for accelerated action towards universal access to HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria services in Africa, issued by the Heads of State and Government of the African Union at the special summit of the African Union on HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, held in Abuja from 2 to 4 May 2006, and taking note of the decision adopted by the Assembly of the African Union at its fifteenth ordinary session, held in Kampala from 25 to 27 July 2010, to extend the Abuja call to 2015 to coincide with the Millennium Development Goals,5 
	Welcoming the leadership provided by the African Leaders Malaria Alliance and the continued commitment to help to achieve the 2015 targets, and encouraging them to continue to provide political leadership at the highest level in the fight against malaria in Africa, 
	Welcoming also the Secretary-General's Global Strategy for Women's and Children's Health, undertaken by a broad coalition of partners, in support of national plans and strategies, in order to significantly reduce the number of maternal, newborn and under-five child deaths as a matter of immediate concern by scaling up a priority package of high-impact interventions and integrating efforts in sectors such as health, education, gender equality, water and sanitation, poverty reduction and nutrition, 
	Recognizing the linkages in efforts being made to reach the targets set at the Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, held in Abuja on 24 and 25 April 2000, as necessary and important for the attainment of the "Roll Back Malaria" goal6 and the targets of the Millennium Development Goals by 2010 and 2015, respectively, and welcoming in this regard the commitment of Member States to respond to the specific needs of Africa, 
	Recognizing also that malaria-related ill health and deaths throughout the world can be substantially reduced with political commitment and commensurate resources if the public is educated and sensitized about malaria and appropriate health services are made available, particularly in countries where the disease is endemic,
	Recognizing further that malaria control interventions have a positive impact on overall child and maternal mortality rates and could help African countries to reach Millennium Development Goals 4 and 5 of reducing child mortality and improving maternal health, respectively, by 2015,
	Acknowledging the progress made in parts of Africa in reversing the high burden of malaria through political engagement and sustainable national malaria control programmes, as well as the progress being made towards achieving by 2015 the goals concerning malaria control set by the World Health Assembly and the Roll Back Malaria Partnership,
	Recognizing that, despite the fact that increased global and national investments in malaria control have yielded significant results in decreasing the burden of malaria in many countries, and that some countries are moving towards elimination of malaria, many countries continue to have unacceptably high burdens of malaria and in order to reach internationally agreed development goals, including the health-related Millennium Development Goals, must rapidly increase malaria prevention and control efforts, which rely heavily on medicines and insecticides whose utility is continuously threatened by the development of resistance in humans to antimalarial agents, as well as resistance of mosquitoes to insecticides,
	Recognizing also the challenges relating to counterfeit and substandard medicines, as well as poor malaria microscopy services, 
	Expressing concern about the continued morbidity, mortality and debility attributed to malaria, and recalling that more efforts are needed if the Abuja malaria targets and the malaria and Millennium Development Goal targets for 2015 are to be reached on time,
	Emphasizing the importance of strengthening health systems to effectively sustain malaria control and elimination,

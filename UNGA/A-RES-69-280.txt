	4.	Welcomes the launch of the United Nations flash appeal of 29 April 2015, and calls upon the international community, including Member States, to provide support during the three-month period of the flash appeal and beyond;
	5.	Emphasizes the importance of linking relief with rehabilitation and development from very early on, of building resilience and "building back better", of further strengthening national capacities at all levels, including effective and efficient governance and institutions, to prepare for and respond to future disasters of this kind, and of integrating a gender perspective, ensuring that women take an active and equal role in all relevant aspects related to disaster management and rehabilitation;

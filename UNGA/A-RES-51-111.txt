	Taking note with concern of the reports of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, which describe the continuing grave human rights situation in Kosovo, including in particular police brutality, killings resulting from such violence, arbitrary searches and arrests, torture and ill-treatment of detainees, the deliberate maltreatment, persecution and imprisonment of political and human rights activists, the mass dismissals of civil servants and discrimination against pupils and teachers, acts which are mainly perpetrated against ethnic Albanians,



	Welcoming, as a first step, the recent signature of a memorandum of understanding concerning the educational system in the Albanian language in Kosovo, and calling for the proper implementation of that memorandum,

	Recalling its resolution 50/190 of 22 December 1995 and other relevant resolutions, and taking note of the resolutions on the matter adopted by the Commission on Human Rights and the resolution adopted by the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities at its forty-eighth session,6 

	1.	Condemns all violations of human rights in Kosovo, in particular repression of the ethnic Albanian population and discrimination against them, as well as all acts of violence in Kosovo;

	2.	Demands that the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro):

	(a)	Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, in particular the discriminatory measures and practices, arbitrary searches and detention, the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and to revoke all discriminatory legislation, in particular that which has entered into force since 1989;

	(b)	Release all political prisoners and cease the persecution of political leaders and members of local human rights organizations;

	(c)	Allow the establishment of genuine democratic institutions in Kosovo, including the parliament and the judiciary, and respect the will of its inhabitants as the best means of preventing the escalation of the conflict there;

	(d)	Allow the reopening of educational, cultural and scientific institutions of the ethnic Albanians;

	(e)	Pursue constructive dialogue with the representatives of ethnic Albanians of Kosovo;

	3.	Welcomes the visits to Kosovo of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia and her relevant reports, and calls upon her to continue to monitor closely the human rights situation in Kosovo and to continue to pay due attention to this matter in her reporting;

	4.	Urges the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to allow the immediate unconditional return of the mission of long duration of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to Kosovo, called for in Security Council resolution 855 (1993)

of 9 August 1993;


	5.	Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to resolution 50/190,7 and requests him to continue his efforts to seek ways and means, including through consultations with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and relevant regional organizations, to establish an adequate international monitoring presence in Kosovo and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session;

	6.	Encourages the Secretary-General to pursue his humanitarian efforts in the former Yugoslavia, in liaison with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Children's Fund and other appropriate humanitarian organizations, with a view to taking urgent practical steps to tackle the critical needs of the people in Kosovo, especially of the most vulnerable groups affected by the conflict, and to assist in the voluntary return of displaced persons to their homes in conditions of safety and dignity;

	7.	Emphasizes the importance of laws and regulations concerning citizenship applied by the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) being in accordance with the standards and principles of non-discrimination, equal protection before the law and the reduction and avoidance of statelessness, as set out in the relevant international human rights instruments;

	8.	Decides to continue examination of the human rights situation in Kosovo at its fifty-second session under the item entitled "Human rights questions".

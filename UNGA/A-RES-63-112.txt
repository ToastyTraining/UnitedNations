	Recognizing that, in accordance with the Convention, the Agreement sets forth provisions concerning the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, including provisions on compliance and enforcement by the flag State and subregional and regional cooperation in enforcement, binding dispute settlement and the rights and obligations of States in authorizing the use of vessels flying their flags for fishing on the high seas, and specific provisions to address the requirements of developing States in relation to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks and the development of fisheries for such stocks, 
	Welcoming the fact that a growing number of States, and entities referred to in the Convention and in article 1, paragraph 2 (b), of the Agreement, as well as subregional and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, have taken measures, as appropriate, towards the implementation of the provisions of the Agreement, 
	Welcoming also the recent ratifications of and accessions to the Agreement,
	Welcoming further the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and its Committee on Fisheries and the 2005 Rome Declaration on Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, adopted by the Ministerial Meeting on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations on 12 March 2005,3 which calls for effective implementation of the various instruments already developed to ensure responsible fisheries, and recognizing that the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ("the Code")4 and its associated international plans of action set out principles and global standards of behaviour for responsible practices for conservation of fisheries resources and the management and development of fisheries, 
	Noting with concern that effective management of marine capture fisheries has been made difficult in some areas by unreliable information and data caused by unreported and misreported fish catch and fishing effort and that this lack of accurate data contributes to overfishing in some areas, 
	Recognizing the significant contribution of sustainable fisheries to food security, income, wealth and poverty alleviation for present and future generations, 
	Recognizing also the urgent need for action at all levels to ensure the long-term sustainable use and management of fisheries resources through the wide application of the precautionary approach, 
	Expressing concern over the current and projected adverse effects of climate change on food security and the sustainability of fisheries, and noting in that regard the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the United Nations Environment Programme, including the findings that climate change is likely to have substantial impacts on commercial and artisanal fisheries and food security,
	Noting the convening by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations of the Expert Workshop on Climate Change Implications for Fisheries and Aquaculture, in Rome from 7 to 9 April 2008, 
	Deploring the fact that fish stocks, including straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, in many parts of the world are overfished or subject to sparsely regulated and heavy fishing efforts, as a result of, inter alia, illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, inadequate flag State control and enforcement, including monitoring, control and surveillance measures, inadequate regulatory measures, harmful fisheries subsidies and overcapacity, and noting the report of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture 2006,5
	Noting the joint study by the World Bank and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform, and taking note of its conclusions, including that sustainable fisheries and reform of the global fisheries sector could generate additional economic growth and alternative livelihoods, and that reforms would need to include a reduction in fishing effort and fishing capacity, 
	Noting also the limited information available on measures taken by States to implement, individually and through regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, the International Plan of Action for the Management of Fishing Capacity adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,6 
	Particularly concerned that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing constitutes a serious threat to fish stocks and marine habitats and ecosystems, to the detriment of sustainable fisheries as well as the food security and the economies of many States, particularly developing States, 
	Concerned that some operators increasingly take advantage of the globalization of fishery markets to trade fishery products stemming from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and make economic profits from those operations, which constitutes an incentive for them to pursue their activities,
	Recognizing that effective deterrence and combating of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has significant financial and other resource implications,
	Recognizing also that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing may give rise to safety and security concerns for individuals on vessels engaged in such activities, 
	Welcoming cooperation between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the International Maritime Organization, in particular in assisting States and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities, 
	Recognizing the duty provided in the Convention, the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas ("the Compliance Agreement"),7 the Agreement and the Code for flag States to exercise effective control over fishing vessels flying their flag, and vessels flying their flag which provide support to fishing vessels, to ensure that the activities of such fishing and support vessels do not undermine the effectiveness of conservation and management measures taken in accordance with international law and adopted at the national, subregional, regional or global levels, 
	Recalling paragraphs 65 and 66 of its resolution 62/177, and noting in this regard the convening by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations of the Expert Consultation on the Development of a Comprehensive Global Record of Fishing Vessels, in Rome from 25 to 28 February 2008, and the findings of the Expert Consultation regarding the development of a comprehensive global record,8

	Calling attention to the need for States, individually and through regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, to continue to develop and implement effective port State measures and schemes to combat overfishing and illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, and the critical need for cooperation with developing States to build their capacity in this regard, taking note of the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations to develop a legally binding instrument on minimum standards for port State measures, 
	Noting that the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, the General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean, the North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission and the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization have adopted port State measures, to be applied by their members, which include prohibition of entry and use of port services, including landing and trans-shipment, to vessels identified by those regional fisheries management organizations as engaged in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing activities, and that those measures prevent and deter such activities,
	Concerned that marine pollution from all sources, including vessels and, in particular, land-based sources, constitutes a serious threat to human health and safety, endangers fish stocks, marine biodiversity and marine and coastal habitats and has significant costs to local and national economies, 
	Recognizing that marine debris is a global transboundary pollution problem and that, due to the many different types and sources of marine debris, different approaches to their prevention and removal are necessary, 
	Noting that the contribution of sustainable aquaculture to global fish supplies continues to respond to opportunities in developing countries to enhance local food security and poverty alleviation and, together with the efforts of other aquaculture producing countries, will make a significant contribution to meeting future demands in fish consumption, bearing in mind article 9 of the Code, and therefore welcoming the adoption in 2007 of the Strategy and Outline Plan for Improving Information on Status and Trends of Aquaculture by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations9 to improve knowledge and understanding of the status and trends of aquaculture,
	Calling attention to the circumstances affecting fisheries in many developing States, in particular African States and small island developing States, and recognizing the urgent need for capacity-building, including the transfer of marine technology and in particular fisheries-related technology, to enhance the ability of such States to meet their obligations and exercise their rights under international instruments, in order to realize the benefits from fisheries resources, 
	Recognizing the need for appropriate measures to minimize by-catch, waste, discards, including high-grading, loss of fishing gear and other factors, which adversely affect fish stocks and may also have undesirable effects on the economies and food security of small island developing States, other developing coastal States, and subsistence fishing communities,
	Recognizing also the need to further integrate ecosystem approaches into fisheries conservation and management and, more generally, the importance of applying ecosystem approaches to the management of human activities in the ocean, and noting in this regard the Reykjavik Declaration on Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem,10 the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations related to guidelines for the implementation of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management and the importance of this approach to relevant provisions of the Agreement and the Code, as well as decision VII/1111 and other relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, 
	Recognizing further the economic and cultural importance of sharks in many countries, the biological importance of sharks in the marine ecosystem as key predatory species, the vulnerability of certain shark species to overexploitation, the fact that some are threatened with extinction, the need for measures to promote the long-term conservation, management and sustainable use of shark populations and fisheries, and the relevance of the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 1999,6 in providing guidance on the development of such measures, 
	Reaffirming its support for the initiative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and relevant subregional and regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements on the conservation and management of sharks, while noting with concern that basic data on shark stocks and harvests continue to be lacking, that only a small number of countries have implemented the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, and that not all regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements have adopted conservation and management measures for directed shark fisheries,
	Expressing concern that the practice of large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing remains a threat to marine living resources, and emphasizing that efforts should be made to ensure that the implementation of resolution 46/215 in some parts of the world does not result in the transfer to other parts of the world of drift nets that contravene the resolution, 
	Expressing concern also over reports of continued losses of seabirds, particularly albatrosses and petrels, as well as other marine species, including sharks, fin-fish species and marine turtles, as a result of incidental mortality in fishing operations, particularly longline fishing, and other activities, while recognizing considerable efforts to reduce by-catch in longline fishing by States and through various regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements, 
	Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General,12 in particular its useful role in gathering and disseminating information on practices relating to the sustainable development of the world's living marine resources,

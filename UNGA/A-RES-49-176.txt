	2.	Appeals to all Governments, organizations and individuals in a position to do so to respond favourably to requests for contributions to the Fund, if possible on a regular basis and annually before the meeting of the Board of Trustees of the Fund and if possible also with a substantial increase in the number and level of contributions so that consideration may be given to the ever-increasing demand for assistance;

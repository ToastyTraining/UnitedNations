	Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General on disarmament and non-proliferation education,1 in which the Secretary-General reported on the implementation of the recommendations contained in the United Nations study on disarmament and non-proliferation education,2 and recalling that 2016 marks the fourteenth anniversary of that report,
	Recognizing the usefulness of the disarmament and non-proliferation education website "Disarmament education: resources for learning", which is updated on a regular basis by the Office for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat, including to provide information in all its sections, such as presentations, interviews in the "Disarmament today" series of podcasts, which include the experiences of the hibakusha, the atomic bomb survivors, films and publications on disarmament issues, and encouraging the use of new communications technologies and social media for the promotion of disarmament and non-proliferation education,
	Emphasizing that the Secretary-General concludes in his report that efforts need to be continued to implement the recommendations of the study and follow the good examples of how they are being implemented to stimulate even further long-term results,
	Desirous of stressing the urgency of promoting concerted international efforts at disarmament and non-proliferation, in particular in the field of nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation, with a view to strengthening international security and enhancing sustainable economic and social development,
	Conscious of the need to combat the negative effects of cultures of violence and complacency in the face of current dangers in this field through long-term programmes of education and training,
	Remaining convinced that the need for disarmament and non-proliferation education, particularly among youth, has never been greater, not only on the subject of weapons of mass destruction but also in the field of small arms and light weapons, terrorism and other challenges to international security and the process of disarmament, as well as on the relevance of implementing the recommendations contained in the United Nations study,
	Recognizing the importance of the participation of civil society, including academic and non-governmental organizations, which plays an active role in the promotion of disarmament and non-proliferation education,
	1.	Expresses its appreciation to the Member States, the United Nations and other international and regional organizations, civil society and academic and non-governmental organizations, which, within their purview, implemented the recommendations made in the United Nations study,2 as discussed in the report of the Secretary-General reviewing the implementation of the recommendations,1 and encourages them once again to continue to apply those recommendations and report to the Secretary-General on steps taken to implement them;
	2.	Requests the Secretary-General to prepare a report reviewing the results of the implementation of the recommendations and possible new opportunities for promoting disarmament and non-proliferation education, and to submit it to the General Assembly at its seventy-third session;
	3.	Reiterates the request to the Secretary-General to utilize electronic means to the fullest extent possible in the dissemination, in as many official languages as feasible, of information related to that report and any other information that the Office for Disarmament Affairs gathers on an ongoing basis with regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the United Nations study;
	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to maintain updated the website "Disarmament education: resources for learning", including the "Disarmament today" series of podcasts, as an efficient and effective tool to promote disarmament and non-proliferation education;
	5.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-third session, under the item entitled "General and complete disarmament", the sub-item entitled "Disarmament and non-proliferation education".

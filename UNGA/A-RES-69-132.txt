	Noting the role of the Foreign Policy and Global Health Initiative in promoting synergy between foreign policy and global health and that health inequities within and between countries cannot only be addressed within the health sector by technical measures, or only at the national level, but also require global engagement for health, which is rooted in global solidarity and shared responsibility,

	Taking note of multisectoral efforts, including the Global Health Security Agenda, to strenghten global capacity to prevent, detect and respond to infectious diseases, in particular by promoting sustainable and resilient national health systems, surveillance systems and response protocols,

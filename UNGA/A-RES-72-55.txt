Encourages States wishing to improve their national ammunition stockpile management capacity, wishing to prevent the growth of conventional ammunition surpluses and wishing to implement wider risk mitigation to contact the SaferGuard programme, as well as potential national donors, regional organizations or other organizations, as appropriate;

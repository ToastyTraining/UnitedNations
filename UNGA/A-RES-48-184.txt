	Recognizing the central role that women play in the eradication of poverty and the necessity of addressing the needs of women in poverty eradication programmes,

	2.	Reaffirms that a supportive international economic environment which takes into account resource flows and structural adjustment programmes, in which social and environmental dimensions are integrated, is vital to the success of efforts of developing countries, in particular, to deal with the eradication of poverty;

	3.	Invites all countries to undertake national strategies and programmes for the eradication of poverty that are, inter alia, sensitive to gender considerations, taking into account cultural, religious and social particularities, and that involve more active participation by the targeted communities, as well as by the most vulnerable groups, in initiating, implementing, following up and evaluating specific projects;

	5.	Invites the international community and the organs, organizations and bodies of the United Nations system to continue to support development programmes in developing countries, including the implementation of the decisions and recommendations of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development related to the eradication of poverty, particularly chapter 3 of Agenda 21 2/ entitled "Combating poverty";

	8.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session an updated report focusing, inter alia, on the development of appropriate inputs to country programmes by relevant agencies and organizations of the United Nations system, based on exchange of information on and analysis of the operations of actual programmes and on the identification of constraints and weaknesses of operational and coordinating capacities owing to a lack of resources, as well as focusing on elements for the elaboration of multisectoral strategies;

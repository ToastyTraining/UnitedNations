	The General Assembly,
	Recalling that the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco)1 was opened for signature at Mexico City on 14 February 1967,
	Recalling also that, in its preamble, the Treaty of Tlatelolco states that military denuclearized zones are not an end in themselves but rather a means for achieving general and complete disarmament at a later stage, 
	Recalling further that, in its resolution 2286 (XXII) of 5 December 1967, it welcomed with special satisfaction the Treaty of Tlatelolco as an event of historic significance in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to promote international peace and security, 
	Recalling that in 1990, 1991 and 1992 the General Conference of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean approved and opened for signature a set of amendments to the Treaty of Tlatelolco,2 with the aim of enabling the full entry into force of that instrument,
	Highlighting the fact that the Treaty of Tlatelolco, which is in force for thirty-three sovereign States of the region, consolidated the first nuclear-weapon-free zone established in a densely populated region,
	Recognizing the important contribution of the treaties of Tlatelolco, Rarotonga,3 Bangkok4 and Pelindaba5 and the Treaty on a Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone in Central Asia, as well as the Antarctic Treaty6 and the declaration by Mongolia of its nuclear-weapon-free status, to the achievement of nuclear non-proliferation and nuclear disarmament,
	Recalling all relevant United Nations resolutions in support of nuclear-weapon-free zones, 
	Welcoming the holding of the Second Conference of States Parties and Signatories to Treaties that Establish Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones and Mongolia, held in New York on 30 April 2010, as an important contribution to achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world,
	Noting that the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in its final document,7 encouraged the establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones and the fostering of cooperation and enhanced consultation mechanisms among the existing nuclear-weapon-free zones through the establishment of concrete measures, in order to fully implement the principles and objectives of the relevant nuclear-weapon-free zone treaties, and commending the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean for its leadership in this endeavour, 
	Reaffirming the importance of the Agency as the appropriate legal and political forum for ensuring full compliance with and implementation of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, as well as cooperation with the entities of other nuclear-weapon-free zones,
	1.	Welcomes the fact that the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco)1 is in force for the sovereign States of the region; 
	2.	Urges the countries of the region that have not yet done so to sign or deposit their instruments of ratification of the amendments to the Treaty of Tlatelolco approved by the General Conference of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean in its resolutions 267 (E-V), 268 (XII) and 290 (VII); 
	3.	Encourages States that have ratified the relevant Protocols to the Treaty of Tlatelolco to review any reservations in this regard, in accordance with action 9 of the Final Document of the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons;8

	5.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-eighth session the item entitled "Consolidation of the regime established by the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco)".

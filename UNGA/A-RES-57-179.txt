	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming the obligation of all States to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to life, liberty and security of person, as stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 and reaffirming also the obligations of States parties under human rights instruments, in particular the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,2 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,2 the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women3 and the Convention on the Rights of the Child,4

	Bearing in mind that crimes against women committed in the name of honour are a human rights issue and that States have an obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and punish the perpetrators of such crimes and to provide protection to the victims, and that not doing so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms,

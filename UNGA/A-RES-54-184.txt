    Reaffirming the obligations of all Member States under the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,2 the obligations of States parties under the International Covenants on Human Rights3 and all other human rights instruments and the obligation of all to respect international humanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 for the protection of victims of war4 and the Additional Protocols thereto, of 1977,5 as well as the principles and commitments undertaken by participating States of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,

    Reaffirming also the territorial integrity of all States in the region, within their internationally recognized borders, taking fully into account all relevant Security Council resolutions,

    Expressing its full support for the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the annexes thereto (collectively the "Peace Agreement"),6 which, inter alia, committed the parties of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to respect human rights fully, and for the Basic Agreement on the Region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (the "Basic Agreement"),7

    Expressing its deep concern at the continuing evidence of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms taking place to varying degrees in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and, in particular, the failure of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to follow the recommendations made in 1996 by the personal representative of the Chairman-in-Office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe,

    Welcoming all contributions of the Office of the High Representative, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other parts of the United Nations, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the Council of Europe, the European Community Monitoring Mission, Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations in the area in 1999,

    1.	Reiterates its call for the full and consistent implementation of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the annexes thereto (collectively the "Peace Agreement")6 and the Basic Agreement on the Region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium (the "Basic Agreement")7 by all parties to those agreements;

    2.	Stresses the crucial role of human rights in the successful implementation of the Peace Agreement, and underlines the obligations of the parties under the Peace Agreement to secure for all persons within their jurisdiction the highest level of international norms and standards of human rights and fundamental freedoms;


    3.	Also stresses the need to direct international human rights efforts in the region to the core issues of the lack of full respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all individuals without distinction, the rule of law and effective administration of justice at all levels of government, the freedom and independence of the media, freedom of expression, freedom of association, including with respect to political parties, freedom of religion and freedom of movement;

    4.	Further stresses the need for enhanced international human rights efforts to foster and effect the prompt and voluntary return of displaced persons and refugees in safety and with dignity;

    5.	Reiterates its call upon all parties and States in the region to ensure that the promotion and protection of human rights and effective, functioning democratic institutions will be central elements in developing civilian structures, as reaffirmed at the meetings of the Steering Board of the Peace Implementation Council and the Peace Implementation Conference;

    6.	Urges all States and parties to the Peace Agreement that have not done so to meet their obligations to cooperate fully with the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, as required by Security Council resolution 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993 and all subsequent relevant resolutions, and, in particular, to comply with their obligations to arrest and transfer to the custody of the Tribunal those indicted persons present in their territories or in territories under their control;

    7.	Continues to call upon all parties to the Peace Agreement to take immediate steps to determine the identity, whereabouts and fate of missing persons in their territories, including through close cooperation with the United Nations as well as with humanitarian organizations and independent experts, and stresses the importance of coordination in this area;

    8.	Notes that varying degrees of progress have been made in the human rights situation in several areas, but that substantial efforts remain to be made;


I.  BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA

    9.	Notes the progress made in Bosnia and Herzegovina with regard to the increase in political pluralism and freedom of expression, through the participation of all groups and individuals, which represents another step towards democracy in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but remains concerned that freedom of speech and the media are still curtailed by political influence, notably through the selective and intimidating application of slander laws;

    10.	Expresses its continued serious concern about continuing human rights violations within Bosnia and Herzegovina and delays in the full implementation of the human rights provisions of the Peace Agreement, notably the delay in bringing legislation into compliance with the human rights provisions of the national Constitution of the country, and the failure of local authorities and groups to comply with the obligations of the Peace Agreement;

    11.	Condemns in the strongest terms the complicity by local governments in the perpetration of violence against minority refugees and internally displaced persons returning to their homes and in the destruction of their homes, including acts of intimidation and all those acts designed to discourage the voluntary return of refugees and internally displaced persons, and calls for the removal from office of implicated local government officials as well as the immediate arrest and bringing to justice of those responsible for such acts;

    14.	Notes with satisfaction the decline in violence against returning refugees and displaced persons, while remaining concerned that all ethnic groups continue to report harassment;

    15.	Welcomes the adoption of a new criminal code and of codes of ethics by the judges and prosecutors of both entities and the increased strength of the prosecutor's office of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina as a result of laws imposed by the High Representative, but notes that the judicial processes still do not sufficiently protect the rights of the accused;

    16.	Notes that implementation of the decisions of the Human Rights Chamber has begun, while reminding both State- and entity-level governments to pay increased attention to decisions of the Chamber;

    17.	Calls upon the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina and, in particular, the authorities of the Republika Srpska to increase their cooperation with the Commission on Human Rights for Bosnia and Herzegovina, to cooperate fully with the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and to intensify their efforts in this regard;

    18.	Notes that police standards and protection have improved, while remaining concerned about continuing indications among the police of unprofessional conduct, political influence and instances of interference with the return of refugees and the use of excessive force;

    19.	Urges the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina, in particular those of the Republika Srpska, to ensure full and free access to their territories for all institutions and organizations concerned with the implementation of the present resolution, including non-governmental organizations, and to provide for the protection of those organizations, especially those providing humanitarian assistance;

    20.	Stresses the importance of the implementation of the programme proposed by the High Representative in coordination with the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Council of Europe and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe for a comprehensive judicial reform;

    22.	Calls upon the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina urgently to consider, with a view to its early adoption and full implementation, the draft permanent election law designed by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to strengthen ties between constituents and representatives, strengthen democratic accountability and encourage pluralistic, multi-ethnic political parties;


    23.	Notes the importance of the work of the Human Rights Ombudsman in bringing to light many cases of human rights violations and in resolving several of them, and urges the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to implement the recommendations of the Ombudsman;

    24.	Condemns recurrent instances of religious discrimination and violence and the denial to religious minorities of their rights to reclaim and rebuild their religious sites;

    25.	Expresses its concern that trafficking in women is a growing problem, and calls upon the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to act vigorously to combat this problem;


II.  REPUBLIC OF CROATIA

    26.	Notes with interest the initiatives taken by the Republic of Croatia to improve the legislative and economic framework for the return of refugees, in particular steps to eliminate discriminatory provisions of Croatian laws;

    27.	Notes with satisfaction the cooperation between the Police Monitoring Group of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe and the local police forces in Eastern Slavonia, while also noting continued instances of ethnically based problems in Eastern Slavonia;

    28.	Welcomes the continuing efforts by the Republic of Croatia to train and to guarantee the professionalism and impartiality of the Croatian police and military forces, and notes, in particular, the commitment on the part of the Ministry of the Interior to maintain an ethnically diverse police force in the Danube region;

    29.	Also welcomes the actions of the Government of the Republic of Croatia related to the return of significant numbers of persons to their places of origin since 1995 and the steps being taken by the Government to eliminate discriminatory provisions of Croatian laws, while noting that the pace of minority returns from third countries has been disappointing, and expresses concern that protection of the rights of persons belonging to minorities has not met the level of Croatia's legal obligations;

    30.	Notes that the Government of the Republic of Croatia has continued its efforts to codify democratic norms, including the independence of its judiciary and freedom of association and assembly, while also noting that the application by the Government of those laws and principles has lagged behind its stated intentions;

    31.	Expresses deep concern about the fact that commitments by the Government to improve the freedom of the press have remained unfulfilled, and reaffirms the need for free and independent media and the need to provide to all political parties equal access to all forms of media during the forthcoming electoral campaign;

    32.	Notes the passage of a new telecommunications law as a positive step, but urges the Government of the Republic of Croatia to comply with international recommendations, in particular those of the mission of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe in the areas of electoral and media reform, regrets that until now those recommendations have been only partially fulfilled, and stresses the importance of the full application of the citizenship law of 1991;


    33.	Expresses deep concern about the reported extensive campaign of wiretapping against the independent media and opposition political figures, and calls upon the Government of the Republic of Croatia to ensure that the media and opposition political figures and parties are not harassed or hindered in their actions or intimidated by actions of the Government and are guaranteed the same protections as representatives of the media or political establishment who are favourable to the Government;

    34.	Welcomes the signing on 10 May 1999 by the Government of the Republic of Croatia of the programme of technical assistance of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, with a view to building national human rights capacity and human rights education, and looks forward to the implementation of the programme in December 1999;

    35.	Notes the efforts of the Republic of Croatia to codify and incorporate the impartial application of the law, but urges the swift and complete implementation of judicial decisions for all citizens, irrespective of ethnicity, religion or political affiliation, while noting with concern that due process, the rule of law, the treatment of ethnic minorities and press freedoms fall short of the standards of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, notably that lengthy judicial processes plague the Croatian judiciary and that cases of interest to the ruling party are processed more expeditiously than others;

    36.	Also notes the formal steps taken by the Republic of Croatia to guarantee the rights of persons belonging to minorities and the ratification of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities8 and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages,9 but continues to remind the Government of its primary responsibility to restore the multi-ethnic character of Croatia, in fact as well as in law, including the pledge to guarantee the representation of national minorities, including Serbs, at various levels of local, regional and national government;

    37.	Further notes outstanding letters from the President of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991 to the Security Council, and calls upon the Republic of Croatia to cooperate fully with the Tribunal and to comply, in particular, with its obligation to arrest and transfer to the custody of the Tribunal those indicted persons known to be present in its territory and, when prosecuting war crimes, to ensure that domestic prosecution complies with international standards and the obligations of the Republic of Croatia to the Tribunal;


III.  FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA (SERBIA AND MONTENEGRO)

    39.	Calls upon the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and all authorities and representatives of ethnic groups in Kosovo to implement Security Council resolution 1244 (1999) of 10 June 1999 and consequently to cooperate fully with and support the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo in the fulfilment of its mandate;

    40.

    41.	Demands that the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) hand over to the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia all government officials of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and of the Government of the Republic of Serbia indicted as war criminals and repudiate the leadership of anyone so indicted as a first step towards establishing a democratic government and becoming a full and respected member of the international community, and reminds the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) of its obligations to cooperate fully with the Tribunal;

    44.	Demands that the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) institutionalize democratic norms by holding free and fair elections at all levels of government, respecting the rule of law and the administration of justice and fully respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms;

    49.	Insists that the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) support the activities of the international community and the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo to rebuild and facilitate the multi-ethnic society in Kosovo that the policy of ethnic cleansing, intimidation and discrimination largely destroyed, in particular by using the influence of the Government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) among the local Serb representatives in Kosovo and by working in good faith with the local Albanian representatives to that end;

    50.	Calls upon the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) to implement fully, with dispatch and in good faith, their obligations under the Peace Agreement, notably to cooperate fully with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian organizations to alleviate the suffering of refugees and internally displaced persons and to assist in their safe and voluntary return to their homes;

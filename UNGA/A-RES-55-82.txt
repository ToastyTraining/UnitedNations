Resolution adopted by the General Assembly

[on the report of the Third Committee (A/55/600)]
55/82.	Measures to be taken against political platforms and activities based on doctrines of superiority which are based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and xenophobia, including, in particular, neo-Nazism


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling that the United Nations emerged from the struggle against nazism, fascism, aggression and foreign occupation, and that the people expressed their resolve in the Charter of the United Nations to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,
	Aware of the determination proclaimed by the peoples of the world in the Charter to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,
	Convinced that any doctrine of superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous, and that there is no justification for racial discrimination, in theory or in practice, anywhere,
	Noting with appreciation the efforts undertaken by various regional organizations against political platforms and activities based on doctrines of superiority which are based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and xenophobia, including, in particular, neo-Nazism,
	Noting with regret that in the contemporary world there continue to exist various manifestations of neo-Nazi activities, as well as other political platforms and activities based on doctrines of superiority which are based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and xenophobia, which entail contempt for the individual or a denial of the intrinsic dignity and equality of all human beings and of equality of opportunity in the civil, political, economic and social and cultural spheres and in social justice,
	Deeply alarmed at the recent intensification of activities of neo-Nazi groups and organizations,
	Noting with concern the widening use by such groups and organizations of the opportunities provided by scientific and technological progress, including the Internet global computer network, to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world,
	Noting that the use of such technologies can also contribute to combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,
	Expressing its serious concern at the rise in many parts of the world of doctrines based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and at the growing coordination of activities based on such doctrines in society at large,
	Recalling its resolutions 2331 (XXII) of 18 December 1967, 2545 (XXIV) of 11 December 1969, 35/200 of 15 December 1980, 36/162 of 16 December 1981, 37/179 of 17 December 1982, 38/99 of 16 December 1983, 39/114 of 14 December 1984, 41/160 of 4 December 1986 and 43/150 of 8 December 1988,
	Recalling also Commission on Human Rights resolutions 1983/28 of 7 March 1983,1 1984/42 of 12 March 1984,2  1985/31 of 13 March 1985,3 1986/61 of 13 March 1986,4 1988/63 of 10 March 19885 and 1990/46 of 6 March 1990,6
	Taking into consideration the report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,7
	Welcoming the convening of the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance in Durban, South Africa, from 31 August to 7 September 2001,
	1.	Again resolutely condemns political platforms and activities based on doctrines of superiority which are based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and xenophobia, including, in particular, neo-Nazism, which entail abuse of human rights and fundamental freedoms;
	2.	Expresses its determination to resist such political platforms and activities which can undermine the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and of equality of opportunity;
	3.	Urges States to take all available measures in accordance with their obligations under international human rights instruments to combat political platforms and activities based on doctrines of superiority which are based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and xenophobia, including, in particular, neo-Nazism;
	4.	Calls upon all Governments to promote and encourage, especially among young people, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as to promote awareness of and oppose political platforms and activities based on doctrines of superiority which are based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and xenophobia, including, in particular, neo-Nazism;
	5.	Urges all States to consider the adoption, as a matter of high priority, of appropriate measures to eradicate activities that lead to violence and condemn any dissemination of ideas based on doctrines of superiority which are based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and xenophobia, including, in particular, neo-Nazism, consistent with their national legal systems and in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,8 the International Covenants on Human Rights9 and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination;10
	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance information on the measures taken by Member States against political platforms and activities based on doctrines of superiority which are based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and xenophobia, including, in particular, neo-Nazism.

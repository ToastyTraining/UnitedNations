[without reference to a Main Committee (A/68/L.26 and Add.1)]
68/98.	Global health and foreign policy


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 63/33 of 26 November 2008, 64/108 of 10 December 2009, 65/95 of 9 December 2010, 66/115 of 12 December 2011 and 67/81 of 12 December 2012,
	Welcoming the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits which have contributed to the advancement of the global health agenda, including the 2013 outcome document of the special event to follow up efforts made towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals,1 the 2013 outcome document of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the realization of the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities: the way forward, a disability-inclusive development agenda towards 2015 and beyond,2 the 2012 outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled "The future we want",3 the Rio Political Declaration on Social Determinants of Health adopted at the 2011 World Conference on Social Determinants of Health, the 2011 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying Our Efforts to Eliminate HIV and AIDS,4 the 2011 political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases,5 World Health Assembly resolution 66.11 of 27 May 2013 on health in the post-2015 development agenda, the Helsinki Statement on Health in All Policies, adopted at the Eighth Global Conference on Health Promotion, and Recommendation No. 202 concerning national floors of social protection, adopted by the International Labour Conference at its 101st session, and reaffirming the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, adopted in Cairo in September 1994,6 the key actions for the further implementation of the Programme of Action7 and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action,8
	Welcoming also the adoption of Economic and Social Council resolution 2013/12 of 22 July 2013 on the United Nations Inter-Agency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of Non-communicable Diseases,
	Reaffirming the right of every human being, without distinction of any kind, to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health and to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of oneself and one's family, including adequate food, clothing and housing, and to the continuous improvement of living conditions,
	Noting with particular concern that, for millions of people, the right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including access to quality medicines, remains a distant goal, that, especially for women, the most vulnerable, children and those living in poverty, the likelihood of achieving this goal is becoming increasingly remote, that millions of people are driven below the poverty line each year because of catastrophic out-of-pocket payments for health care and that excessive out-of-pocket payments can discourage the impoverished from seeking or continuing care,
	Reaffirming the right to use, to the fullest extent, the provisions contained in the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement), the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health, the decision of the General Council of the World Trade Organization of 30 August 2003 on the implementation of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health and, when formal acceptance procedures are completed, the amendment to article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement, as proposed by the General Council of the World Trade Organization in its decision of 6 December 2005, which provide flexibilities for the protection of public health, and in particular to promote access to medicines for all, and to encourage the provision of assistance to developing countries in this regard, and calling for broad and timely acceptance of the amendment to article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement,
	Recognizing that the protection of intellectual property can be important in the development of new medicines,
	Recognizing also that health is a precondition for and an outcome and indicator of all three dimensions of sustainable development and that, despite progress made, challenges in global health, including major inequities and vulnerabilities within and among countries, regions and populations, still remain and demand persistent attention,
	Reaffirming the commitment to the achievement of all the Millennium Development Goals, and stressing the need to further support initiatives aimed at accelerating progress for their achievement by 2015,
	Welcoming progress made in the areas of the Millennium Development Goals on health, which are key to achieving all the Goals, and noting that the Goals are interconnected and that progress in the achievement of any of the Goals bolsters progress in others, noting with concern in this regard the remaining gap between the commitment and delivery on Goal 8, and stressing that more needs to be done to achieve the Goals by 2015,
	Noting the important role that partnerships with a broad range of actors, including national Governments, local authorities, international institutions, business, civil society organizations, foundations, philanthropists and social impact investors, scientists and academics, and individuals, play in development,
	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General entitled "A life of dignity for all: accelerating progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and advancing the United Nations development agenda beyond 2015",9
	Acknowledging the efforts made by Member States to finance and strengthen their health systems, supported by international cooperation, to achieve health goals, to make progress towards universal access to health services and to address health challenges, including communicable and non-communicable diseases, as well as their underlying determinants, which are associated with social, economic and environmental conditions,
	Acknowledging also that the promotion of health equity is essential to sustainable development and to a better quality of life and well-being for all, which, in turn, can contribute to peace and security, and that health equity is a shared goal and responsibility and requires the engagement of all sectors of government, all segments of society and all members of the international community,
	Recognizing the link between moving towards universal health coverage and many other foreign policy issues, such as the social dimension of globalization, cohesion and stability, inclusive and equitable growth and sustainable development and sustainability of national financing mechanisms in this regard,
	Underscoring the need for partnerships for global health to ensure the promotion of effective implementation of universal health coverage on the basis of solidarity, at the national and international levels,
	Underscoring also the need for far-reaching partnerships for global health to support the promotion of, inter alia, gender equality and women's empowerment, sexual and reproductive health and women's and girls' full enjoyment of all their human rights, so as to contribute to the eradication of poverty and to economic and social development, including improved health outcomes,
	Noting the role of the Foreign Policy and Global Health Initiative in promoting synergy between foreign policy and global health, as well as the contribution of the Oslo Ministerial Declaration of 20 March 2007, entitled "Global health: a pressing foreign policy issue of our time",10 which was reaffirmed, with renewed actions and commitments, by the ministerial communiqué of 23 September 2013,

Urges Member States to honour their commitments towards agreed health targets and goals and to sustain and accelerate efforts towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, particularly the health-related Goals, noting in particular the relevance of, inter alia, the 2011 Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying Our Efforts to Eliminate HIV and AIDS,4 the 2011 political declaration of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases,5 the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, adopted in Cairo in September 1994,6 the key actions for the further implementation of the Programme of Action7 and the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action;8

	Mindful of the important role of the United Nations and of the United Nations Children's Fund in promoting the well-being of children and their development,

	Recalling the recommendation in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, 3/ adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights at Vienna in June 1993, that measures be taken to achieve by 1995 universal ratification of the Convention, and the universal signing of the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children 4/and Plan of Action for Implementing the World Declaration on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children in the 1990s, 4/ adopted by the World Summit for Children in New York in September 1990, as well as their effective implementation,

	Seriously concerned about those reservations to the Convention that are contrary to the object and purpose of the Convention or otherwise contrary to international treaty law, and recalling that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action urges States to withdraw such reservations,

	12.	Expresses concern at the increasingly heavy workload of the Committee on the Rights of the Child and the resulting difficulties it faces in the fulfilment of its functions;

	13.	Approves the recommendation contained in the resolution adopted by consensus at the meeting of the States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 10 October 1994, in which the States parties reaffirmed the recommendation made by the Committee on the Rights of the Child regarding the increase to three of the number of annual sessions of the Committee as from 1995, as well as the number of sessions of the pre-sessional working group;

	14.	Authorizes the Secretary-General to implement that recommendation;

	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming the obligations of all States to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms as stated in the Charter of the United Nations, and guided by the purposes and principles of human rights instruments, 
	Reaffirming also the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 which states that everyone has the right to take part in the government of his or her country and the right of equal access to public service,
	Recalling the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,2 which states, inter alia, that every citizen shall have the right and opportunity to take part in the conduct of public affairs, directly or through freely chosen representatives, to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections and to have access, on general terms of equality, to public service in his or her country,
	Recalling also the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,3 which states, inter alia, that States parties shall take all appropriate measures to eliminate discrimination against women in the political and public life of the country,
	Recalling further the Convention on the Political Rights of Women,4 which states that women shall be, on equal terms with men and without any discrimination, entitled to vote in all elections, eligible for election to all publicly elected bodies established by national law and entitled to hold public office and to exercise all public functions established by national law,
	Recalling the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action,5 the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century",6 the United Nations Millennium Declaration7 and agreed conclusions 1997/2 on women in power and decision-making, adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women on 21 March 1997,8
	Affirming that the empowerment and autonomy of women and the improvement of their political, social and economic status are essential to the achievement of representative, transparent and accountable government, democratic institutions and sustainable development in all areas of life,
	Affirming also that the active participation of women, on equal terms with men, at all levels of decision-making is essential to the achievement of equality, sustainable development, peace and democracy,
	Concerned that, despite general acceptance of the need for gender balance in decision-making bodies at all levels, women are still largely underrepresented at most levels of government, especially in ministerial and other executive bodies, and in legislative bodies,
	Recognizing that women have demonstrated considerable leadership in community and informal organizations, as well as in public office,
	Recognizing also that women's full and equal participation in the political process and decision-making will provide a balance that more accurately reflects the composition of society, is needed to strengthen democracy and promote its proper functioning, plays a pivotal role in furthering women's equal status, including improving women's socio-economic status, and contributes to redefining political priorities and providing new perspectives on political issues,
	Recognizing further that women's participation in decision-making and in political, civil, economic, social and cultural life is negatively affected by poverty, which disproportionately affects women, particularly in developing countries,
	Reaffirming the important role of women in the prevention and resolution of conflicts and in peace-building, and stressing the importance of their full and equal participation in all efforts to maintain and promote peace and security and the need to increase their role in decision-making with regard to conflict prevention and resolution and the rebuilding of post-conflict society, in accordance with Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 and the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly,
	Recognizing the importance of education and training from an early age in government, public policy, economics, civics, information technology and science to ensure that women develop the knowledge, skills, confidence and ethical values needed to participate fully in society and the political process,
	1.	Urges States:

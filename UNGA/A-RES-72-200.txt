	9.	Urges a continued focus on maximizing development gains from e-commerce, through initiatives such as eTrade for All, launched at the fourteenth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held in Nairobi from 17 to 22 July 2016, which provides a new approach to trade development through electronic exchanges by allowing developing countries to more easily navigate the supply of technical assistance for building capacity in e-commerce readiness and by enabling donors to have a clear picture of the programmes that they could fund;

	18.	Stresses the need for the enhanced participation of Governments and stakeholders from all developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, in all meetings of the Internet Governance Forum, and in this regard invites Member States, as well as other relevant stakeholders, to support the participation of Governments and all other stakeholders from developing countries in the Forum itself, as well as in the preparatory meetings; 
	19.	Notes the ongoing work of the Working Group on Enhanced Cooperation to develop recommendations on how to further implement enhanced cooperation as envisioned in the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, and stresses the need for the Working Group to enable the full involvement of all Governments and other relevant stakeholders, in particular from developing countries, taking into account all their diverse views and expertise; 
	20.	Encourages participants in the Working Group on Enhanced Cooperation to take forward their efforts to fulfil its mandate by submitting a report to the Commission on Science and Technology for Development at its twenty-first session, which would serve as an input to the regular reporting of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society; 
	21.

	26.	Further recognizes the importance of the free flow of information and knowledge, as the amount of information distributed worldwide grows and the role of communication becomes all the more important, and acknowledges that the mainstreaming of information and communications technologies in school curricula, open access to data, the fostering of competition, the creation of transparent, predictable, independent and non-discriminatory regulatory and legal systems, proportionate taxation and licensing fees, access to finance, the facilitation of public-private partnerships, multi-stakeholder cooperation, national and regional broadband strategies, efficient allocation of the radio frequency spectrum, infrastructure-sharing models, community-based approaches and public access facilities have in many countries facilitated significant gains in connectivity and sustainable development; 
	27.	Calls upon all stakeholders to keep the goal of bridging digital divides, in their different forms, an area of priority concern, to put into effect sound strategies that contribute to the development of e-government and to continue to focus on pro-poor information and communications technology policies and applications, including access to broadband at the grass-roots level, with a view to narrowing the digital divides among and within countries and, in turn, building information and knowledge societies; 
	28.	Notes the commitments made in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, and recognizes that official development assistance and other concessional financial flows for information and communications technologies can make significant contributions to development outcomes, in particular where they can reduce the risk of public and private investment, and increase the use of information and communications technologies to strengthen good governance and tax collection;

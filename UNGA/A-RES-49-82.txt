	[on the report of the First Committee (A/49/706)]


49/82.Implementation of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling the Declaration of the Indian Ocean as a Zone of Peace, contained in its resolution 2832 (XXVI) of 16 December 1971, and recalling also its resolution 48/82 of 16 December 1993 and other relevant resolutions,

	Recalling also the report of the Meeting of the Littoral and Hinterland States of the Indian Ocean held in July 1979, 1/

	Noting that the emerging international climate of confidence, trust and cooperation has been further enhanced by significant new developments in the Indian Ocean region, including the establishment of the democratic, non-racial Government of South Africa, as well as encouraging developments in the Middle East,

	Welcoming these positive developments, which have been reflected in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean as providing favourable opportunities to pursue global and regional cooperation in the Indian Ocean region,

	Having considered new alternative approaches in the Ad Hoc Committee with a view to reaching early agreement to give new impetus to the process of strengthening cooperation and ensuring peace, security and stability in the Indian Ocean region,

	Considering that confidence-building measures at different regional levels, building incrementally on cooperation among various regional and other parties, as appropriate, on specific issues, have made an important contribution to the attainment of the goals of peace, security and stability in the Indian Ocean region and that they should be pursued further,

	Emphasizing the need for the permanent members of the Security Council and the major maritime users of the Indian Ocean to cooperate with and participate in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee, particularly at a time when the Committee is actively engaged in the task of developing new alternative approaches,

	1.	Takes note of the report of the Ad Hoc Committee on the Indian Ocean; 2/

	2.	Requests the Ad Hoc Committee to continue its elaboration of new alternative approaches, including those discussed during the session held in 1994, with a view to giving new impetus to the process of strengthening cooperation and ensuring peace, security and stability in the Indian Ocean region;

	3.	Notes that the entry into force in November 1994 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 3/ would enhance prospects for mutually accommodative measures of cooperation on a regional as well as global basis, including the freedom of the high seas, in conformity with the Convention;

	4.	Reiterates its conviction that the participation of all permanent members of the Security Council as well as major maritime users in the work of the Ad Hoc Committee is important and would greatly facilitate development of a mutually beneficial dialogue to advance peace, security and stability in the Indian Ocean region;

	5.	Requests the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Committee to apprise the Governments of the permanent members of the Security Council concerned and the major maritime users of the progress of work in the Committee, and to consult with them in order to encourage their renewed participation and cooperation in the work of the Committee;

	6.	Recalls the general recognition of the need to pursue both global and regional efforts in a complementary way, bearing in mind that the States of the region could provide their own specific constructive contribution to the strengthening of peace, security, stability and cooperation in the Indian Ocean region;



	7.	Requests the Ad Hoc Committee to hold a session during 1995, of a duration of not more than five working days;

	8.	Also requests the Ad Hoc Committee to submit to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution;

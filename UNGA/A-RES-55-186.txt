	15.	Encourages the continuing efforts undertaken by the Bretton Woods institutions, the regional development banks and the International Labour Organization to help Governments to address the social consequences of crisis, and welcomes, in this regard, the commitments made by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session on the implementation of the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development, to ensure that, when structural adjustment programmes are agreed to, they include social development goals, in particular those of eradicating poverty, promoting full and productive employment and enhancing social integration;
	16.

	19.	Calls upon the international community, in particular the World Bank and the regional development banks, and other relevant international and regional institutions, including the regional commissions, working with the private sector, to support the promotion of long-term private financial flows, especially foreign direct investments, inter alia, through enhanced technical cooperation, to all developing countries as well as economies in transition, in particular the least developed countries and other developing countries with special difficulties in attracting private financial flows, including those in Africa, as well as the small island developing countries, and, in this context, requests the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to provide information to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session on the work it has undertaken on this matter;

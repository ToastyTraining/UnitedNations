	Acknowledging that action to combat desertification, restore degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and achieve a land degradation-neutral world can deliver multiple benefits and that land degradation neutrality has the potential to act as an accelerator for achieving Sustainable Development Goals and as a catalyst for attracting sustainable development financing and climate finance to implement the Convention, 
	Reaffirming its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports and complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with concrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to address the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels for sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity,

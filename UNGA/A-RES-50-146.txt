50/146.Strengthening the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme, particularly its technical cooperation capacity

	The General Assembly,

	Recognizing the direct relevance of crime prevention and criminal justice to sustained development, stability, security and improved quality of life,

	Convinced of the desirability of closer coordination and cooperation among States in combating crime, including drug-related crimes such as terrorist crimes, illicit arms trade and money laundering, and bearing in mind the role that could be played by both the United Nations and regional organizations in this respect,

	Bearing in mind the goals of the United Nations in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice, specifically the reduction of criminality, more efficient and effective law enforcement and administration of justice, respect for human rights and promotion of the highest standards of fairness, humanity and professional conduct,

	Recognizing the urgent need to increase technical cooperation activities to assist countries, particularly developing countries and countries in transition, with their efforts in translating United Nations policy guidelines into practice, including training and upgrading of national capacities,

	Noting the continued increase in the workload of the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch of the Secretariat, as well as the considerable obstacles to the full and effective implementation of its programme activities, resulting from the lack of appropriate institutional capacity,


	Convinced that the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch can be effective only if it is provided with resources commensurate to its requirements and adequate to allow it to implement its mandates and to respond in a timely and efficient manner to the increasing requests of Member States for its services,

	Recalling its resolution 49/158 of 23 December 1994, in which it requested the Secretary-General, as a matter of urgency, to give effect to General Assembly resolutions 47/91 of 16 December 1992 and 48/103 of 20 December 1993, and to Economic and Social Council resolutions 1992/22 of 30 July 1992, 1993/31 and 1993/34 of 27 July 1993 and 1994/16 of 25 July 1994 by providing the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme with sufficient resources for the full implementation of its mandates, in conformity with the high priority attached to the programme,

	Recalling also its resolution 49/159 of 23 December 1994, in which it resolved to take decisions at its fiftieth session on the allocation of adequate resources to the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme on the basis of proposals for the modification of the programme to be submitted by the Secretary-General, taking into account the responsibilities entrusted to the United Nations pursuant to the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan against Organized Transnational Crime, 1/

	Recalling further its resolution 46/152 of 18 December 1991 on the creation of an effective United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme, in which it approved the statement of principles and programme of action annexed to the resolution, in which it was recommended to the Secretary-General that an upgrading of the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch into a division should be effected as soon as possible,

	Concerned about the fact that despite the repeated calls by the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council to upgrade the Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Branch to a division, action has not been taken to give effect to the relevant Assembly and Council resolutions,

	Noting that the Secretary-General, in section 13 (Crime control) of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997, 2/ proposes the strengthening of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme in response to the repeated calls by the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council to that effect,

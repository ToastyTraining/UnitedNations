	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 52/200 of 18 December 1997, 53/185 of 15 December 1998, 54/220 of 22 December 1999, 55/197 of 20 December 2000, 56/194 of 21 December 2001, 57/255 of 20 December 2002, 59/232 of 22 December 2004, 61/199 of 20 December 2006, 63/215 of 19 December 2008, 65/158 of 20 December 2010 and 67/208 of 21 December 2012 and Economic and Social Council resolutions 1999/46 of 28 July 1999, 1999/63 of 30 July 1999 and 2000/33 of 28 July 2000, and taking into consideration all other relevant resolutions,
	Noting that the El Niño phenomenon has a recurring character and can lead to extensive natural hazards with the potential to seriously affect humankind,
	Reaffirming the importance of developing strategies at the national, subregional, regional and international levels that aim to prevent, mitigate and repair the damage caused by natural disasters resulting from the El Niño phenomenon,
	Noting that technological developments and international cooperation have enhanced the capabilities for the prediction of the El Niño phenomenon and thereby the potential for the preventive actions that may be taken to reduce its negative impacts,
	Taking into account the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled "The future we want",1 the Johannesburg Declaration on Sustainable Development2 and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development (Johannesburg Plan of Implementation),3 in particular paragraph 37 (i) thereof, and the outcome document of the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States, entitled the "SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway",4
	Reaffirming the Hyogo Declaration5 and the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters,6
	Noting the conclusion of the Secretary-General's Climate Summit, and welcoming its contribution to the existing political momentum with a view to galvanizing action to address climate change,
	Acknowledging the importance of the ongoing efforts to mainstream disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation across sustainable development efforts, including taking into account the future impacts of El Niño in disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation activities,
	Recognizing that the El Niño phenomenon is expected to occur in late 2014 or early 2015 and that it is likely to have a global impact,
	Recognizing also that most of the negative effects will occur in developing countries,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction,7 in particular the annex to the report, entitled "Update on international cooperation to reduce the impact of El Niño/La Niña", and calls upon the international community to make further efforts to assist countries affected by this phenomenon;
	2.	Recognizes the continued efforts being made by the Governments of Ecuador and Spain, the World Meteorological Organization and the inter-agency secretariat of the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction to support the International Research Centre on El Niño at Guayaquil, Ecuador, and encourages them and other members of the international community to continue such contributions for the advancement of the Centre;
	3.	Welcomes the activities undertaken so far to strengthen the International Research Centre on El Niño, through collaboration with international monitoring centres, including the national oceanographic institutions, and encourages further efforts to enhance regional and international recognition of and support for the Centre and to develop tools for decision makers and government authorities aimed at reducing the impact of the El Niño phenomenon;
	4.	Notes the contributions made by the International Research Centre on El Niño, as a reference centre on El Niño, including through developing a new climatic database for El Niño/Southern Oscillation-sensitive countries, carrying out applied research in climate change and vulnerability assessments in highlands, coastal zones and marine-protected and urban areas and providing professional training in the Americas, and encourages the sharing of best practices and lessons learned with climate centres located in other El Niño-affected regions;
	5.	Also notes the assistance provided to Governments by the International Research Centre on El Niño in the development of early warning systems that allow for the implementation of anticipatory risk reduction measures that contribute to the reduction of the potential human, economic and environmental impacts of the phenomenon;
	6.	Recognizes the technical and scientific support of the World Meteorological Organization in producing regionally coordinated monthly and seasonal forecasts, in particular its establishment of a consensus mechanism for the development of updates on El Niño/La Niña conditions, which receives contributions from several climate centres, including the International Research Centre on El Niño;
	7.	Encourages the World Meteorological Organization, in this regard, to continue to strengthen collaboration and the exchange of data and information with relevant institutions;
	8.	Notes the convening of the third International Conference on El Niño-Southern Oscillation in Guayaquil from 12 to 14 November 2014, which provided an opportunity to synthesize progress on research on the El Niño phenomenon, address linkages between climate and society and share experiences on El Niño vulnerability assessment methodologies;
	9.	Welcomes the convening of the Third World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan, from 14 to 18 March 2015, and acknowledges the ongoing preparatory process for the Conference, which is taking place in Geneva;
	10.	Calls upon the Secretary-General, the relevant United Nations organs, funds and programmes, in particular those taking part in the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction, and the international community to adopt, as appropriate, the measures necessary to further enhance the services provided by the International Research Centre on El Niño, and encourages the international community to provide scientific, technical and financial assistance and cooperation for this purpose, as well as to strengthen, as appropriate, other centres devoted to the study of the El Niño phenomenon;
	11.	Calls upon the international community to urgently provide financial, technical and capacity-building support to countries that are likely to be affected by the El Niño phenomenon;
	12.	Underlines the importance of maintaining the El Niño/Southern Oscillation observation system, continuing research into extreme weather events, improving forecasting skills and developing appropriate policies for reducing the impact of the El Niño phenomenon and other extreme weather events, and emphasizes the need to further develop and strengthen these institutional capacities in all countries, in particular developing countries;
	13.	Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report to the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, under the sub-item entitled "International Strategy for Disaster Reduction" of the item entitled "Sustainable development", a section on the implementation of the present resolution.

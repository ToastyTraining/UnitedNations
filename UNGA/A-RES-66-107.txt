Article 9
Answers, cross-appeals and answers to cross-appeals
4.	Within 45 days of notification of the appeal, a party answering the appeal may file a cross-appeal, accompanied by a brief which shall not exceed 15 pages, with the Appeals Tribunal stating the relief sought and the grounds of the cross-appeal. The cross-appeal may not add new claims.

2.	If, before the opening date of the session during which the case is to be considered, the appellant informs the Appeals Tribunal, in writing, with notice to the respondent, that he or she wishes to discontinue the proceedings, the President may order the case to be removed from the register. 
3.	If an action has become devoid of purpose and there is no longer any need to adjudicate it, the President may, at any time, of his or her own volition, after having informed the parties of that intention and, if applicable, received their observations, adopt a reasoned order.
4.	The President may designate a judge or a panel of judges to issue any order within the purview of the present article.

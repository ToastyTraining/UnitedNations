	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[without reference to a Main Committee (A/54/L.33 and Add.1)]


54/36.	Support by the United Nations system of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate new or restored democracies

    The General Assembly,

    Bearing in mind the indissoluble links between the principles enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 and the foundations of any democratic society,

    Recalling the Manila Declaration2 adopted by the First International Conference of New or Restored Democracies3 in June 1988,

    Considering the major changes taking place on the international scene and the aspirations of all peoples for an international order based on the principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, including the promotion and encouragement of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all and other important principles, such as respect for the equal rights and self-determination of peoples, peace, democracy, justice, equality, the rule of law, pluralism, development, better standards of living and solidarity,


    Recalling its resolution 49/30 of 7 December 1994 in which it recognized the importance of the Managua Declaration4 and Plan of Action5 adopted by the Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies in July 1994, as well as its resolutions 50/133 of 20 December 1995, 51/31 of  6 December 1996, 52/18 of 21 November 1997 and 53/31 of 23 November 1998,

    Recalling also the document entitled "Progress Review and Recommendations", adopted by the Third International Conference of New or Restored Democracies on Democracy and Development, held at Bucharest from 2 to 4 September 1997,6 in which guidelines, principles and recommendations were addressed to Governments, civil society, the private sector, donor countries and the international community,

    Noting in particular the recommendations contained in that document addressed to the United Nations system and the international financial organizations,7

    Taking note with satisfaction of the seminars, workshops and conferences on democratization and good governance organized in 1999, as well as those currently being planned, under the auspices of the International Conference of New or Restored Democracies,

    Taking note of the views of Member States expressed in the debate on this question at its forty-ninth, fiftieth, fifty-first, fifty-second, fifty-third and fifty-fourth sessions,

    Bearing in mind that the activities of the United Nations carried out in support of the efforts of Governments to promote and consolidate democracy are undertaken in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and only at the specific request of the Member States concerned,

    Also bearing in mind that democracy, development and respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that democracy is based on the freely expressed will of the people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and on their full participation in all aspects of their lives,

    Noting that a considerable number of societies have recently undertaken significant efforts to achieve their social, political and economic goals through democratization and the reform of their economies, pursuits that are deserving of the support and recognition of the international community,

    Noting with satisfaction that the Fourth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies will be held at Cotonou, Benin, from 4 to 6 December 2000,

    Stressing the importance of support by Member States, the United Nations system, the specialized agencies and other intergovernmental organizations for the holding of the Fourth International Conference of New or Restored Democracies,

[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/59/532/Add.1)]
59/298.	Reformed procedures for determining reimbursement to Member States for contingent-owned equipment


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 55/274 of 14 June 2001,
	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the reformed procedures for determining reimbursement to Member States for contingent-owned equipment,1 the letter dated 12 March 2004 from the Chairman of the 2004 Working Group on Contingent-Owned Equipment to the Chairman of the Fifth Committee2 and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,3
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the reformed procedures for determining reimbursement to Member States for contingent-owned equipment,1 the letter dated 12 March 2004 from the Chairman of the 2004 Working Group on Contingent-Owned Equipment to the Chairman of the Fifth Committee2 and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;3
	2.	Endorses the conclusions and recommendations contained in the reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, subject to the provisions of the present resolution;
	3.	Regrets that the 2004 Working Group on Contingent-Owned Equipment was unable to reach consensus on, inter alia, a review of the rates of reimbursement for contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment;
	4.	Decides to approve the proposal of the Secretary-General that the next Working Group on Contingent-Owned Equipment, which will meet in 2008, carry out a comprehensive review of the contingent-owned equipment system, as per the formats established by the Phase V Working Group, for a period of not less than fourteen working days;
	5.	Urges the Secretary-General to explore the possibility of holding the Working Group meeting earlier than 2008, if feasible;
	6.	Decides that the next Working Group on Contingent-Owned Equipment will consider, without prejudice to the comprehensive review of the contingent-owned equipment system, in recommending any revision of rates of reimbursement for contingent-owned equipment and self-sustainment, the fact that there was no revision of such rates for the period 2004 to 2008 owing to the lack of consensus on an increase in the rates and on the methodology of the 2004 Working Group;
	7.	Notes that, in addition to maintaining all existing components of the current methodology, the Secretary-General had proposed the inclusion of peacekeeping-related training costs and post-deployment medical costs in the troop reimbursement methodology;
	8.	Regrets that the 2004 Working Group on Contingent-Owned Equipment was unable to reach consensus on the components for inclusion in the troop-cost reimbursement methodology;
	9.	Notes that the report of the Secretary-General on the rates of reimbursement to the Governments of troop-contributing countries4 did not address all elements of the request made in paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution 55/274;
	10.	Reiterates its request contained in paragraph 8 of its resolution 55/274, and requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session a comprehensive report thereon, addressing all elements;
	11.	Notes that the Secretary-General, in preparing the comprehensive report, may utilize, as appropriate, external expertise;
	12.	Decides to review the daily allowance for troops at its resumed sixtieth session, based on information to be provided in the context of the comprehensive report referred to in paragraph 10 above;
	13.	Also decides to set up a channel of communication between the Secretariat and the Member States on the contingent-owned equipment system, strictly for the exchange of information and for seeking clarification and not for reaching decisions that are within the mandate of the Working Group on Contingent-Owned Equipment and relevant intergovernmental bodies.

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 19 December 2011
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/66/458)]
66/140.	The girl child


	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming its resolution 64/145 of 18 December 2009 and all relevant resolutions, including the agreed conclusions of the Commission on the Status of Women, in particular those relevant to the girl child,
	Reaffirming also the equal rights of women and men as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,
	Recalling all human rights and other instruments relevant to the rights of the child, in particular the girl child, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child,1 the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,2 the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,3 the Optional Protocols thereto4 and the Convention on Consent to Marriage, Minimum Age for Marriage and Registration of Marriages,5 
	Reaffirming the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, as well as the commitments relevant to the girl child made at the 2005 World Summit,6 and welcoming the outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals, entitled "Keeping the promise: united to achieve the Millennium Development Goals",7
	Reaffirming also the outcome document of the twenty-seventh special session of the General Assembly on children, entitled "A world fit for children",8 the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted at the twenty-sixth special session of the General Assembly on HIV/AIDS, entitled "Global Crisis - Global Action",9 and the Political Declaration on HIV/AIDS of 2006,10
	Reaffirming further all other relevant outcomes of major United Nations summits and conferences relevant to the girl child, as well as their five- and ten-year reviews, including the Beijing Declaration11 and Platform for Action12 adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women, the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century",13 the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development14 and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development,15 as well as the agreed conclusions adopted by the Commission on the Status on Women at its fifty-fifth session,16 at which it considered "Access and participation of women and girls in education, training and science and technology, including for the promotion of women's equal access to full employment and decent work" as its priority theme,
	Welcoming the adoption by the Commission on the Status of Women of the declaration on the occasion of the fifteenth anniversary of the Fourth World Conference on Women,17 and reiterating that full and effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, in particular the strategic objectives relating to the girl child, is essential to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals,
	Recalling the outcomes of the recent high-level meetings of the General Assembly relevant to the girl child,
	Recalling also the Secretary-General's 2008-2015 campaign "UNiTE to End Violence against Women" and the call upon Governments, civil society, women's organizations, young people, the private sector, the media and the entire United Nations system to join forces in addressing the global pandemic of violence against women and girls, 
	Reaffirming the importance of gender mainstreaming across the United Nations system, including in relation to the girl child,
	Recognizing that chronic poverty remains the single biggest obstacle to meeting the needs of and promoting and protecting the rights of children and that urgent national and international action is therefore required to eliminate it, and noting that the burden of the global financial and economic crisis, the energy crisis, the food crisis and the continuing food insecurity as a result of various factors is felt directly by households, especially those depending on income from the informal sector, and particularly by women and girls,
	Recognizing also that girl children are often at greater risk of being exposed to and encountering various forms of discrimination and violence, which continue to hinder efforts towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and reaffirming the need to achieve gender equality to ensure a just and equitable world for girls, including through partnering with men and boys, as an important strategy for advancing the rights of the girl child,
	Recognizing further that progress has been made in the adoption of national legislation that affirms the equality of girls and boys and that corresponding measures have not been taken to effectively implement such legislation, and recognizing the continuing existence of discrimination against women and girls throughout the world and that addressing this situation will require additional efforts to strengthen policy implementation, including through international cooperation,
	Recognizing that the empowerment of and investment in girls, which is critical for economic growth, and the achievement of all Millennium Development Goals, including the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty, as well as the meaningful participation of girls in decisions that affect them, are key in breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and in promoting and protecting the full and effective enjoyment of their human rights, and recognizing also that empowering girls requires their active participation in decision-making processes and the active support and engagement of their parents, legal guardians, families and care providers, boys and men, as well as the wider community,
	Deeply concerned about all forms of violence against children, in particular the phenomena that disproportionately affect girls, such as commercial sexual exploitation and child pornography, child and forced marriages, rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence and trafficking in persons and, in addition, about the corresponding lack of accountability and impunity, which reflect discriminatory norms reinforcing the lower status of girls in society,
	Deeply concerned also that violence against women and girls is underrecognized, particularly at the community level, and underreported or unrecorded because of stigma, fear, social tolerance and the often illegal and covert nature of such activities,
	Deeply concerned further about discrimination against the girl child and the violation of the rights of the girl child, which often result in less access for girls to education, and to quality education, nutrition and physical and mental health care, in girls enjoying fewer of the rights, opportunities and benefits of childhood and adolescence than boys, and in leaving them more vulnerable than boys to the consequences of unprotected and premature sexual relations and often being subjected to various forms of cultural, social, sexual and economic exploitation and violence, abuse, rape, incest, honour-related crimes and harmful traditional practices, such as female infanticide, child and forced marriages, prenatal sex selection and female genital mutilation,
	Deeply concerned that child and forced marriages expose young married girls to greater risk of HIV and sexually transmitted infections, often lead to early childbearing and increase the risk of disability, stillbirth and maternal death, and reduce their opportunities to complete their education, gain comprehensive knowledge, participate in the community or develop employable skills, and violate and impair the full enjoyment of the human rights of women and girls,
	Deeply concerned also that early pregnancy and early childbearing and limited access to sexual and reproductive health care, including in the area of skilled birth attendance and emergency obstetric care, cause high prevalences of obstetric fistula and high levels of maternal mortality and morbidity and furthermore entail complications during pregnancy and childbirth which often lead to death, particularly for young women and girls, 
	Recognizing that progress towards ending child and forced marriages can have a positive impact on indicators related to girls' education, maternal health and child health, thereby contributing to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals,
	Deeply concerned that, despite their widespread practice, child and forced marriages are still underreported, and recognizing that this requires further attention,
	Deeply concerned also that female genital mutilation violates and impairs the full enjoyment of the human rights of women and girls and that it is an irreparable and irreversible harmful practice, and that the goal of ending female genital mutilation by 2010, set out in the document entitled "A world fit for children", remains unmet, 
	Deeply concerned further that, in situations of poverty, war and armed conflict, girl children are among those most affected and furthermore become the victims of sexual violence, abuse and exploitation and sexually transmitted infections and diseases, including HIV and AIDS, which have a serious impact on the quality of their lives and leave them open to further discrimination, violence and neglect, thus limiting their potential for full development,
	Emphasizing that increased access to education for young people, especially girls, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, dramatically lowers their vulnerability to preventable diseases, in particular HIV infection and sexually transmitted diseases,
	Recognizing that early childbearing continues to be an impediment to the improvement of the educational and social status of girls in all parts of the world and that, overall, child and forced marriages and early motherhood can severely curtail their educational opportunities and are likely to have a long-term, adverse impact on their employment opportunities and on their and their children's quality of life, 
	Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance reveal themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls and can be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and limitation or denial of their human rights,
	Recognizing that women and girls with disabilities are subject to multiple forms of discrimination, including in respect of their access to education and employment, and the importance of the implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in this regard,
	Noting with concern that, in some parts of the world, men outnumber women as a result, in part, of harmful attitudes and practices, such as female genital mutilation, son preference, which results in female infanticide and prenatal sex selection, early marriage, including child marriage, violence against women, sexual exploitation, sexual abuse and discrimination against girls in food allocation and in other practices related to health and well-being, with the result that fewer girls than boys survive into adulthood,
	Deeply concerned that the phenomenon of child-headed households, in particular those headed by girls, is becoming a serious social problem,
	Deeply concerned also that the impact of the HIV and AIDS epidemic, including illness and mortality, erosion of the extended family, exacerbation of poverty, unemployment and underemployment, and migration, as well as urbanization, have contributed to the increase in the number of child-headed households,
	Recognizing that women and girls bear the disproportionate burden of caring for and supporting those living with and affected by HIV and AIDS, and that this impacts negatively on girls by depriving them of their childhood and diminishing their opportunities to receive an education,
	1.	Stresses the need for full and urgent implementation of the rights of the girl child as provided to her under human rights instruments, and urges States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the Convention on the Rights of the Child,1 the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,2 the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities3 and the Optional Protocols thereto4 as a matter of priority;
	2.	Urges all States that have not yet signed and ratified or acceded to the Minimum Age Convention, 1973 (No. 138)18 and the Worst Forms of Child Labour Convention, 1999 (No. 182),19 of the International Labour Organization to consider doing so;
	3.	Urges all Governments and the United Nations system to strengthen efforts bilaterally and with international organizations and private sector donors in order to achieve the goals of the World Education Forum,20 in particular that of eliminating gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005, which have not been fully met, and to implement the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative as a means of reaching this goal, and calls for the implementation of and reaffirms the commitments contained in the Education for All goals and the Millennium Development Goals, particularly those related to gender and education;
	4.	Calls upon all States to place enhanced emphasis on quality education for the girl child, including catch-up and literacy education for those who did not receive formal education, to promote access to skills and entrepreneurial training for young women and to tackle male and female stereotypes in order to ensure that young women entering the labour market have opportunities to obtain full and productive employment and decent work; 
	5.	Encourages States to promote the development of gender-sensitive curricula for educational programmes at all levels and to take concrete measures to ensure that educational materials portray women and men, youth, girls and boys in positive and non-stereotypic roles, particularly in the teaching of scientific and technological subjects, in order to address the root causes of segregation in working life;
	6.	Calls upon States and the international community to recognize the right to education on the basis of equal opportunity and non-discrimination by making primary education compulsory and available free to all children, and ensuring that all children have access to education of good quality, as well as making secondary education generally available and accessible to all, in particular through the progressive introduction of free education, bearing in mind that special measures to ensure equal access, including affirmative action, contribute to achieving equal opportunity and combating exclusion, and ensuring school attendance, in particular for girls and children from low-income families; 
	7.	Calls upon States, with the support of international organizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, as appropriate, to develop policies and programmes, giving priority to formal and informal education programmes, including age-appropriate sex education, with appropriate direction and guidance from parents and legal guardians, that support girls and enable them to acquire knowledge, develop self-esteem and take responsibility for their own lives, and to place special focus on programmes to educate women and men, especially parents, about the importance of girls' physical and mental health and well-being, including the elimination of discrimination against girls in child and forced marriages;
	8.	Calls upon all States and international and non-governmental organizations, individually and collectively, to implement further the Beijing Platform for Action,12 in particular the strategic objectives relating to the girl child, and the further actions and initiatives to implement the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action,21 and to mobilize all necessary resources and support in order to achieve the goals and strategic objectives and actions set out in the Beijing Declaration11 and Platform for Action;
	9.	Calls upon all States to take measures to address the obstacles that continue to affect the achievement of the goals set forth in the Beijing Platform for Action, as contained in paragraph 33 of the further actions and initiatives, where appropriate, including the strengthening of national mechanisms to implement policies and programmes for the girl child and, in some cases, to enhance coordination among responsible institutions for the realization of the human rights of girls, as indicated in the further actions and initiatives;
	10.	Urges States to strengthen efforts to urgently eradicate all forms of discrimination against women and girls and, where applicable, to remain dedicated to the implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and the Optional Protocol thereto;22 
	11.	Also urges States to fulfil the pledges that they made at the Fourth World Conference on Women and at the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly to modify or abolish remaining laws that discriminate against women and girls;
	12.	Further urges States to improve the situation of girl children living in poverty, deprived of nutrition, water and sanitation facilities, with limited or no access to basic physical and mental health-care services, shelter, education, participation and protection, taking into account that, while a severe lack of goods and services hurts every human being, it is most threatening and harmful to the girl child, leaving her unable to enjoy her rights, to reach her full potential and to participate as a full member of society;
	13.	Urges States to ensure that the applicable requirements of the International Labour Organization for the employment of girls and boys are respected and effectively enforced and that girls who are employed have equal access to decent work, and equal payment and remuneration, are protected from economic exploitation, discrimination, sexual harassment, violence and abuse in the workplace, are aware of their rights and have access to formal and non-formal education, skills development and vocational training, and also urges States to develop gender-sensitive measures, including national action plans, where appropriate, to eliminate the worst forms of child labour, including commercial sexual exploitation, slavery-like practices, forced and bonded labour, trafficking and hazardous forms of child labour;
	14.	Recognizes the importance of strengthening health systems, in particular primary health care and the need to integrate the HIV response into it, and notes that weak health systems, which already face many challenges, including a lack of trained health workers and insufficient retention of skilled health workers, are among the biggest barriers to accessing health care; 
	15.	Calls upon States, with the support of relevant stakeholders including the private sector, civil society, non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations, as appropriate, to take all measures necessary to ensure the right of girls to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health, including sexual and reproductive health, and to develop sustainable health systems and social services;
	16.	Urges all States to promote gender equality and equal access to basic social services, such as education, nutrition, birth registration, health care, including sexual and reproductive health, vaccinations and protection from diseases representing the major causes of mortality, including non-communicable diseases, and to mainstream a gender perspective in all development policies and programmes, including those relating to children as well as those specific to the girl child; 
	17.	Calls upon States, with the support of international organizations and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, and the media, to take appropriate measures to address the root factors of child and forced marriages, including by undertaking educational activities to raise awareness regarding the negative aspects of such practices;
	18.	Urges all States to enact and strictly enforce laws to ensure that marriage is entered into only with the free and full consent of the intending spouses, and, in addition, to enact and strictly enforce laws concerning the minimum legal age of consent and the minimum age for marriage and raise the minimum age for marriage where necessary, and to develop and implement comprehensive policies, plans of action and programmes for the survival, protection, development and advancement of the girl child in order to promote and protect the full enjoyment of her human rights and to ensure equal opportunities for girls, including by making such plans an integral part of her total development process;
	19.	Urges States to ensure that efforts to enact and implement legislation to end child and forced marriages engage all stakeholders and agents of change and ensure that the information on the legislation against the practice is well known and generates social support for the enforcement of such laws and legislation;
	20.	Calls upon States to support community workshops and discussion sessions to enable communities to collectively explore ways to prevent and address child and forced marriages, provide information through stakeholders who are credible to the community, such as medical personnel and local, community and religious leaders, regarding the harm associated with these marriages, give greater voice to girls and ensure consistence of message throughout the entire community, and encourage the much-needed strong engagement of men and boys;
	21.	Also calls upon States to support and implement, including with dedicated resources, multisectoral policies and programmes that end the practice of child and forced marriages and ensure the provision of viable alternatives and institutional support, especially educational opportunities for girls, with an emphasis on keeping girls in school through post-primary education, including those who are already married or pregnant, ensuring physical access to education, including by establishing safe residential facilities, increasing financial incentives to families, promoting the empowerment of girls, improving educational quality and ensuring safe and hygienic conditions in schools;
	22.	Further calls upon States to strengthen research, data collection and analysis on the girl child, disaggregated by sex, age and geographical location, in order to provide a better understanding of the situations of girls, especially of the multiple forms of discrimination that they face, and to develop necessary policies and programme responses, which should take a holistic approach to addressing the full range of the forms of discrimination that girls may face, in order to protect their rights effectively;
	23.	Urges States to take all measures necessary to ensure the full enjoyment by girls with disabilities of all human rights and fundamental freedoms on an equal basis with other children, and to adopt, implement and strengthen appropriate policies and programmes designed to address their needs;

	27.	Urges States to formulate comprehensive, multidisciplinary and coordinated national plans, programmes or strategies to eliminate all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, which should be widely disseminated and should provide targets and timetables for implementation, as well as effective domestic enforcement procedures through the establishment of monitoring mechanisms involving all parties concerned, including consultations with women's organizations, giving attention to the recommendations relating to the girl child of the Special Rapporteurs of the Human Rights Council on violence against women, its causes and consequences, and on trafficking in persons, especially women and children, and of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children; 
	28.	Also urges States to ensure that the right of children to express themselves and to participate in all matters affecting them, in accordance with their age and maturity, is fully and equally enjoyed by girls;
	29.	Further urges States to involve girls, including girls with special needs, and their representative organizations, in decision-making processes, as appropriate, and to include them as full and active partners in identifying their own needs and in developing, planning, implementing and assessing policies and programmes to meet those needs; 
	30.	Recognizes that a considerable number of girl children are particularly vulnerable, including orphans, children living on the street, internally displaced and refugee children, children affected by trafficking and sexual and economic exploitation, children living with or affected by HIV and AIDS, and children who are incarcerated who live without parental support, and therefore urges States, with the support of the international community, where relevant, to take appropriate measures to address the needs of such children by implementing national policies and strategies to build and strengthen governmental, community and family capacities to provide a supportive environment for such children, including by providing appropriate counselling and psychosocial support, and ensuring their enrolment in school and access to shelter, good nutrition and health and social services on an equal basis with other children;

	33.	Deplores all cases of sexual exploitation and abuse of women and children, especially girls, in humanitarian crises, including those cases involving humanitarian workers and peacekeepers, and urges States to take effective measures to address gender-based violence in humanitarian emergencies and to make all possible efforts to ensure that their laws and institutions are adequate to prevent, promptly investigate and prosecute acts of gender-based violence;
	34.

	37.	Calls upon Governments, civil society, including the media, and non-governmental organizations to promote human rights education and full respect for and the enjoyment of the human rights of the girl child, inter alia, through the translation, production and dissemination of age-appropriate and gender-sensitive information material on those rights to all sectors of society, in particular to children;
	38.	Requests the Secretary-General, as Chair of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, to ensure that all organizations and bodies of the United Nations system, individually and collectively, in particular the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the World Food Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), the World Health Organization, the United Nations Development Programme, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Labour Organization, take into account the rights and the particular needs of the girl child in country programmes of cooperation in accordance with national priorities, including through the United Nations Development Assistance Framework;
	39.	Requests all human rights treaty bodies and the human rights mechanisms of the Human Rights Council, including the special procedures, to adopt regularly and systematically a gender perspective in the implementation of their mandates and to include in their reports information on the qualitative analysis of violations of the human rights of women and girls, and encourages the strengthening of cooperation and coordination in that regard;
	40.	Requests States to ensure that, in all policies and programmes designed to provide comprehensive HIV and AIDS prevention, treatment, care and support, particular attention and support are given to the girl child at risk, living with or affected by HIV, including pregnant girls and young and adolescent mothers and girls with disabilities, with a view to achieving Millennium Development Goal 6, in particular to halt and begin to reverse by 2015 the spread of HIV; 
	41.	Invites States to promote initiatives aimed at reducing the prices of antiretroviral drugs, especially second-line drugs, available to the girl child, including bilateral and private sector initiatives as well as initiatives on a voluntary basis taken by groups of States, including those based on innovative financing mechanisms that contribute to the mobilization of resources for social development, including those that aim to provide further access to drugs at affordable prices to developing countries on a sustainable and predictable basis, and in this regard takes note of the International Drug Purchase Facility, UNITAID;
	42.	Calls upon all States to integrate food and nutritional support with the goal that children, especially girl children, have access at all times to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences, for an active and healthy life, as part of a comprehensive response to HIV and AIDS, other communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases; 
	43.	Urges States and the international community to increase resources at all levels, particularly in the education and health sectors, so as to enable young people, especially girls, to gain the knowledge, attitudes and life skills that they need to overcome their challenges, including the prevention of HIV infection and early pregnancy, and to enjoy the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health, including sexual and reproductive health;
	44.	Stresses the need to strengthen the commitment of States and the United Nations system in their responsibility to mainstream the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, in particular the girl child, in the development agenda at the national, regional and international levels;
	45.	Urges States, the international community, the relevant United Nations entities, civil society and international financial institutions to continue to actively support, through the allocation of increased human and financial resources, targeted innovative programmes that address ending female genital mutilation and developing and providing education programmes, such as the United Nations Population Fund-United Nations Children's Fund joint programme on accelerating the abandonment of female genital mutilation, and sensitization workshops on the dire consequences of this harmful practice for the health of the girl, and to provide training programmes for those who perform the harmful procedure so that they may adopt an alternative profession;
	46.	Stresses that a common coordinated approach that promotes positive social change at the community, national and international levels could lead to the abandonment of female genital mutilation within a generation, with some of the main achievements being obtained by 2015, in line with the Millennium Development Goals;
	47.	Urges States, the international community, the relevant United Nations entities, civil society and the international financial institutions to actively support, through the allocation of increased human and financial resources, efforts to end child and forced marriages;
	48.	Calls upon States to strengthen the capacity of national health systems, and in this regard calls upon the international community to assist national efforts, including by allocation of adequate resources in order to provide essential services needed to prevent obstetric fistula and to treat those cases that occur by providing the continuum of services, including family planning, prenatal and postnatal care, skilled birth attendance, emergency obstetric care and post-partum care, to adolescent girls, including those living in poverty and in underserved rural areas where obstetric fistula is most common;
	49.	Calls upon States and the international community to create an environment in which the well-being of the girl child is ensured, inter alia, by cooperating, supporting and participating in global efforts for poverty eradication at the global, regional and country levels, recognizing that strengthened availability and effective allocation of resources are required at all levels, in order to ensure that all the internationally agreed development and poverty eradication goals, including those set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,27 are realized within their time framework, and reaffirming that investment in children, particularly girls, and the realization of their rights are among the most effective ways to eradicate poverty;
	50.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session on the implementation of the present resolution, including an emphasis on child-headed households: causes, effects and prospects, using information provided by Member States, the organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations, with a view to assessing the impact of the present resolution on the well-being of the girl child.

Notes that as a result of the expanded range of activities in the Situation Centre, there is a need for a broader and balanced range of skills and qualifications, including but not limited to knowledge of operational military and civilian police issues, among the Situation Centre officers, and in this regard requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the 11 Operations Officer (P-3) posts are available for incumbency to all qualified candidates, including officers seconded from Member States, keeping in mind the importance of representation of major troop-contributing countries;

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 18 December 2013
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/68/457)]
68/191.	Taking action against gender-related killing of women and girls
	The General Assembly,
	Deeply concerned that the global prevalence of different manifestations of the gender-related killing of women and girls1 is reaching alarming proportions,
	Concerned about violent gender-related killing of women and girls, while recognizing efforts made to address that form of violence in different regions, including in countries where the concept of femicide or feminicide has been incorporated into national legislation,
	Aware that the Universal Declaration of Human Rights2 affirms the principle of the inadmissibility of discrimination and proclaims that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and that everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration, especially to the right to life, liberty and security of person, without distinction of any kind, including distinction based on sex, 
	Emphasizing the importance of the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women,3 which defines violence against women as any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private spheres,
	Conscious of the commitments undertaken by States parties through the adoption of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,4 which requires State parties to take all appropriate political, social, economic and cultural measures, including legislation, to ensure the full development and advancement of women, for the purpose of guaranteeing them the exercise and enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms on a basis of equality with men, taking into account the Optional Protocol to the Convention,5 
	Taking into consideration the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action adopted at the Fourth World Conference on Women,6 which identifies violence against women as an obstacle to the achievement of the objectives of equality, development and peace, while emphasizing that such violence both violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment by women of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
	Reaffirming the obligation of all States to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, and reaffirming that discrimination on the basis of sex is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and other international human rights instruments and that the elimination of such discrimination is an integral part of efforts towards the elimination of all forms of violence against women, 
	Stressing that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent and investigate acts of violence against women and girls and punish the perpetrators, eliminate impunity and provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment by victims of their human rights and fundamental freedoms, 
	Bearing in mind the actions and measures that Member States should take to meet their international obligations with respect to putting an end to violence against women and girls,
	Recalling the relevant General Assembly resolutions addressing various aspects of violence against women and girls of all ages, 
	Stressing the significance of the updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice7 as a way to assist countries in strengthening their national crime prevention and criminal justice capacities to respond to all forms of violence against women, 
	Taking note of the report of the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences8 and Human Rights Council resolution 20/12 of 5 July 2012 on accelerating efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women: remedies for women who have been subjected to violence,9 
	Taking note with appreciation of the agreed conclusions of the fifty-seventh session of the Commission on the Status of Women of 15 March 2013,10 in which, inter alia, the Commission urged all Governments to strengthen national legislation, where appropriate, to punish violent gender-related killing of women and girls and integrate specific mechanisms or policies to prevent, investigate and eradicate such deplorable forms of gender-based violence, 
	Taking note with appreciation also of the various initiatives taken at the regional level to prevent and address violence against women, including, for example, the Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women, the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation Convention on Preventing and Combating Trafficking in Women and Children for Prostitution, the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Region, the Council of Europe Convention on Preventing and Combating Violence against Women and Domestic Violence and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, 
	Expressing its appreciation for the work undertaken by the United Nations system in preventing and responding to all forms of violence against women and girls, 
	Viewing with appreciation the considerable input of many civil society organizations, as well as academia, in addressing the different forms of violence against women and girls, through research and direct action in their respective communities, 
	Alarmed by the fact that violence against women and girls is among the least punished crimes in the world,

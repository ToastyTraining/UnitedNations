[on the report of the Third Committee (A/70/489/Add.2)]
70/165.	Protection of and assistance to internally displaced persons


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling that internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border,1
	Recognizing that internally displaced persons are to enjoy, in full equality, the same rights and freedoms under international and domestic law as do other persons in their country,
	Deeply disturbed by the alarmingly high numbers of internally displaced persons throughout the world, for reasons including violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law, armed conflict, persecution, violence and other reasons, including terrorism, as well as natural and human-made disasters, who receive inadequate protection and assistance, and conscious of the serious challenges that this is creating for the international community,
	Recognizing that natural disasters are a cause of internal displacement, and concerned about factors, such as climate change, that are expected to exacerbate the impact of natural hazards and climate-related events,
	Recognizing also that the risk of becoming displaced as a result of a natural disaster has doubled in the last four decades and that the consequences of hazards can be prevented or substantially mitigated by integrating disaster risk reduction strategies into national development policies and programmes,
	Recognizing further that internally displaced persons can be exposed to increased vulnerability when their host communities are affected by natural disasters,
	Conscious of the human rights, humanitarian and development dimensions, as well as the possible peacebuilding dimension, of internal displacement, including in long-term displacement situations, the often heightened vulnerability of women and children as well as older persons and persons with disabilities and the responsibilities of States and the international community to further strengthen their protection and assistance, including by respecting and protecting the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all internally displaced persons, with a view to finding durable solutions,
	Emphasizing that States have the primary responsibility to provide protection and assistance to internally displaced persons within their jurisdiction, without discrimination, as well as to address the root causes of the displacement problem and support solutions in appropriate cooperation with the international community,
	Reaffirming that all persons, including those who are internally displaced, have the right to freedom of movement and residence and should be protected against arbitrary displacement,
	Noting the need for increased awareness by the international community of the issue of internal displacement worldwide, including the situation of millions living in protracted situations of displacement, many of them outside camp settings and in urban areas, and the urgency of providing adequate humanitarian assistance to and protection for internally displaced persons, ensuring protection from landmines and other explosive remnants of war, supporting local host communities, addressing the root causes of displacement, and finding durable solutions for internally displaced persons in their countries and addressing possible obstacles in this regard, and recognizing that durable solutions include voluntary return in safety and with dignity, as well as voluntary local integration in the areas to which persons have been displaced or voluntary settlement in another part of the country, without prejudice to the right of internally displaced persons to leave their country or to seek asylum,
	Emphasizing that ensuring durable solutions for internally displaced persons, including the right of voluntary return in safety and with dignity, should be approached from a humanitarian and development perspective,
	Recalling the relevant norms of international law, including international human rights law, international humanitarian law and international refugee law, and recognizing that the protection of internally displaced persons has been strengthened by identifying, reaffirming and consolidating specific standards for their protection, in particular through the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement,2
	Recalling also the relevance of international humanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions of 19493 and the Additional Protocols thereto of 1977,4 as a vital legal framework for the protection of and assistance to civilians in armed conflict and under foreign occupation, including internally displaced persons,
	Recognizing that violations of international humanitarian law can cause displacement, and recalling that displacement could be reduced if international humanitarian law was respected by all parties to armed conflict, in particular the fundamental principles of distinction, proportionality and precaution, as well as the prohibition of forced displacement of the civilian population, unless the security of the civilians involved or imperative military reasons so demand,5
	Welcoming the increasing dissemination, promotion, application and integration into domestic laws and policies of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement when dealing with situations of internal displacement,
	Deploring practices of forced displacement and their negative consequences for the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by large groups of populations, and recalling the relevant provisions of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court that define the deportation or forcible transfer of population as a crime against humanity and the unlawful deportation, transfer or ordering of the displacement of the civilian population as war crimes,6
	Expressing its appreciation to those Governments and intergovernmental, regional and non-governmental organizations that have supported and facilitated the work of the Special Rapporteur of the Human Rights Council on the human rights of internally displaced persons, and of his predecessor, the former Representative of the Secretary-General on the human rights of internally displaced persons and, according to their roles and responsibilities, have helped to provide protection and assistance to internally displaced persons,
	Welcoming the continuing cooperation between the Special Rapporteur and national Governments and the relevant offices and agencies of the United Nations as well as with other international and regional organizations, and encouraging further strengthening of this collaboration in order to promote better strategies for, protection of, assistance to and durable solutions for internally displaced persons,
	Acknowledging with appreciation the important and independent contribution of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement and other humanitarian agencies in protecting and assisting internally displaced persons, in cooperation with national Governments and relevant international bodies,
	Welcoming the priorities set by the Special Rapporteur as contained in his report to the Human Rights Council at its sixteenth session7 and the two strategic objectives of supporting Governments in developing national instruments and institutions on internal displacement and facilitating viable durable solutions for internally displaced persons, including through the engagement of development actors,

	Recalling also its resolution 68/180 of 18 December 2013 and Human Rights Council resolution 23/8 of 13 June 2013,9
	Reaffirming its resolution 46/182 of 19 December 1991 and the guiding principles contained in the annex thereto, other relevant General Assembly and Economic and Social Council resolutions and agreed conclusions of the Council, reaffirming also the principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence in the provision of humanitarian assistance, and reaffirming further the need for all actors engaged in the provision of humanitarian assistance in situations of complex emergencies and natural disasters to promote and fully respect these principles,

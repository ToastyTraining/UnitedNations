	The General Assembly,
	Recalling that internally displaced persons are persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized State border,1
	Recognizing that internally displaced persons are to enjoy, in full equality, the same rights and freedoms under international and domestic law as do other persons in their country, 
	Deeply disturbed by the alarmingly high numbers of internally displaced persons throughout the world, for reasons including armed conflict, violations of human rights and natural or human-made disasters, who receive inadequate protection and assistance, and conscious of the serious challenges that this is creating for the international community,
	Recognizing that natural disasters are a cause of internal displacement, and concerned about factors, such as climate change, that are expected to exacerbate the impact of natural hazards, and climate-related slow-onset events, 
	Recognizing also that the consequences of hazards can be prevented or substantially mitigated by integrating disaster risk reduction strategies into national development policies and programmes, 
	Conscious of the human rights and humanitarian dimensions of the problem of internally displaced persons, including in long-term displacement situations, and the responsibilities of States and the international community to strengthen further their protection and assistance, 
	Emphasizing that States have the primary responsibility to provide protection and assistance to internally displaced persons within their jurisdiction, as well as to address the root causes of the displacement problem in appropriate cooperation with the international community, 
	Reaffirming that all persons, including those internally displaced, have the right to freedom of movement and residence and should be protected against being arbitrarily displaced,2
	Noting the international community's growing awareness of the issue of internally displaced persons worldwide and the urgency of addressing the root causes of their displacement and finding durable solutions, including voluntary return in safety and with dignity, as well as voluntary local integration in the areas to which persons have been displaced or voluntary settlement in another part of the country, 
	Recalling the relevant norms of international law, including international human rights law, international humanitarian law and international refugee law, and recognizing that the protection of internally displaced persons has been strengthened by identifying, reaffirming and consolidating specific standards for their protection, in particular through the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement,3 
	Noting, in this regard, that 2009 marks the sixtieth anniversary of the Geneva Conventions of 1949,4 which constitute one vital legal framework for the protection of and assistance to civilians in armed conflict and under foreign occupation, including internally displaced persons, 
	Welcoming the adoption on 22 October 2009 of the African Union Convention for the Protection and Assistance of Internally Displaced Persons in Africa,5 which marks a significant step towards strengthening the national and regional normative framework for the protection of and assistance to internally displaced persons,
	Welcoming also the increasing dissemination, promotion and application of the Guiding Principles when dealing with situations of internal displacement, 
	Deploring practices of forced displacement and their negative consequences for the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by large groups of populations, and recalling the relevant provisions of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court that define the deportation or forcible transfer of population as a crime against humanity, and the unlawful deportation, transfer, or ordering the displacement of the civilian population as war crimes,6

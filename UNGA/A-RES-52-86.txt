	ANNEX

Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice


1.	The multifaceted nature of violence against women suggests that different strategies are required for different manifestations of violence and the various settings in which it occurs.  The practical measures, strategies and activities described below can be introduced in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice to deal with the problem of violence against women.  Except where otherwise specified, the term "women" encompasses "girl children".

2.	Recalling the definition of violence against women contained in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women7 and reiterated in the Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women,3 the Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice build upon the measures adopted by Governments in the Platform for Action, bearing in mind that some groups of women are especially vulnerable to violence.

3.	The Model Strategies and Practical Measures specifically acknowledge the need for an active policy of bringing into the mainstream a gender perspective in all policies and programmes related to violence against women and of achieving gender equality and equal and fair access to justice, as well as establishing the goal of gender balance in areas of decision-making related to the elimination of violence against women.  The Model Strategies and Practical Measures should be applied as guidelines in a manner consistent with relevant international instruments, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,1 the Convention on the Rights of the Child8 and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,9 with a view to furthering their fair and effective implementation.

4.	The Model Strategies and Practical Measures should be implemented by Member States and other entities, without prejudice to the principle of gender equality before the law, in order to facilitate the efforts by Governments to deal with the various manifestations of violence against women within the criminal justice system.

5.	The Model Strategies and Practical Measures are aimed at providing de jure and de facto equality between women and men.  The Model Strategies and Practical Measures do not give preferential treatment to women but are aimed at ensuring that any inequalities or forms of discrimination that women face in achieving access to justice, particularly in respect of acts of violence, are redressed.

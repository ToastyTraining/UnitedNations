	Recognizing that, despite the fact that increased global and national investments in malaria control have yielded significant results in decreasing the burden of malaria in many countries, and that some countries are moving towards the elimination of malaria, many countries continue to have unacceptably high burdens of malaria and in order to reach the internationally agreed development goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, must rapidly increase malaria prevention and control efforts, which rely heavily on medicines and insecticides whose utility is continuously threatened by the development of resistance to antimalarial agents, as well as resistance of mosquitoes to insecticides and their shift to outdoor biting and resting, 
	Aware that recent successes in prevention and control are fragile and can be maintained only with sufficient and sustained national and international investment to fund global malaria control efforts fully, 
	Regretting the high number of people still without access to medicines, and underscoring that improving access to medicines could save millions of lives every year, 
	Recognizing the serious challenges relating to substandard, falsified and counterfeit drugs, poor malaria diagnostics and poor quality of vector control products,
	Expressing concern about the continued morbidity, mortality and debility attributed to malaria, and recalling that more efforts are needed as countries transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the Sustainable Development Goals and focus on targets set out in the Global Technical Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030 and the Action and Investment to Defeat Malaria 2016-2030 plan to reduce malaria mortality rates by 90 per cent by 2030, 
	Gravely concerned about the health burden of malaria worldwide, with 214 million cases and 438,000 deaths reported in 2015 alone,8 in particular in sub-Saharan Africa, where an estimated 90 per cent of the deaths occur, affecting mostly young children, 
	Emphasizing the importance of strengthening health systems to effectively sustain malaria control and elimination efforts and enable appropriate responses to other health issues and emergencies, including investment in entomology and vector control for human resources and infrastructures,
	Commending the efforts of the World Health Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund, the Roll Back Malaria Partnership, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Bank and other partners to fight malaria over the years,

	3.	Takes note with appreciation of the catalytic framework to end AIDS and tuberculosis and eliminate malaria in Africa by 2030 adopted by the African Union at its twenty-seventh Summit, held in Kigali from 10 to 18 July 2016; 
	4.	Calls upon Member States, with the support of development partners, to provide universal access to existing life-saving tools for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of malaria, in particular to the package of core interventions recommended by the World Health Organization,11 and to ensure equity in access to health services for all people at risk of contracting malaria, especially for the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach populations, including by strengthening cross-collaboration;12

	24.	Expresses deep concern about emerging drug and insecticide resistance in several regions of the world, calls upon Member States, with support from the World Health Organization and other partners, to implement the Global Plan for Artemisinin Resistance Containment and the Global Plan for Insecticide Resistance Management in Malaria Vectors and to strengthen and implement surveillance systems for monitoring and assessing changing patterns of drug and insecticide resistance, calls upon the World Health Organization to support Member States in the development of their national insecticide resistance management strategies and to coordinate support at the international level for countries to ensure that drug efficacy and insecticide resistance testing is fully operational in order to enhance the use of artemisinin-based combination therapies and insecticides, and stresses that the data gathered should be utilized to inform local decisions and for further research and development of safe and effective therapies and new vector control tools;
	25.	Urges all Member States to prohibit the marketing and use of oral artemisinin-based monotherapies and to replace them with oral artemisinin-based combination therapies, as recommended by the World Health Organization, and to develop the financial, legislative and regulatory mechanisms necessary to introduce artemisinin combination therapies at affordable prices in both public and private facilities;

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/53/745/Add.1)]


53/228.	Financing of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission and the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola


    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

    Bearing in mind Security Council resolutions 626 (1988) of 20 December 1988, by which the Council established the United Nations Angola Verification Mission, 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991, by which the Council decided to entrust a new mandate to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (thenceforth called the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II), 976 (1995) of 8 February 1995, by which the Council authorized the establishment of a peacekeeping operation (thenceforth called the United Nations Angola Verification Mission III), 1118 (1997) of 30 June 1997, by which the Council decided to establish, as from 1 July 1997, the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola, and its subsequent resolutions, the latest of which was resolution 1229 (1999) of 26 February 1999,


    Recalling its resolution 43/231 of 16 February 1989 on the financing of the Verification Mission and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, and resolution 53/211 of 18 December 1998 on the financing of the Observer Mission,

    Reaffirming that the costs of the Observer Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

    Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Observer Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Observer Mission,

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Observer Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

    1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission and the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola as at 30 April 1999, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 144.9 million United States dollars, representing 12 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Verification Mission to the period ending 30 June 1997 and from the inception of the Observer Mission to the period ending 30 June 1999, notes that some 6 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

    2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

    3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

    4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Verification Mission and the Observer Mission in full and on time;

    5.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;2

    6.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the liquidation of the Observer Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;
    
    7.	Expresses concern that the Secretary-General did not submit a report before the second part of the resumed fifty-third session of the General Assembly on the status of implementation of measures taken or initiated to address appropriately the issues, observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services3 and other related actions taken by the Observer Mission and the Secretariat, as requested in paragraph 9 of Assembly resolution 52/8 C of 26 June 1998 and in paragraph 8 of its resolution 53/211, and requests the Secretary-General to submit that report no later than 30 June 1999;

    8.	Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola the amount of 7,441,540 dollars gross (7, 083,840 dollars net) for the liquidation of the Observer Mission for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, inclusive of the amount of 369,153 dollars for the support account for peacekeeping operations and the amount of 72,387 dollars for the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, to be apportioned, as an ad hoc arrangement, among Member States in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of its resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the General Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996, 51/218 A to C of 18 December 1996 and 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and 50/451 B of 23 December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the years 1999 and 2000, as set out in its resolution 52/215 A of 22 December 1997;

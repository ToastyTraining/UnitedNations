	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Third Committee (A/51/619/Add.2)]


51/89.Respect for the right to universal freedom of travel and the vital importance of family reunification


	The General Assembly,

	Reaffirming that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,

	Recalling the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 

	Stressing that, as stated in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development,2 family reunification of documented migrants is an important factor in international migration, and that remittances by documented migrants to their countries of origin often constitute a very important source of foreign exchange and are instrumental in improving the well-being of relatives left behind,

	Recalling its resolution 50/175 of 22 December 1995,

	1.	Once again calls upon all States to guarantee the universally recognized freedom of travel to all foreign nationals legally residing in their territory;


	2.	Reaffirms that all Governments, particularly those of receiving countries, must recognize the vital importance of family reunification and promote its incorporation into national legislation in order to ensure protection of the unity of families of documented migrants;

	3.	Calls upon all States to allow, in conformity with international legislation, the free flow of financial remittances by foreign nationals residing in their territory to their relatives in the country of origin;

	4.	Also calls upon all States to refrain from enacting, and to repeal if it already exists, legislation intended as a coercive measure that discriminates against individuals or groups of legal migrants by adversely affecting family reunification and the right to send financial remittances to relatives in the country of origin;

	5.	Decides to continue its consideration of this question at its fifty-second session under the item entitled "Human rights questions".

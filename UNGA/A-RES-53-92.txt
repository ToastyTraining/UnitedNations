53/92.The causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa, which was submitted to the Security Council and the General Assembly,1

	Noting with appreciation the steps taken by the Security Council for an urgent and concerted effort to follow up the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General in the areas of conflict prevention and the maintenance of international peace and security, in accordance with its responsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations as a means of promoting durable peace and sustainable development in Africa,

	Taking note of the decision of the Economic and Social Council2 to undertake substantive discussions on the implementation of the relevant recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General at its substantive session of 1999, and to coordinate and harmonize, as appropriate, the work of the organs of the United Nations system in the implementation of the initiatives on African development,


	Recalling the agreement of 15 November 1965 on cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, as updated and signed on 9 October 1990 by the Secretary-General of the United Nations and the Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity, as well as subsequent resolutions,

	Recognizing that many African countries have made significant progress towards the creation of an enabling environment for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and outcomes of United Nations Conferences,

	Noting with interest the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community,3 which entered into force in May 1994, by which African countries have committed themselves to the promotion of regional economic cooperation and integration to accelerate the process of economic growth and development,

	Stressing the close linkage between peace, security and sustainable development,

	Noting with deep concern the conflicts in Africa and the increasing incidence of atrocities involving civilian populations, in particular those that target women, children and relief workers, and the use of children as combatants,

	Also noting the need to adhere to international humanitarian law and human rights instruments and the fact that all parties involved in the conflict are accountable for their actions,

	Expressing concern about the serious impact of such socio-economic problems and challenges as increasing poverty, the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome pandemic, and barriers that perpetuate discrimination against women and girls,

	Noting with appreciation all international, regional and bilateral initiatives for the development of Africa, including the Tokyo Agenda for Action,4 adopted by the Second Tokyo International Conference on African Development, held at Tokyo from 19 to 21 October 1998, which calls upon the international community to reaffirm its commitment to support Africa's development,

	1.	Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa1 for its holistic approach to the problems of peace and development in Africa and the concrete recommendations contained therein;

	2.	Commends the Secretary-General for his strong and global advocacy for African development and his efforts to mobilize the international community further in support of the continent, and, in particular, to bring the United Nations system, including the Bretton Woods institutions, to support African development within a coordinated framework;

	3.	Notes that the effective implementation of the recommendations of the Secretary-General on building durable peace and promoting sustainable development in Africa will require increased and sustained political will by African States and the international community;

	4.	Calls upon African countries to continue their efforts to create an enabling domestic environment for sustainable development;

	5.	Calls upon the international community to provide African countries with a substantial increase in the flow of financial resources required to implement the recommendations of the Secretary-General effectively, and in that context also calls upon all parties concerned to cooperate in improving the quality and effectiveness of development assistance from all sources;

	6.	Stresses the importance of improved coordination among relevant bodies and agencies of the United Nations system in assisting with post-conflict peace-building, reconciliation, reconstruction and development in Africa, and requests the Secretary-General to seek further measures in this regard;

	7.	Urges the United Nations and other relevant international institutions, upon request from Governments, to provide adequate assistance for the strengthening of the institutions for the promotion of transparency and accountability in public administration and good governance and, in this regard, urges all Governments to promote and respect all human rights and the rule of law and to strengthen democratic institutions;

	8.	Urges all States, as well as other relevant actors, to rely upon peaceful means instead of military solutions to their problems and, to that end, to promote preventive diplomacy and confidence-building measures, as appropriate, and strengthen Africa's capacity to participate in all aspects of peacekeeping operations, in particular through increased cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity and between the United Nations and subregional organizations;

	9.	Calls upon the international community to supplement national efforts by providing African countries with sufficient concessional resources for capacity-building and the attainment of a substantial and sustained pace of economic growth and development;

	10.	Strongly underlines the importance of an enabling environment for investment, in particular, foreign direct investment, market access, good governance, increase in the volume and effectiveness of official development assistance, tackling unsustainable debt burdens, including through debt conversion measures, flexibility in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative and support for regional cooperation and integration as priority areas that need to be addressed in order to achieve sustainable development in all African countries and to encourage the participation of all African countries in the global economy, as recommended in the report of the Secretary-General;

	11.	Encourages African countries to continue to promote regional economic cooperation and integration in the framework of the Treaty establishing the African Economic Community3 and other complementary subregional organizations and arrangements, and calls upon the international community to support these efforts;


	12.	Requests all Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to pay particular attention to meeting the special needs of refugee women and children, including those with special protection needs, as well as internally displaced persons;

	13.	Supports the recommendation to harmonize current international and bilateral initiatives on Africa contained in the report of the Secretary-General, and invites African countries and their partners during the coordination segment of the 1999 substantive session of the Economic and Social Council to identify and rank priorities in partnership, to define respective responsibilities and to agree on realistic and measurable targets in priority areas;

	14.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit a progress report on the implementation of the recommendations contained in his report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session;

	15.	Requests the President of the General Assembly, in preparation for the discussion at the fifty-fourth session of the General Assembly, to establish an open-ended ad hoc working group of the General Assembly to monitor the implementation of the present resolution and, in particular, the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council and the General Assembly on the causes of conflict and the promotion of durable peace and sustainable development in Africa; in this regard, the Working Group shall determine its mandate and modalities, taking into account the outcome of the deliberations of the Economic and Social Council on this matter.

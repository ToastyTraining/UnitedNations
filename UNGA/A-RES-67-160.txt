Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 20 December 2012
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/67/457/Add.1)]
67/160.	Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocol thereto


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its previous relevant resolutions, the most recent of which was resolution 66/229 of 24 December 2011, as well as relevant resolutions of the Human Rights Council, the Commission for Social Development and the Commission on Human Rights,
	Welcoming the fact that, since the opening for signature of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities1 and the Optional Protocol thereto2 on 30 March 2007, 154 States and 1 regional integration organization have signed and 126 States have ratified or acceded to and 1 regional integration organization has formally confirmed the Convention and 91 States have signed and 76 States have ratified or acceded to the Optional Protocol,
	Noting that, while the Convention has enjoyed a very high level of ratification in a short time, the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities currently meets for only one one-week session and one two-week session per year, and noting that, in particular cases, members of the Committee may require reasonable accommodation, as defined in the Convention,
	Noting also that document and translation costs for the reports of States parties constitute the largest part of the budget for the Committee,
	Recalling its resolutions 66/254 of 23 February 2012 and 66/295 of 17 September 2012 on the intergovernmental process of the General Assembly on strengthening and enhancing the effective functioning of the human rights treaty body system, and recognizing in this regard that a long-term solution to the problem of the increasing number of reports of States parties to the Convention can be found in this context,
	1.	Calls upon those States that have not yet done so to consider signing and ratifying the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities1 and the Optional Protocol thereto2 as a matter of priority;
	2.	Welcomes the holding of the fifth session of the Conference of States Parties to the Convention from 12 to 14 September 2012;
	3.	Also welcomes the work of the Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and encourages sustained efforts by the Committee to improve the efficiency of its working methods;
	4.	Encourages States parties to adhere to the page limit established by the Committee for reports of States parties, and notes that this would reduce the operating costs of the Committee;
	5.	Authorizes for the Committee, without prejudice to the intergovernmental process of the General Assembly on strengthening and enhancing the effective functioning of the human rights treaty body system, two annual pre-sessional working group meetings of one week each, starting in 2014, with the participation of up to six members of the Committee, to be held after the two annual sessions of the Committee, in order to ensure the most efficient and effective use of its annual session time by allowing time for the consideration of additional reports;
	6.	Also authorizes for the Committee, without prejudice to the intergovernmental process of the General Assembly on strengthening and enhancing the effective functioning of the human rights treaty body system, the addition of two weeks of meeting time per year to the existing regular sessions, starting in 2014;
	7.	Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General3 and the activities undertaken in support of the Convention;
	8.	Encourages the Inter-Agency Support Group on the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities to continue its work to mainstream the Convention throughout the United Nations system through its Strategy and Plan of Action, approved in 2010, and calls upon the Department of Economic and Social Affairs of the Secretariat and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue strengthening their cooperation in this regard;
	9.	Invites the Secretary-General to intensify efforts to assist States to become parties to the Convention and the Optional Protocol thereto, including by providing assistance with a view to achieving universal adherence;
	10.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue the progressive implementation of standards and guidelines for the accessibility of facilities and services of the United Nations system, taking into account relevant provisions of the Convention, in particular when undertaking renovations, including interim arrangements;
	11.	Also requests the Secretary-General to take further actions to promote the rights of persons with disabilities in the United Nations system in accordance with the Convention, including the retention and recruitment of persons with disabilities;
	12.	Requests United Nations agencies and organizations, and invites intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, to continue to strengthen efforts undertaken to disseminate accessible information on the Convention and the Optional Protocol thereto, including to children and young people to promote their understanding, and to assist States parties in implementing their obligations under those instruments;
	13.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session a report on the status of the Convention and the Optional Protocol thereto and on the implementation of the present resolution.

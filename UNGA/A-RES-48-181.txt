Also requests the Secretary-General to study, within the scope of the implementation of the present resolution and while continuing the existing cooperation with relevant international institutions and entities,  possible areas of economic and technical cooperation among countries with economies in transition, as well as with the developing countries, identifying the role that the United Nations system could play in this field, with a view to encouraging greater participation by those countries in the world economy;

	4.	Further requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session, and biennially thereafter, a report on the implementation of the present resolution.

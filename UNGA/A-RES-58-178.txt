	Reiterating the importance of the Declaration, and stressing the importance of its wide dissemination,
	Recalling all previous resolutions on this subject, in particular its resolution 57/209 of 18 December 2002 and Commission on Human Rights resolution 2003/64 of 24 April 2003,1

	Welcoming the cooperation between the Special Representative and other special procedures of the Commission on Human Rights,
	Welcoming also regional initiatives for the promotion and protection of human rights and the cooperation between international and regional mechanisms for the protection of human rights defenders, and encouraging further development in this regard,
	Recalling that the primary responsibility for promoting and protecting human rights rests with the State, and noting with deep concern that the activities of some non-State actors pose a major threat to the security of human rights defenders,
	Emphasizing the need for strong and effective measures for the protection of human rights defenders,

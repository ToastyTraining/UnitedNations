	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[without reference to a Main Committee (A/51/L.73 and Add.1)]


51/230.Cooperation between the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons


	The General Assembly,

	Noting that the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction1  (opened for signature at Paris on 13 January 1993) entered into force on 29 April 1997, and whereby the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons was established,

	Recognizing the need to establish an appropriate relationship between the United Nations and the organization,

	Considering it essential to the prompt and effective functioning of the organization that its inspectors be able to use the United Nations laissez-passer as an official travel document,

	1.	Invites the Secretary-General to take steps to conclude with the Director-General of the Technical Secretariat of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons an agreement between the United Nations and the organization to regulate the relationship between the two organizations, to be applied provisionally upon signature, pending the completion of procedures necessary for its entry into force, and to present the negotiated draft relationship agreement to the General Assembly for its approval;


	2.	Authorizes the Secretary-General, pending the conclusion of the relationship agreement, to enter with the Director-General of the Technical Secretariat of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, as a matter of urgency, into a temporary arrangement, concerning the issuance of the United Nations laissez-passer to members of the organization's inspection teams, to be used as a valid travel document, where such use is recognized by States parties to the Convention.

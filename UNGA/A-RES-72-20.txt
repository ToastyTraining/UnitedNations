	Recalling also its resolution 35/142 B of 12 December 1980, which introduced the United Nations system for the standardized reporting of military expenditures, its resolutions 48/62 of 16 December 1993, 49/66 of 15 December 1994, 51/38 of 10 December 1996 and 52/32 of 9 December 1997, in which the General Assembly called upon all Member States to participate in the system, and its resolution 47/54 B of 9 December 1992, in which the Assembly endorsed the guidelines and recommendations for objective information on military matters and invited Member States to provide the Secretary-General with relevant information regarding their implementation, 
	Noting that, since then, national reports on military expenditures and on the guidelines and recommendations for objective information on military matters have been submitted by a number of Member States belonging to different geographical regions,
	Convinced that the improvement of international relations forms a sound basis for promoting further openness and transparency in all military matters, 
	Convinced also that transparency in military matters is an essential element for building a climate of trust and confidence between States worldwide and that a better flow of objective information on military matters can help to relieve international tension and is therefore an important contribution to conflict prevention, 
	Noting the role of the standardized reporting system, as instituted through its resolution 35/142 B, as an important instrument to enhance transparency in military matters, 
	Conscious that the value of the standardized reporting system would be enhanced by a broader participation of Member States, 
	Noting that a periodic review of the United Nations Report on Military Expenditures could facilitate its further development and maintain its continued relevance and operation, and recalling that, in its resolution 66/20, the General Assembly recommended the establishment of a process for periodic reviews,

	Recalling also the report of the Group of Governmental Experts on the Operation and Further Development of the United Nations Standardized Instrument for Reporting Military Expenditures on further ways and means to implement the guidelines and recommendations for objective information on military matters, including, in particular, on how to strengthen and broaden participation in the standardized reporting system,2
	Welcoming the work of the Secretariat on migrating data submitted on military expenditures to its new, interactive web platform, which includes an online reporting feature, thus increasing user-friendliness and facilitating the submission of reports,3 in accordance with resolution 66/20, 
	Noting the efforts of several regional organizations to promote transparency of military expenditures, including standardized annual exchanges of relevant information among their member States, 
	Emphasizing the continuing importance of the Report on Military Expenditures under the current political and economic circumstances, 
	Recalling that, in its resolution 66/20, the General Assembly recommended that, for the purpose of reporting by Member States of their national military expenditures in the framework of the Report on Military Expenditures, "military expenditures" be commonly understood to refer to all financial resources that a State spends on the uses and functions of its military forces and information on military expenditures represents an actual outlay in current prices and domestic currency,

	Recalling also Security Council resolution 858 (1993) of 24 August 1993, by which the Council decided to establish the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended        the mandate of the Observer Mission, the most recent of which was resolution 1036 (1996) of 12 January 1996,

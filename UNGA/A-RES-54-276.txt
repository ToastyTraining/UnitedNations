54/276.   Financing of the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti

    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti, the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti and the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti1 and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

    Bearing in mind Security Council resolutions 1063 (1996) of 28 June 1996, by which the Council established the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti, and 1086 (1996) of 5 December 1996, by which the Council extended the mandate of the Mission until 31 July 1997,

    Bearing in mind also Security Council resolution 1123 (1997) of 30 July 1997, by which the Council established the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti for a single four-month period,

    Bearing in mind further Security Council resolutions 1141 (1997) of 28 November 1997, by which the Council established the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti, and 1277 (1999) of 30 November 1999, by which the Council continued the Mission until 15 March 2000,

    Recalling its resolution 51/15 A of 4 November 1996 on the financing of the Support Mission and its subsequent decisions and resolutions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 53/222 B of 8 June 1999,


    Reaffirming that the costs of the Missions are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations, 

    Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Missions, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti by certain Governments,

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to continue to provide the account of the Missions with the necessary financial resources to enable them to meet their outstanding liabilities,

    1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti, the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti and the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti as at 30 April 2000, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 23 million United States dollars, representing 24 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Support Mission to the period ending 30 June 2000, notes that some 29 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding contributions;

    2.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

    3.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursements to troop contributors that bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

    4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti in full;

    5.	Expresses concern at the delay experienced by the Secretary-General in deploying and providing adequate resources to some recent peacekeeping missions, in particular those in Africa;

    6.	Emphasizes that all future and existing peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements;

    7.	Also emphasizes that all peacekeeping missions shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates;


    8.	Takes note of the observations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;3

    9.	Decides that Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Civilian Police Mission shall be credited their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 3,707,700 dollars gross (3,435,600 dollars net) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1999;

    10.	Decides also that, for Member States that have not fulfilled their obligations to the Civilian Police Mission, their share of the unencumbered balance of 3,707,700 dollars gross (3,435,600 dollars net) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1999 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations;

    11.	Emphasizes that no peacekeeping mission shall be financed by borrowing funds from other active peacekeeping missions;

    12.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-fifth session the item entitled "Financing of the United Nations Support Mission in Haiti, the United Nations Transition Mission in Haiti and the United Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti".

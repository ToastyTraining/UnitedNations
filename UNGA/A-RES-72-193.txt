	Recalling also that in its resolution 70/175 it decided to extend the scope of Nelson Mandela International Day, observed each year on 18 July,1 to be also utilized in order to promote humane conditions of imprisonment, to raise awareness about prisoners being a continuous part of society and to value the work of prison staff as a social service of particular importance, and to that end invited Member States, regional organizations and organizations of the United Nations system to celebrate the occasion in an appropriate manner,
	Recalling further that in the same resolution it invited the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to consider, at its upcoming sessions, reconvening the Expert Group for the purpose of identifying the lessons learned, the means to continue to exchange good practices and the challenges faced in the practical application of the Nelson Mandela Rules,
	Recalling its resolution 71/188 of 19 December 2016, entitled "Human rights in the administration of justice", in which it welcomed the adoption of the Nelson Mandela Rules, recognized the importance of the principle that, except for those lawful limitations demonstrably necessitated by the fact of incarceration, persons deprived of their liberty shall retain their non-derogable human rights and all other human rights and fundamental freedoms, and recalled that the social rehabilitation and reintegration of persons deprived of their liberty shall be among the essential aims of the criminal justice system, ensuring, as far as possible, that offenders are able to lead a law-abiding and self-supporting life upon their return to society,

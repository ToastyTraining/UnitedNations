Resolution adopted by the General Assembly
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/57/549)]
57/180.	Improvement of the status of women in the United Nations system


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling Articles 1 and 101 of the Charter of the United Nations, as well as Article 8, which provides that the United Nations shall place no restrictions on the eligibility of men and women to participate in any capacity and under conditions of equality in its principal and subsidiary organs, 
	Recalling also the goal, contained in the Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women,1 of achieving overall gender equality, particularly at the Professional level and above, by 2000 and the further actions and initiatives set out in the outcome document adopted by the General Assembly at its special session entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century",2
	Recalling further its resolution 56/127 of 19 December 2001,
	Taking note of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2002/50 of 23 April 2002 on integrating the human rights of women throughout the United Nations system,3 in particular paragraph 14, in which the Commission recognized that gender mainstreaming would strongly benefit from the enhanced and full participation of women, including at the higher levels of decision-making in the United Nations system,
	Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General on women, peace and security4 and the open debate held in the Security Council on 25 July 2002 on women and peace and security,5
	Taking into account the continuing lack of representation or underrepresentation of women from certain countries, in particular from developing countries, including least developed countries and small island developing States, and from countries with economies in transition, 
	Noting with appreciation those departments and offices that have achieved the goal of gender balance, as well as those departments that have met or exceeded the goal of 50 per cent in the selection of women candidates for vacant posts in the past year, 
	Welcoming the 4 per cent increase in the number of women at the D-2 level, which brings the proportion of women at that level to 22.3 per cent, but expressing concern that at other senior levels of the Secretariat the proportion of women has decreased overall since 1998 to only 10.5 per cent of Under-Secretaries-General and 12.5 per cent of Assistant Secretaries-General,
	Expressing concern that only one of the fifty-one special representatives and envoys of the Secretary-General is a woman, and expressing regret that the number of women heading United Nations agencies has been halved, from six to three, and also that the percentage of women assigned to peace operations has decreased,
	Taking note of the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services of the Secretariat on possible discrimination due to nationality, race, sex, religion and language in recruitment, promotion and placement,6
	Concerned at the finding of the Office of Internal Oversight Services that the proportion of women separating from the Organization increased from 42 per cent in 1998 to 48 per cent in 2001, that at most levels women are reappointed less frequently than men, and that at these rates the Organization is unlikely to meet its gender parity target without concerted efforts to recruit females and retain the female staff currently employed,
	Noting that the statistics on the representation of women in some organizations of the United Nations system are not fully up to date,
	1.	Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General7 and the actions described therein;
	2.	Regrets that the goal of 50/50 gender distribution was not met by the end of 2000, and urges the Secretary-General to redouble his efforts to realize significant progress towards this goal in the near future;
	3.	Reaffirms the urgent goal of achieving 50/50 gender distribution in all categories of posts within the United Nations system, especially at senior and policy-making levels, with full respect for the principle of equitable geographical distribution, in conformity with Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations, and also taking into account the continuing lack of representation or underrepresentation of women from certain countries, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition;
	4.	Expresses concern that in four departments and offices of the Secretariat women still account for less than 30 per cent of staff, and encourages the Secretary-General to intensify his efforts to meet the goal of gender balance within all departments and offices of the Secretariat;
	5.	Welcomes:
	(a)	The ongoing personal commitment of the Secretary-General to meeting the goal of gender equality and his assurance that gender balance will be given the highest priority in his continuing efforts to bring about a new management culture in the Organization;

	(d)	The decision, within the context of the new staff selection system,9 to hold heads of departments and offices accountable for meeting the gender targets in departmental human resource action plans through their performance compacts;

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General, in order to achieve and maintain the goal of 50/50 gender distribution with full respect for the principle of equitable geographical distribution, in conformity with Article 101, paragraph 3, of the Charter:
	(a)	To continue to develop innovative recruitment strategies to identify and attract suitably qualified women candidates, particularly from and in developing countries and countries with economies in transition and other Member States that are unrepresented or underrepresented in the Secretariat, and in occupations in which women are underrepresented;

	(d)	To strongly encourage heads of departments and offices to continue selecting female candidates when their qualifications are the same as, or better than, those of male candidates, and to effectively encourage, monitor and assess the performance of managers in meeting targets for improving women's representation;

	(g)	To intensify his efforts to create, within existing resources, a gender-sensitive work environment supportive of the needs of his staff, both women and men, by, inter alia, actively pursuing appropriate work/life policies, such as flexible working time, flexible workplace arrangements, career development and childcare and elder-care needs, and by providing more comprehensive information to prospective candidates and new recruits on employment opportunities for spouses, providing support for the activities of women's networks and organizations within the United Nations system and expanding gender-sensitivity training in all departments, offices and duty stations;
	(h)	To continue to work to further strengthen the policy against harassment, including sexual harassment, by, inter alia, ensuring the full implementation of the guidelines for its application at Headquarters and in the field, including in peacekeeping operations, and further requests the early issuance of the directive on sexual harassment prepared by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of the Secretariat for use in peacekeeping and other field missions, as well as user-friendly guidelines on sexual harassment to be prepared for the United Nations system by the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women and the inter-agency working group;
	(i)	To undertake further analysis of the probable causes of the slow advance in the improvement of the status of women in the United Nations system, as outlined in paragraph 56 of his report,7 to institute remedial measures and to report on progress made in this context to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session;
	7.	Strongly encourages the Secretary-General to renew his efforts to appoint more women as special representatives and envoys to pursue good offices on his behalf, especially in matters related to peacekeeping, peace-building, preventive diplomacy and economic and social development, as well as in operational activities, and to appoint more women as resident coordinators and to other high-level positions;
	8.	Encourages the Secretary-General and the executive heads of the organizations of the United Nations system to continue to develop common approaches for retaining women, promoting inter-agency mobility and improving career development opportunities;

	10.	Strongly encourages Member States:
	(a)	To support the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies to achieve the goal of 50/50 gender distribution, especially at senior and policy-making levels, by identifying and regularly submitting more women candidates for appointment to positions in the United Nations system, by identifying and proposing national recruitment sources that will assist the organizations of the United Nations system in identifying suitable women candidates, in particular from developing countries and countries with economies in transition, and by encouraging more women to apply for positions within the Secretariat, the specialized agencies, funds and programmes and the regional commissions, including in areas in which women are underrepresented, such as peacekeeping, peace-building and other non-traditional areas;

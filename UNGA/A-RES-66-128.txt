	The General Assembly,
	Recalling all of its previous resolutions on violence against women migrant workers and those adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women, the Commission on Human Rights and the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, and the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women,1
	Reaffirming the provisions concerning women migrant workers contained in the outcome documents of the World Conference on Human Rights,2 the International Conference on Population and Development,3 the Fourth World Conference on Women4 and the World Summit for Social Development5 and their reviews,
	Welcoming the establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), and expressing the hope that it will robustly support national efforts to increase women's access to economic opportunities, especially for those who are most excluded, including women migrant workers, and to end violence against women migrant workers, in the light of the UN-Women strategic plan, 2011-2013,6 which has among its six goals increasing women's access to economic opportunities, and preventing violence against women and girls and expanding access to survivor services, and the policy and programmatic work of UN-Women on empowering women migrant workers, 
	Welcoming also the agreed conclusions adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women during its fifty-fifth session,7 and taking note, in particular, of the commitment, as appropriate, to implement gender-sensitive policies and programmes for women migrant workers, to ensure that all women, including care workers, are legally protected against violence and exploitation, to provide safe and legal channels that recognize women migrant workers' skills and education and fair labour conditions, and to facilitate their productive employment and decent work and integration into the labour force,
	Recalling the discussions during the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, held on 14 and 15 September 2006, which recognized, inter alia, the need for special protection for migrant women, and noting that another high-level dialogue on the same theme will be held in 2013,
	Welcoming the adoption of Convention No. 189 and Recommendation No. 201 on decent work for domestic workers by the International Labour Conference on 16 June 2011, at its one-hundredth session, noting the importance of the early entry into force of Convention No. 189 and encouraging States to consider ratifying it, encouraging States parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women8 to take note of and consider general recommendation No. 26 on women migrant workers adopted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in November 2008,9 and encouraging States parties to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families10 to take note of and consider general comment No. 1 on migrant domestic workers adopted by the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families in December 2010,11 acknowledging that they are complementary and mutually reinforcing,
	Recognizing the increasing participation of women in international migration, driven in large part by socioeconomic factors, and that this feminization of migration requires greater gender sensitivity in all policies and efforts related to the subject of international migration,
	Stressing the shared responsibility of all stakeholders, in particular countries of origin, transit and destination, relevant regional and international organizations, the private sector and civil society, in promoting an environment that prevents and addresses violence against women migrant workers, including in the context of discrimination, through targeted measures, and in this regard recognizing the importance of joint and collaborative approaches and strategies at the national, bilateral, regional and international levels, 
	Recognizing that women migrant workers are important contributors to social and economic development, through the economic and social impacts, as a result of their work, on countries of origin and destination, and underlining the value and dignity of their labour, including the labour of domestic workers, 
	Recognizing also the particular vulnerability of women and their children at all stages of the migration process, extending from the moment of deciding to migrate, and including transit, engagement in formal and informal employment, and integration into the host society, as well as during their return to and reintegration in their countries of origin,
	Expressing deep concern at the continuing reports of grave abuses and violence committed against migrant women and girls, including gender-based violence, in particular sexual violence, domestic and family violence, racist and xenophobic acts, abusive labour practices, exploitative conditions of work, and contemporary forms of slavery, including all forms of forced labour, and trafficking in persons,
	Recognizing that the intersection of, inter alia, gender, age, class and ethnic discrimination and stereotypes can compound the discrimination faced by women migrant workers, and that gender-based violence is a form of discrimination,
	Reaffirming the commitment to protect and promote the human rights of all women, including, without discrimination, indigenous women who migrate for work, and in this regard noting the attention paid in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples12 to the elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination against indigenous women, as appropriate,
	Noting that the priority theme of the fifty-sixth session of the Commission on the Status of Women will be "The empowerment of rural women and their role in poverty and hunger eradication, development and current challenges",13 and in this regard recognizing the role and contribution of rural women migrant workers towards poverty eradication and development in their communities,
	Concerned that many migrant women who are employed in the informal economy and in less skilled work are especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, underlining in this regard the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants so as to prevent and address abuse and exploitation, and observing with concern that many women migrant workers take on jobs for which they may be overqualified and in which, at the same time, they may be more vulnerable because of poor pay and inadequate social protection,
	Emphasizing the need for objective, comprehensive and broad-based information, including sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics, and gender-sensitive indicators for research and analysis, and a wide exchange of experience and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of targeted policies and concrete strategies to specifically address violence against women migrant workers, including in the context of discrimination,
	Realizing that the movement of a significant number of women migrant workers may be facilitated and made possible by means of fraudulent or irregular documentation and sham marriages with the object of migration, that this may be facilitated through, inter alia, the Internet and that those women migrant workers are more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation,
	Recognizing the importance of exploring the link between migration and trafficking in persons in order to further efforts towards protecting women migrant workers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse,
	Encouraged by some measures adopted by some countries of destination to alleviate the plight of women migrant workers residing in their areas of jurisdiction and to promote access to justice, such as the establishment of gender-sensitive protection mechanisms for migrant workers, facilitating their access to mechanisms for reporting complaints or providing assistance during legal proceedings,
	Underlining the important role of relevant United Nations treaty bodies in monitoring the implementation of human rights conventions, and the relevant special procedures, within their respective mandates, in addressing the problem of violence against women migrant workers and in protecting and promoting their human rights and welfare,

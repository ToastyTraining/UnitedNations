48/66.Scientific and technological developments and their impact on international security

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling that at its tenth special session, the first special session devoted to disarmament, it unanimously stressed the importance of both qualitative and quantitative measures in the process of disarmament,

	Recognizing that scientific and technological developments can have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needs to be maintained and encouraged,

	Noting with concern the potential in technological advances for application to military purposes, which could lead to more sophisticated weapons and new weapon systems,

	Stressing the interests of the international community in the subject and the need to follow closely the scientific and technological developments that may have a negative impact on the security environment and on the process of arms limitation and disarmament, and to channel scientific and technological developments for beneficial purposes,

	Emphasizing that the proposal contained in its resolution 43/77 A of 7 December 1988 is without prejudice to research and development efforts being undertaken for peaceful purposes,

	Noting the results of the United Nations Conference on New Trends in Science and Technology:  Implications for International Peace and Security, held at Sendai, Japan, from 16 to 19 April 1990, 1/ and recognizing, in this regard, the need for the scientific and policy communities to work together in dealing with the complex implications of technological change,

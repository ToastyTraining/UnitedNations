[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/67/502/Add.1)]
67/238.	Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses 
of the United Nations
	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its previous resolutions and decisions on the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations, including its resolutions 55/5 B and C of 23 December 2000, 57/4 B of 20 December 2002, 58/1 B of 23 December 2003, 61/237 of 22 December 2006 and 64/248 of 24 December 2009, 
	Reaffirming Article 17 of the Charter of the United Nations and rule 160 of its rules of procedure, 
	Recalling paragraphs 5 and 6 of its resolution 58/1 B, 
	Having considered the reports of the Committee on Contributions on its seventy-first1 and seventy-second2 sessions and the report of the Secretary-General on multi-year payment plans,3 
	1.	Reaffirms that the determination of the scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of the United Nations shall remain the prerogative of the General Assembly; 
	2.	Also reaffirms the fundamental principle that the expenses of the Organization shall be apportioned broadly according to capacity to pay; 
	3.	Further reaffirms the obligation of all Member States to bear the expenses of the United Nations, as apportioned by the General Assembly, in conformity with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations; 
	4.	Reaffirms that the Committee on Contributions as a technical body is required to prepare the scale of assessments strictly on the basis of reliable, verifiable and comparable data; 
	5.	Decides that the scale of assessments for the period from 2013 to 2015 shall be based on the following elements and criteria: 
	(a)	Estimates of gross national income; 
	(b)	Average statistical base periods of three and six years; 
	(c)	Conversion rates based on market exchange rates, except where that would cause excessive fluctuations and distortions in the income of some Member States, when price-adjusted rates of exchange or other appropriate conversion rates should be employed, taking due account of its resolution 46/221 B of 20 December 1991; 
	(d)	The debt-burden approach employed in the scale of assessments for the period from 2010 to 2012; 
	(e)	A low per capita income adjustment of 80 per cent, with a threshold per capita income limit of the average per capita gross national income of all Member States for the statistical base periods; 
	(f)	A minimum assessment rate of 0.001 per cent; 
	(g)	A maximum assessment rate for the least developed countries of 0.01 per cent; 
	(h)	A maximum assessment rate of 22 per cent; 
	6.	Notes that the application of the current methodology, as set out above, reflects changes in the relative economic situations of the States Members of the United Nations; 
	7.	Also notes that changes in Member States' shares in world gross national income result in changes in relative capacity to pay, which should be more accurately reflected in the scale of assessments;
	8.	Recognizes that the current methodology can be enhanced, bearing in mind the principle of capacity to pay; 
	9.	Also recognizes the need to study the methodology in depth and in an effective and expeditious manner, taking into account the views expressed by Member States; 
	10.	Requests the Committee on Contributions, in accordance with its mandate and the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, to review and make recommendations on the elements of the methodology of the scale of assessments in order to reflect the capacity of Member States to pay, and to report thereon to the Assembly by the main part of its seventieth session; 
	11.	Resolves that the scale of assessments for the contributions of Member States to the regular budget of the United Nations for 2013, 2014 and 2015 shall be as follows:

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/53/485/Add.2)]


	53/219.  Integrated Management Information System

    The General Assembly,

    Recalling its resolution 52/212 B of 31 March 1998,

    Reaffirming its resolution 52/227 of 31 March 1998 and section VII of its resolution 53/214 of 18 December 1998,

    Having considered the tenth progress report of the Secretary-General and the addendum thereto,1 the study of the Integrated Management Information System conducted by independent experts,2 the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,3 and the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the increase in costs of the Integrated Management Information System development contract,4


    1.	Takes note with concern of the findings contained in the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the increase in costs of the Integrated Management Information System development contract,4 in particular that:

    (a)	With careful planning, proper identification of needs and more adequate preparations, the cost increase could have been reduced;

    (b)	Delays in promptly addressing deficiencies through concerted action in each phase of the development and implementation process have led the Organization to place undue reliance on the contractor;

    (c)	Insufficient progress has been made with respect to long-term operational support, software maintenance and staff training functions and, consequently, the reliance on the Integrated Management Information System project team and perhaps even the contractor is unlikely to diminish in the near future;

    (d)	There is no assurance that implementation problems similar to those experienced in previous years will not recur in the case of remaining releases, resulting in the possibility of further cost escalations;

    2.	Notes the observations of the Office of Internal Oversight Services that in large and complex software development contracts some out-of-scope work is a common occurrence;

    3.	Regrets the lack of adequate participation of the main user departments in the development and implementation phases of the system, which led to increased costs;

    4.	Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the institutionalization of the Integrated Management Information System by the main user departments is completed as soon as possible;

    5.	Reiterates its deep concern about the time and cost overruns for the completion of the project;

    6.	Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that problems similar to those experienced previously do not recur;

    7.	Notes that the services required from the main contractor will be completed by the end of 1999, with the exception of warranty-related activities;

    8.	Encourages the Secretary-General to make use of any potential for improving efficiency by streamlining existing work flows and processes through more effective use of the Integrated Management Information System;

    9.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all corrective measures required to make the system fully operational and avoid further delays and unnecessary cost increases in the implementation of the project, taking into account the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services4 and the study conducted by independent experts;2

    10.	Decides that the resources required to conclude the development of the Integrated Management Information System by August 2000 shall not exceed 77.6 million United States dollars;


    11.	Reiterates the need for a comprehensive programme for Integrated Management Information System training to be included as part of the ongoing training programme offered to staff at all duty stations concerned;

    12.	Requests the Secretary-General to include information on the implementation of paragraphs 3 and 4 of its resolution 52/212 B in future progress reports on the Integrated Management Information System;

    13.	Also requests the Secretary-General clearly to establish roles, responsibilities and accountability of all offices and staff concerned in the implementation of the remaining releases and to report thereon in his next progress report;

    14.	Further requests the Secretary-General to maintain an effective monitoring system to ensure that implementation problems are addressed properly as they arise;

    15.	Decides to approve an additional appropriation of 3.2 million dollars under section 27D, Support services, of the programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999, to be charged to the contingency fund and to be reflected in the assessment to be determined on the basis of the final appropriation for the biennium 1998-1999.

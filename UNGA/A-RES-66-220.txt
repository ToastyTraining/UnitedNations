	Recalling further the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action,12 the Declaration of the World Food Summit: five years later,13 including the goal of achieving food security for all through an ongoing effort to eradicate hunger in all countries, with an immediate view to reducing by half the number of undernourished people no later than 2015, as well as the commitment to achieving the goals set out in paragraph 19 of the United Nations Millennium Declaration,14
	Acknowledging the work undertaken by the High-level Task Force on the Global Food Security Crisis,
	Welcoming the outcome of the thirty-seventh session of the Committee on World Food Security, held in Rome from 17 to 22 October 2011, 
	Noting the ongoing process of developing principles for responsible agricultural investment that respects rights, livelihoods and resources, as well as the inclusive process for the development of voluntary guidelines on the responsible governance of tenure of land, fisheries and forests in the context of national food security, 
	Reiterating that the multiple and complex causes of the global food crisis in developing countries, especially for net food importers, and its consequences for food security and nutrition require a comprehensive and coordinated response in the short, medium and long terms by national Governments and the international community, and remaining concerned that high and excessively volatile food prices pose a serious challenge to the fight against poverty and hunger and to the efforts of developing countries to attain food security and nutrition and to achieve the objective of reducing by half the number of undernourished people no later than 2015, as well as other internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, 
	Recalling the agreement to keep under regular review, by the Ministerial Conference and appropriate organs of the World Trade Organization, the impact of the results of the Uruguay Round on the least developed countries as well as on the net food-importing developing countries, with a view to fostering positive measures to enable them to achieve their development objectives, and in this regard calls for the implementation of the Marrakesh Decision on Measures Concerning the Possible Negative Effects of the Reform Programme on Least Developed and Net Food-Importing Developing Countries,15
	Stressing the need to increase investment in agriculture and rural development, including through international cooperation, with a view to increasing the agricultural production of developing countries, many of which have become net food importers,
	Welcoming national, regional and international initiatives and commitments aimed at improving food security and nutrition,
	Recalling the commitments made to achieve global food security and provide adequate and predictable resources through bilateral and multilateral channels, including the financial and policy commitments set out in the Aquila Food Security Initiative,
	Recognizing the importance of an enabling international and national environment to increase and sustain investment in the agriculture sector of developing countries and to create a more level playing field in agriculture through greater market access, a substantial reduction in trade-distorting domestic support and the parallel elimination of all forms of export subsidies and disciplines on all export measures with equivalent effect in accordance with the mandate from the Doha Work Programme of the World Trade Organization,16
	Recognizing also that agriculture plays a crucial role in addressing the needs of a growing global population and is inextricably linked to poverty eradication, especially in developing countries, and stressing that integrated and sustainable agriculture and rural development approaches are therefore essential to achieving enhanced food security in an environmentally sustainable way, 
	Recognizing further the importance and positive role of smallholder farmers, including women, cooperatives and indigenous and local communities in developing countries, and their knowledge and practices, in the preservation, conservation and sustainable use of traditional crops and biodiversity for present and future generations as an important contribution to the achievement of food security, as well as in the implementation of development goals in such fields as employment policy, social integration, regional and rural development, agriculture and environmental protection,

	Expressing concern that the number of people living in extreme poverty and hunger has reached nearly one billion, which is an unacceptable blight on the lives, livelihoods and dignity of many of the world's people, mostly in developing countries, and noting that the effects of long-standing underinvestment in food security, agriculture and rural development have recently been further exacerbated by the food, financial and economic crises, among other factors, 
	Remaining deeply concerned about starvation and the humanitarian disaster on an unimaginable scale being faced by millions of people in the Horn of Africa, 
	Expressing concern about the negative impact of high and excessively volatile food prices on food security and nutrition, particularly on the poor and people in vulnerable situations, which has undermined the prospect of developing countries for economic growth and poverty alleviation, including the goal to halve the proportion of people who suffer from hunger by 2015,

	15.	Urges Member States and international organizations to pursue policies and strategies that improve the functioning of domestic, regional and international markets and ensure equitable access for all to those markets, especially smallholder and women farmers in developing countries, notes the importance of non-trade-distorting special measures that are consistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization aimed at creating incentives for smallholder farmers in developing countries to enable them to increase their productivity and to compete on a more equal footing in world food markets, and urges Member States to refrain from taking measures that are inconsistent with the rules of the World Trade Organization and that have adverse impacts on global, regional and national food security; 
	16.	Stresses that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system will promote agriculture and rural development in developing countries and contribute to world food security, and urges national, regional and international strategies to promote the participation of farmers, especially smallholder farmers, including women, in community, domestic, regional and international markets;

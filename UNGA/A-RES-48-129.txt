	6.	Requests the Secretary-General and Member States to ensure that appropriate additional resources from within the existing and future regular budgets of the United Nations are accorded to the Centre to enable it to carry out, in full and on time, the mandates contained in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action without diverting resources from development programmes and activities of the United Nations;

	7.	Also requests the Secretary-General to submit an interim report to the Commission on Human Rights at its fiftieth session and a final report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session on the strengthening of the Centre and on the measures taken to implement the present resolution.

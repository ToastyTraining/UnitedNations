	Noting that the sixth meeting of the Global Forum on Migration and Development, held in Port Louis on 21 and 22 November 2012, drew together the outcomes of several preparatory meetings, focusing on the overarching theme "Enhancing the development of migrants and their contribution to the development of communities and States" as a contribution to promoting international cooperation among States and between States and other actors in order to strengthen the capacity of States to address migration and development opportunities and challenges more effectively,
	Recognizing the cultural and economic contributions made by migrants to receiving societies and their communities of origin, as well as the need to identify appropriate means of maximizing development benefits and responding to the challenges that migration poses to countries of origin, transit and destination, especially in the light of the impact of the financial and economic crisis, and committing to ensuring dignified, humane treatment with applicable protections and to strengthening mechanisms for international cooperation,

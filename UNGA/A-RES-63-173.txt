	The General Assembly,
	Recalling that the purposes and principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations include promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all,
	Recalling also its resolution 60/251 of 15 March 2006, in which it decided that the Human Rights Council should, inter alia, promote human rights education and learning as well as advisory services, technical assistance and capacity-building,
	Recalling further the 2005 World Summit Outcome, in which Heads of State and Government expressed their support for the promotion of human rights education and learning at all levels, including through the implementation of the World Programme for Human Rights Education, as appropriate, and encouraged all States to develop initiatives in that regard,1
	Recalling its resolution 62/171 of 18 December 2007, by which it proclaimed the year commencing on 10 December 2008 the International Year of Human Rights Learning,

	Recognizing human rights learning as encompassing the acquisition and internalization of knowledge and understanding of one's own and others' human dignity,

	Acknowledging that civil society, academia, the private sector, where appropriate, and parliamentarians can play an important role at the national, regional and international levels in the promotion and protection of human rights, including in the development of ways and means to promote and implement learning about human rights as a way of life at the community level,

Urges Member States to develop throughout the International Year of Human Rights Learning and beyond, in coordination with civil society, the private sector, academia and parliamentarians and regional organizations, including the appropriate specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system, international strategies and/or regional, national and local programmes of action aimed at broad-based and sustained human rights learning at all levels, bearing in mind the complementary efforts undertaken within the framework of the World Programme for Human Rights Education;2
	3.	Calls upon the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Human Rights Council to support, cooperate and collaborate with civil society, the private sector, academia, regional organizations and other relevant stakeholders, as well as with organizations, programmes and funds of the United Nations system, in efforts to develop, in particular, the design of international strategies and/or regional, national and local programmes of action aimed at broad-based and sustained human rights learning for all, including seminars and workshops for community leaders, keeping in mind a long-term multi-year process involving several countries in all regions;

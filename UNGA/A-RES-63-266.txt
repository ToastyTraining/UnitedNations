	9.	Notes that the preliminary estimates provided by the Secretary-General for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011 do not include provisions for the implementation of those requirements that are under discussion by the General Assembly and that the requirements pertinent to the regular budget should be reflected in the programme budget for the biennium 2010-2011, subject to approval by the Assembly and in accordance with its resolutions 41/213 of 19 December 1986 and 42/211 of 21 December 1987;

	14.	Emphasizes that the proposed programme budget outline should be submitted sufficiently early in order to be able to serve as a practical tool in the budget preparation process, and, in this regard, requests the Secretary-General to issue future budget outlines at least thirty days prior to their scheduled introduction, but no later than 15 November of the off-budget year;

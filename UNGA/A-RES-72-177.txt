	Noting the conclusions and recommendations of the expert workshops organized by the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and contained in the Rabat Plan of Action on the prohibition of advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, adopted in Rabat on 5 October 2012,4
	Considering that religion or belief, for those who profess either, is one of the fundamental elements in their conception of life and that freedom of religion or belief, as a universal human right, should be fully respected and guaranteed,

	Emphasizing that States, regional organizations, national human rights institutions, non-governmental organizations, religious bodies, the media and civil society as a whole have an important role to play in promoting tolerance and respect for religious and cultural diversity and in the universal promotion and protection of human rights, including freedom of religion or belief,

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Second Committee (A/54/585/Add.3 and Corr.1)]


54/199.	Specific actions related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries

    The General Assembly,

    Recalling the provisions of its resolutions 44/214 of 22 December 1989, 46/212 of 20 December 1991, 48/169 of 21 December 1993, 50/97 of 20 December 1995 and 52/183 of 18 December 1997 and the Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation between Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and the Donor Community,1 as well as the relevant parts of the Agenda for Development,2

    Recognizing that the lack of territorial access to the sea, aggravated by remoteness and isolation from world markets, and prohibitive transit costs and risks impose serious constraints on the overall socio-economic development efforts of the landlocked developing countries,

    Recognizing also that sixteen of the landlocked developing countries are also classified by the United Nations as least developed countries and that their geographical situation is an added constraint on their overall ability to cope with the challenges of development,


    Recognizing further that most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems, including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector,

    Noting the importance of continuing to strengthen the existing international support measures with a view to addressing further the problems of landlocked developing countries,

    Emphasizing the importance of further strengthening effective and close cooperation and collaboration between landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours, at regional, subregional and bilateral levels, inter alia, through cooperative arrangements in developing efficient transit transport systems in landlocked and transit developing countries, and noting the important role of the activities of the regional commissions in this regard,

    Welcoming the holding of the fourth Meeting of Governmental Experts from Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Representatives of Donor Countries and Financial and Development Institutions, in New York from 24 to 26 August 1999,

    Expressing its appreciation to donor partners for participating in the fourth Meeting of Governmental Experts and for the generous contribution that facilitated the participation of landlocked developing countries,

    1.	Welcomes the note by the Secretary-General transmitting the progress report of the secretariat of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development on specific actions related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries;3

    2.	Also welcomes the agreed conclusions and recommendations for future action adopted by the fourth Meeting of Governmental Experts from Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Representatives of Donor Countries and Financial and Development Institutions;4

    3.	Reaffirms the right of access of landlocked countries, including landlocked developing countries, to and from the sea and freedom of transit through the territory of transit States by all means of transport, in accordance with international law;

    4.	Also reaffirms that transit countries, in the exercise of their full sovereignty over their territory, have the right to take all measures necessary to ensure that the rights and facilities provided for landlocked countries, including landlocked developing countries, in no way infringe upon their legitimate interests;


    5.	Calls upon the landlocked developing countries and their transit neighbours to implement measures to strengthen further their cooperative and collaborative efforts to deal with transit transport issues, including bilateral and, as appropriate, subregional cooperation, inter alia, by improving the physical infrastructure and non-physical aspects of transit transport systems, strengthening and concluding, where appropriate, bilateral and subregional agreements to govern transit transport operations, developing joint ventures in the area of transit transport and strengthening institutions and human resources dealing with transit transport, and, in this respect, notes that South-South cooperation also plays an important role in this field;

    6.	Appeals once again to all States, international organizations and financial institutions to implement, as a matter of urgency and priority, the specific actions related to the particular needs and problems of landlocked developing countries agreed upon in the resolutions and declarations adopted by the General Assembly, the outcomes of recent major United Nations conferences relevant to landlocked developing countries and the Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation between Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and the Donor Community1 and to take fully into account the agreed recommendations and conclusions of the fourth Meeting of Governmental Experts from Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Representatives of Donor Countries and Financial and Development Institutions;

    7.	Welcomes the continuing efforts being made by the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in collaboration with donor countries and institutions, in particular the United Nations Development Programme, the regional commissions and relevant subregional institutions, to organize specific consultative groups, as appropriate, when requested by the landlocked and transit developing countries concerned, to identify priority areas for action at the national and subregional levels and draw up action programmes;

    8.	Invites donor countries, the United Nations Development Programme and multilateral financial and development institutions to provide landlocked and transit developing countries with appropriate financial and technical assistance in the form of grants or concessional loans for the construction, maintenance and improvement of their transport, storage and other transit-related facilities, including alternative routes and improved communications, and to promote subregional, regional and interregional projects and programmes, and, in this regard, also to consider, inter alia, improving the availability and optimal use of the different transport modes and intermodal efficiency along transport corridors;

    9.	Emphasizes that assistance for the improvement of transit transport facilities and services should be integrated into the overall economic development strategies of the landlocked and transit developing countries and that donor assistance should consequently take into account the requirements for the long-term restructuring of the economies of the landlocked developing countries;

    10.	Notes the important role that the simplification, harmonization and standardization of transit procedures and documentation as well as the application of information technologies have played in enhancing the efficiency of transit systems, and calls upon the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in cooperation with other relevant organizations of the United Nations system, to continue to assist landlocked and transit developing countries in these areas, in accordance with their mandates;

    11.	Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations to convene in 2001, within the overall level of resources for the biennium 2000-2001, another meeting of governmental experts from landlocked and transit developing countries and representatives of donor countries and financial and development institutions, including relevant regional and subregional economic organizations and commissions, to review progress in the development of transit transport systems, including sectoral aspects and transit transportation costs, with a view to exploring the possibility of formulating necessary action-oriented measures;


    12.	Requests the fifth Meeting of Governmental Experts from Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and Representatives of Donor Countries and Financial and Development Institutions to consider a proposal made at the fourth Meeting to convene in 2003 a ministerial meeting on transit transport issues so as to give appropriate emphasis to the problems of landlocked and transit developing countries;

    13.	Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to seek voluntary contributions to ensure the participation of representatives of landlocked and transit developing countries at the meeting referred to in paragraph 11 above;

    14.	Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to formulating international policies and measures dealing with the special problems of landlocked developing countries, inter alia, through technical cooperation programmes, and urges the Conference, inter alia, to keep under constant review the evolution of transit transport infrastructure facilities, institutions and services, monitor the implementation of agreed measures, inter alia, by means of a case study as necessary, promote regional and subregional cooperation, build up consensus on cooperative arrangements, mobilize international support measures, collaborate in all relevant initiatives, including those of the private sector and non-governmental organizations, and serve as a focal point for cross-regional issues of landlocked developing countries;

    15.	Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations, in consultation with the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to take appropriate measures for the effective implementation of the activities called for in the present resolution, and to provide, in accordance with resolution 52/183, the Office of the Special Coordinator for Least Developed, Landlocked and Island Developing Countries of  the Conference with adequate resources so as to allow it to implement effectively its mandate to continue to support landlocked developing countries;

    16.	Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations, together with the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to prepare a report on the implementation of the present resolution and submit it to the Trade and Development Board and to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session.

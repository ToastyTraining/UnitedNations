    Recognizing that the overall thrust of the new strategic vision for the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat) and its emphasis on two global campaigns, concerning secure tenure and urban governance, are strategic points of entry for effective implementation of the Habitat Agenda,

    Reaffirming the role of the Centre as focal point for the implementation of the Habitat Agenda and the need for the Centre adequately to perform this role through the active mobilization and broadening of its network of United Nations, governmental and non-governmental partners,

    1.	Calls upon all relevant United Nations organizations and specialized agencies to take initiatives and continue with their specific actions towards the implementation of the Habitat Agenda;1

    2.

    3.	Invites the United Nations coordinator system to strengthen its support to the implementation of the Habitat Agenda through, inter alia, assistance in the implementation of national local plans of action based on the full involvement of local authorities and partners from civil society;

    4.	Calls upon all Member States to initiate preparations for reporting on in-country implementation of the Habitat Agenda, in line with the recommendations by the Commission on Human Settlements as described in its resolution 17/1 of 14 May 1999,3 with a view to contributing fully to the preparatory process for the special session of the General Assembly to be held in the year 2001 for an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of the Habitat Agenda, including the strengthening and activation, wherever necessary, of national coordination mechanisms, inclusive of local authorities and civil society partners, along the models pioneered at the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II);

    5.

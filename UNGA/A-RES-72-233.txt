	12.	Remains deeply concerned that, while the prevalence of extreme poverty continues its decades-long descent, progress has been uneven, 1.6 billion people still live in multidimensional poverty, the total number of persons living in extreme poverty remains unacceptably high and the non-income dimensions of poverty and deprivation, such as access to quality education or basic health services, and relative poverty remain major concerns; 
	13.	Recognizes the urgent need to address poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, hunger, malnutrition and food insecurity, which will lead to rich payoffs across the Sustainable Development Goals, and encourages the international community to enhance international cooperation and to devote resources to developing rural and urban areas and sustainable agriculture and fisheries and to supporting smallholder farmers, especially women farmers, herders and fishers in developing countries, particularly in the least developed countries;

	16.	Emphasizes the importance of an outcome from the Second Decade, and that, while the centrality of employment and decent jobs to the eradication of poverty is well recognized, employment growth has not been sufficient to absorb the growing labour force, especially in those countries and regions with large youth populations; 
	17.	Notes with concern the continuing high levels of unemployment and underemployment, inter alia, among young people, including young women in particular, recognizes that decent work for all remains one of the best routes out of poverty, and in this regard invites donor countries, multilateral organizations and other development partners to continue to assist Member States, in particular developing countries, in adopting policies consistent with the Global Jobs Pact adopted by the International Labour Conference at its ninety-eighth session as a general framework within which each country can formulate policy packages specific to its situation and national priorities in order to promote a job-intensive recovery and sustainable development;

	26.	Stresses the importance of taking targeted measures to eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, of implementing nationally appropriate social protection systems and measures for all, including social protection floors, and of achieving substantial coverage of the poor and the vulnerable, and encourages Member States to continue to develop and implement social protection floors based on national priorities, paying particular attention to women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities; 
	27.

	28.	Emphasizes the reference in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to the need to ensure the significant mobilization of financial and non-financial resources from a variety of sources, including through enhanced development cooperation, as well as regional, subregional and interregional cooperation, in order to provide predictable means for all developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, to implement programmes and policies to end poverty in all its forms and dimensions; 
	29.	Stresses that the achievement of sustainable development and the eradication of poverty also hinge on the ability and readiness of countries to effectively mobilize domestic resources, attract foreign direct investment, fulfil official development assistance (ODA) commitments and use ODA effectively, and facilitate the transfer of technology, on mutually agreed terms, to developing countries, and also stresses that the resolution of unsustainable debt situations is critical for heavily indebted poor countries, while remittances have become a significant source of income and finance for receiving economies and their contribution to the achievement of sustainable development; 
	30.	Recognizes that the Addis Ababa Action Agenda provides a global framework for financing sustainable development and is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports and complements it and helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with concrete policies and actions, which relate to domestic public resources, domestic and international private business and finance, international development cooperation, international trade as an engine for development, debt and debt sustainability, addressing systemic issues and science, technology, innovation and capacity-building, and data, monitoring and follow-up;

	35.	Welcomes the progress on financial inclusion across all income groups and all regions in recent years, while being concerned that 2 billion people, primarily in rural areas in developing countries, still do not have access to formal financial services and remaining concerned about the gender gap in financial inclusion; 
	36.	Notes that an important use of international public finance, including ODA, is to catalyse additional resource mobilization from other sources, public and private, and through appropriately designed risk-sharing instruments, including co-investments, public-private partnerships and guarantees, and also notes that it can support improved tax collection, help to strengthen domestic enabling environments and build essential public services and can also be used to unlock additional finance through blended or pooled financing and risk mitigation, notably for infrastructure and other investments that support private sector development; 
	37.	Emphasizes that international public finance plays an important role in complementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited domestic resources; 
	38.

	39.	Welcomes the increase of ODA in real terms in 2016, but expresses its concern that bilateral net ODA to the least developed countries fell slightly in real terms in 2016, after increases in 2015, and that many countries still fall short of their respective ODA commitments, reiterates that the fulfilment of all ODA commitments remains crucial and that, for many least developed countries and landlocked developing countries, ODA remains the largest source of external financing, commends those few countries that have met or surpassed their commitment to 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance (ODA/GNI) and the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to the least developed countries, and urges all other countries to step up efforts to increase their ODA and to make additional concrete efforts towards the ODA targets, welcomes the decision by the European Union reaffirming its collective commitment to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of ODA/GNI within the time frame of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and undertaking to meet collectively the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to the least developed countries in the short term and to reach 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to the least developed countries within the time frame of the 2030 Agenda, and encourages ODA providers to consider setting a target to provide at least 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to the least developed countries; 
	40.	Also welcomes the increasing efforts to improve the quality of ODA and to increase its development impact, recognizes the Development Cooperation Forum of the Economic and Social Council, notes other initiatives, such as the high-level forums on aid effectiveness, which produced, inter alia, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the Accra Agenda for Action25 and the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, which make important contributions to the efforts of the countries that have made commitments to them, including through the adoption of their fundamental principles, and bears in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all formula that will guarantee effective assistance and that the specific situation of each country needs to be fully considered; 
	41.	Recognizes that the decline in ODA to the least developed countries during the past years was a worrisome trend and that the level of 0.09 per cent of gross national income attained in 2014 remained below the relevant 0.15 to 0.20 per cent target to which many developed countries have committed, and notes, in that context, the 4 per cent real-term increase in bilateral ODA to the least developed countries in 2015 and the projection that the proportion of ODA to those countries will continue to rise in 2016-2019, suggesting that developed countries are reversing the decline in ODA to the least developed countries; 
	42.	Encourages all relevant stakeholders, as appropriate, to strengthen United Nations funding for the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, through voluntary contributions to existing poverty-related system-wide funds; 
	43.	Acknowledges the complexity of the challenge of poverty eradication, and in this regard emphasizes that, in accelerating poverty eradication, the organizations of the United Nations development system must be driven by national priorities, with the development of national capacities in developing countries continuing to be a core area of focus, and operate in an integrated, coordinated and coherent manner, through development programmes and projects that address poverty eradication as their underlying objective, within their respective mandates, in order to ensure that gains are irreversible, making full use of the interlinked and mutually reinforcing pillars of the United Nations development system, and encourages the use of diverse strategies; 
	44.	Reiterates the need to strengthen the leadership role of the United Nations in promoting international cooperation for development, and recognizes the role of the specialized agencies and United Nations funds and programmes and regional commissions, including the International Labour Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization, the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Children's Fund, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia, the Economic Commission for Africa, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean and the Economic Commission for Europe, in contributing to international advocacy for eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including through education and training; 
	45.	Calls upon the organizations of the United Nations development system, including the funds and programmes and the specialized agencies, in accordance with their mandates, to assign the highest priority to poverty eradication, and stresses that efforts in this area should be scaled up to address the root causes of extreme poverty and hunger; 
	46.	Calls upon the relevant organizations of the United Nations system, within their respective mandates and resources, to support Member States, at their request, in strengthening their macroeconomic policy capacity and national development strategies; 
	47.	Encourages greater inter-agency convergence and collaboration within the United Nations system in sharing knowledge, promoting policy dialogue, facilitating synergies, mobilizing funds, providing technical assistance in the key policy areas underlying the decent work agenda and strengthening system-wide policy coherence on employment issues, including by avoiding the duplication of efforts; 
	48.	Calls upon the relevant organizations of the United Nations system, within their respective mandates and resources, to ensure that no one is left behind and no country is left behind in the implementation of the present resolution; 
	49.	Urges the international community, including the United Nations system, to implement the outcome documents relating to the internationally agreed development goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, as established by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals, and the means of implementation, including the Addis Ababa Action Agenda; 
	50.	Stresses that the impacts of natural disasters, climate change, conflicts and major outbreaks of disease are severely hampering efforts to achieve poverty eradication, in particular in developing countries, and calls upon the international community to give priority to addressing them; 
	51.	Recognizes the importance of addressing the diverse needs of and challenges faced by countries in special situations, in particular African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, as well as the specific challenges facing many middle-income countries, and therefore requests the United Nations development system, the international financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders to ensure that these diverse and specific development needs are appropriately considered and addressed, in a tailored fashion, in their relevant strategies and policies, with a view to promoting a coherent and comprehensive approach towards individual countries; 
	52.	Invites all States, organizations of the United Nations system, intergovernmental organizations concerned and interested national organizations, including non-governmental organizations, to consider organizing activities for the celebration in 2018 of the twenty-sixth anniversary of the declaration by the General Assembly, in its resolution 47/196 of 22 December 1992, of 17 October as the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, in order to raise public awareness to promote the eradication of poverty and extreme poverty in all countries, and in this regard recognizes the useful role that the observance of the International Day continues to play in raising public awareness and mobilizing all stakeholders in the fight against poverty and promoting the active participation of those living in extreme poverty in the design and implementation of programmes and policies which affect them, with the aim of achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; 
	53.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its seventy-third session a report that details the response of the United Nations system to the theme of the Third Decade, includes an inter-agency, system-wide plan of action for poverty eradication to coordinate the efforts of the United Nations system, and contains recommendations concerning how to make the Third United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2018-2027) effective, in support of the poverty eradication-related internationally agreed development goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, utilizing, as appropriate, existing expertise and poverty-related follow-up mechanisms and processes; 
	54.	Considers that the theme of the Third Decade, to be reviewed at the seventy-third session of the General Assembly, shall be "Accelerating global actions for a world without poverty" in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development; 
	55.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventy-third session, under the item entitled "Eradication of poverty and other development issues", a sub-item entitled "Implementation of the Third United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2018-2027)", unless otherwise agreed.

	Noting that considerable progress has been achieved in developing and applying the latest information technologies and  means of telecommunication,

	Considering that it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources or technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes,
	Noting the contribution of those Member States that have submitted their assessments on issues of information security to the Secretary-General pursuant to paragraphs 1 to 3 of resolutions 53/70, 54/49, 55/28 and 56/19,

	Confirming the request to the Secretary-General contained in paragraph 4 of its resolution 56/19,

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 17 December 2007
[on the report of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee
(Fourth Committee) (A/62/403)]
62/101.	Recommendations on enhancing the practice of States and international intergovernmental organizations in registering space objects


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies1 (Outer Space Treaty), in particular articles VIII and XI,
	Recalling also the Convention on Registration of Objects Launched into Outer Space,2 
	Recalling further its resolution 1721 B (XVI) of 20 December 1961,
	Recalling its resolution 41/66 of 3 December 1986,
	Taking note of the relevant parts of the report of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space on its fiftieth session3 and the report of the Legal Subcommittee on its forty-sixth session, in particular the conclusions of the Working Group on the Practice of States and International Organizations in Registering Space Objects, annexed to the report of the Legal Subcommittee,4 
	Noting that nothing in the conclusions of the Working Group or in the present resolution constitutes an authoritative interpretation of or a proposed amendment to the Registration Convention,
	Bearing in mind the benefits for States of becoming parties to the Registration Convention and that, by acceding to, implementing and observing the provisions of the Registration Convention, States:
	(a)	Enhance the utility of the Register of Objects Launched into Outer Space established under article III of the Registration Convention, in which information furnished by States and international intergovernmental organizations conducting space activities that have declared their acceptance of the rights and obligations under the Registration Convention is recorded;
	(b)	Benefit from additional means and procedures that assist in the identification of space objects, including, in particular, in accordance with article VI of the Registration Convention,
	Noting that States parties to the Registration Convention and international intergovernmental organizations conducting space activities, having declared their acceptance of the rights and obligations under the Convention, shall furnish information to the Secretary-General in accordance with the Convention and shall establish an appropriate registry and inform the Secretary-General of the establishment of such a registry in accordance with the Convention,
	Considering that universal accession to and acceptance, implementation and observance of the provisions of the Registration Convention:
	(a)	Lead to increased establishment of appropriate registries;
	(b)	Contribute to the development of procedures and mechanisms for the maintenance of appropriate registries and the provision of information to the Register of Objects Launched into Outer Space;
	(c)	Contribute to common procedures, at the national and international levels, for registering space objects with the Register;
	(d)	Contribute to uniformity with regard to the information to be furnished and recorded in the Register concerning space objects listed in the appropriate registries;
	(e)	Contribute to the receipt of and recording in the Register of additional information concerning space objects on the appropriate registries and information on objects that are no longer in Earth orbit,
	Noting that changes in space activities since the Registration Convention entered into force include the continuous development of new technologies, an increase in the number of States carrying out space activities, an increase in international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space and an increase in activities carried out by non-governmental entities, as well as partnerships formed by non-governmental entities from more than one country,
	Desirous of achieving the most complete registration of space objects,
	Desirous also of enhancing adherence to the Registration Convention,
	1.	Recommends, with regard to adherence to the Registration Convention,2 that:
	(a)	States that have not yet ratified or acceded to the Registration Convention should become parties to it in accordance with their domestic law and, until they become parties, furnish information in accordance with General Assembly resolution 1721 B (XVI);
	(b)	International intergovernmental organizations conducting space activities that have not yet declared their acceptance of the rights and obligations under the Registration Convention should do so in accordance with article VII of the Convention;
	2.	Also recommends, with regard to the harmonization of practices, that:
	(a)	Consideration should be given to achieving uniformity in the type of information to be provided to the Secretary-General on the registration of space objects, and such information could include, inter alia:
	(i)	The Committee on Space Research international designator, where appropriate;
	(ii)	Coordinated Universal Time as the time reference for the date of launch;
	(iii)	Kilometres, minutes and degrees as the standard units for basic orbital parameters;
	(iv)	Any useful information relating to the function of the space object in addition to the general function requested by the Registration Convention;
	(b)	Consideration should be given to the furnishing of additional appropriate information to the Secretary-General on the following areas:
	(i)	The geostationary orbit location, where appropriate;
	(ii)	Any change of status in operations (inter alia, when a space object is no longer functional);
	(iii)	The approximate date of decay or re-entry, if States are capable of verifying that information;
	(iv)	The date and physical conditions of moving a space object to a disposal orbit;
	(v)	Web links to official information on space objects;
	(c)	States conducting space activities and international intergovernmental organizations that have declared their acceptance of the rights and obligations under the Registration Convention should, when they have designated focal points for their appropriate registries, provide the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the Secretariat with the contact details of those focal points; 
	3.	Further recommends, in order to achieve the most complete registration of space objects, that:
	(a)	Due to the complexity of the responsibility structure in international intergovernmental organizations conducting space activities, a solution should be sought in cases where an international intergovernmental organization conducting space activities has not yet declared its acceptance of the rights and obligations under the Registration Convention, and a general backup solution should be provided for registration by international intergovernmental organizations conducting space activities in cases where there is no consensus on registration among the States members of such organizations;
	(b)	The State from whose territory or facility a space object has been launched should, in the absence of prior agreement, contact States or international intergovernmental organizations that could qualify as "launching States" to jointly determine which State or entity should register the space object; 
	(c)	In cases of joint launches of space objects, each space object should be registered separately and, without prejudice to the rights and obligations of States, space objects should be included, in accordance with international law, including the relevant United Nations treaties on outer space, in the appropriate registry of the State responsible for the operation of the space object under article VI of the Outer Space Treaty;1
	(d)	States should encourage launch service providers under their jurisdiction to advise the owner and/or operator of the space object to address the appropriate States on the registration of that space object;
	4.	Recommends that, following the change in supervision of a space object in orbit:
	(a)	The State of registry, in cooperation with the appropriate State according to article VI of the Outer Space Treaty, could furnish to the Secretary-General additional information, such as:
	(i)	The date of change in supervision;
	(ii)	The identification of the new owner or operator;
	(iii)	Any change of orbital position;
	(iv)	Any change of function of the space object;
	(b)	If there is no State of registry, the appropriate State according to article VI of the Outer Space Treaty could furnish the above information to the Secretary-General;
	5.	Requests the Office for Outer Space Affairs: 
	(a)	To make available to all States and international intergovernmental organizations a model registration form reflecting the information to be provided to the Office for Outer Space Affairs, to assist them in their submission of registration information;
	(b)	To make public, through its website, the contact details of the focal points;
	(c)	To establish web links on its website to the appropriate registries that are available on the Internet;
	6.	Recommends that States and international intergovernmental organizations should report to the Office for Outer Space Affairs on new developments relating to their practice in registering space objects.

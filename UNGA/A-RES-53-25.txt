	[without reference to a Main Committee (A/53/L.25)]


53/25.International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World (2001-2010)

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 52/15 of 20 November 1997 and Economic and Social Council resolution 1997/47 of 22 July 1997 proclaiming the year 2000 as the International Year for the Culture of Peace,1 as well as its resolution 52/13 of 20 November 1997 on a culture of peace,

	Taking into account Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/54 of 17 April 1998 entitled "Towards a culture of peace",2

	Recalling the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights concerning the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education (1995-2004),

	Taking into account the project of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization entitled "Towards a culture of peace",

	Aware that the task of the United Nations to save future generations from the scourge of war requires transformation towards a culture of peace, which consists of values, attitudes and behaviours that reflect and inspire social interaction and sharing based on the principles of freedom, justice and democracy, all human rights, tolerance and solidarity, that reject violence and endeavour to prevent conflicts by tackling their root causes to solve problems through dialogue and negotiation and that guarantee the full exercise of all rights and the means to participate fully in the development process of their society,


	Recognizing that enormous harm and suffering are caused to children through different forms of violence at every level of society throughout the world and that a culture of peace and non-violence promotes respect for the life and dignity of every human being without prejudice or discrimination of any kind,

	Recognizing also the role of education in constructing a culture of peace and non-violence, in particular the teaching of the practice of peace and non-violence to children, which will promote the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations,

	Emphasizing that the promotion of a culture of peace and non-violence, by which children learn to live together in peace and harmony that will contribute to the strengthening of international peace and cooperation, should emanate from adults and be instilled in children,

	Underlining that the proposed international decade for a culture of peace and non-violence for the children of the world will contribute to the promotion of a culture of peace based on the principles embodied in the Charter and on respect for human rights, democracy and tolerance, the promotion of development, education for peace, the free flow of information and the wider participation of women as an integral approach to preventing violence and conflicts, and efforts aimed at the creation of conditions for peace and its consolidation,

	Convinced that such a decade, at the beginning of the new millennium, would greatly assist the efforts of the international community to foster peace, harmony, all human rights, democracy and development throughout the world,

	1.	Proclaims the period 2001-2010 as the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World;

	2.	Invites the Secretary-General to submit, in consultation with Member States, relevant United Nations bodies and non-governmental organizations, a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session and a draft programme of action to promote the implementation of the Decade at local, national, regional and international levels, and to coordinate the activities of the Decade;

	3.	Invites Member States to take the necessary steps to ensure that the practice of peace and non-violence is taught at all levels in their respective societies, including in educational institutions;

	4.	Calls upon the relevant United Nations bodies, in particular the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund, and invites non-governmental organizations, religious bodies and groups, educational institutions, artists and the media actively to support the Decade for the benefit of every child of the world;

	5.	Decides to consider, at its fifty-fifth session, the question of the International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World (2001-2010), under the agenda item entitled "Culture of peace".

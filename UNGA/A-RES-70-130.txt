	Acknowledging the role of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), including in supporting national efforts, to increase women's access to economic opportunities, including for women migrant workers, and to end violence against them, in the light of the UN-Women strategic plan, 2014-2017,11 which has among its six goals increasing women's access to economic opportunities, and preventing violence against women and girls and expanding access to services for survivors, and acknowledging the policy and programmatic work of UN-Women on empowering women migrant workers,

	Recalling the declaration of the United Nations High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development,15 held on 3 and 4 October 2013, which reaffirmed the need to promote and protect effectively the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, regardless of their migration status, especially those of women and children, and to address international migration through international, regional or bilateral cooperation and dialogue and through a comprehensive and balanced approach, recognizing the roles and responsibilities of countries of origin, transit and destination in promoting and protecting the human rights of all migrants and avoiding approaches that might aggravate their vulnerability,
	Recalling also that the declaration recognized that women and girls account for almost half of all international migrants at the global level and the need to address the special situation and vulnerability of migrant women and girls by, inter alia, incorporating a gender perspective into policies and strengthening national laws, institutions and programmes to combat gender-based violence, including trafficking in persons and discrimination against them, and emphasized in this regard the need to establish appropriate measures for the protection of women migrant workers in all sectors, including those involved in domestic work,
	Taking note with appreciation of the adoption by the International Labour Conference on 16 June 2011, at its 100th session, of the Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189) and Recommendation No. 201 on decent work for domestic workers, of the International Labour Organization, and the entry into force of the Convention on 5 September 2013, and inviting States to consider ratifying it, encouraging States parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women to take note of and consider general recommendation No. 26 on women migrant workers adopted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in November 2008,16 and encouraging States parties to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families17 to take note of and consider general comment No. 1 on migrant domestic workers adopted by the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families in December 2010,18 acknowledging that they are complementary and mutually reinforcing,
	Recognizing the urgency of combating trafficking in persons in all its forms, including for the purposes of forced or compulsory labour, particularly of women migrant workers, and in this regard taking note of the adoption by the International Labour Conference on 11 June 2014, at its 103rd session, of the Protocol to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), and of Recommendation No. 203 on supplementary measures for the effective suppression of forced labour, of the International Labour Organization,
	Recognizing also the increasing participation of women of all skill levels in international migration, driven in large part by socioeconomic factors, and that this feminization of migration requires greater gender sensitivity in all policies and efforts related to the subject of international migration,
	Recognizing further that the demand for migrant care work appears to be rising, where the failure to resolve care deficits and secure public provision of care has increased the demand for care work, particularly in the private sphere, and that some migrant workers engaged in informal care work, particularly women, face serious human rights abuses owing to the invisible nature of their workplace, while many benefit from the economic opportunities offered by care work,
	Recognizing the roles and responsibilities of and need for cooperation among all stakeholders, in particular countries of origin, transit and destination, relevant regional and international organizations, the private sector and civil society, in promoting an environment that prevents and addresses violence against women migrant workers, including in the context of discrimination, through targeted measures, and in this regard recognizing the importance of joint and collaborative approaches and strategies at the national, bilateral, regional and international levels,
	Recognizing also that women migrant workers have the potential to foster equitable, inclusive and sustainable growth and human development through the economic and social impacts, as a result of their work, on countries of origin and destination, and underlining the value and dignity of their labour, including the labour of domestic and care workers,
	Recognizing further the particular vulnerability and needs of women and their children at all stages of the migration process, extending from the moment of deciding to migrate, and including transit, engagement in formal and informal employment and integration into the host society, as well as during their return to and reintegration in their countries of origin,
	Expressing deep concern at the continuing reports of grave abuses and violence committed against migrant women and girls, including gender-based violence, sexual violence, domestic and family violence, racist and xenophobic acts, discrimination, abusive labour practices, exploitative conditions of work and contemporary forms of slavery, inter alia, all forms of forced labour and trafficking in persons,
	Recognizing that one of the key causes of the labour exploitation suffered by migrants, including women migrant workers, is linked to the unscrupulous practices of some recruitment agencies and informal brokers that charge high recruitment fees, and noting with concern the reports of abuse committed by some recruitment agencies and employers,
	Recognizing also that the intersection of, inter alia, gender, age, class, race and ethnic discrimination and stereotypes can compound the discrimination faced by women migrant workers and that gender-based violence is a form of discrimination,
	Reaffirming the commitment to respect, protect and promote the human rights of all women, including, without discrimination, indigenous women who migrate for work, and in this regard noting the attention paid in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples19 to the elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination against indigenous women, as appropriate,
	Noting that the priority theme of the sixtieth session of the Commission on the Status of Women will be "Women's empowerment and its link to sustainable development" and that migration can enable equitable, inclusive and sustainable growth and human development for countries of origin and destination, migrants and their families, and in this regard recognizing the potential role of women migrant workers in contributing to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
	Concerned that many migrant women who are employed in the informal economy and in less skilled work are especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, underlining in this regard the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants so as to prevent and address abuse and exploitation, observing with concern that many women migrant workers take on jobs for which they may be overqualified and in which, at the same time, they may be more vulnerable because of poor pay and inadequate social protection, and in this regard taking note of the adoption by the International Labour Conference on 12 June 2015, at its 104th session, of Recommendation No. 204 concerning the transition from the informal to the formal economy,
	Emphasizing the need for objective, comprehensive and broad-based information, including sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics, and gender- sensitive indicators for research and analysis, and a wide exchange of experience and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of targeted policies and concrete strategies to specifically address violence against women migrant workers, including in the context of discrimination,
	Realizing that the movement of a significant number of women migrant workers may be facilitated and made possible by means of fraudulent or irregular documentation and sham marriages with the object of migration, that this may be facilitated through, inter alia, the Internet and that those women migrant workers are more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation,
	Recognizing the importance of exploring the link between migration and trafficking in persons in order to further efforts towards protecting women migrant workers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse,
	Recognizing also that the vulnerabilities documented for women migrant workers highlight increasingly complex migration contexts and channels, where migrant workers may find themselves in life-threatening situations when entering other countries,
	Encouraged by some measures adopted by some countries of destination to alleviate the plight of women migrant workers residing in their areas of jurisdiction and to promote access to justice, such as the establishment of gender-sensitive protection mechanisms for migrant workers, facilitating their access to mechanisms for reporting complaints or providing assistance during legal proceedings,
	Underlining the important role of relevant United Nations treaty bodies in monitoring the implementation of human rights conventions and of the relevant special procedures, as well as of the supervisory mechanisms of the International Labour Organization in monitoring the implementation of labour rights instruments, within their respective mandates, in addressing the problem of violence against women migrant workers and in protecting and promoting their human rights and welfare,

	3.	Invites Member States to consider ratifying relevant International Labour Organization conventions, including the Migration for Employment Convention (Revised), 1949 (No. 97),22 the Migrant Workers (Supplementary Provisions) Convention, 1975 (No. 143),23 the Private Employment Agencies Convention, 1997 (No. 181)24 and the Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189), and to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families,17 the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,25 the Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,26 the 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons27 and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness,28 as well as all other human rights treaties that contribute to the protection of the rights of women migrant workers, calls upon States parties to comply with their relevant obligations under international law, and also encourages Member States to implement the United Nations Global Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons;29

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Second Committee (A/50/615/Add.1)]


50/126.Water supply and sanitation

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 35/18 of 10 November 1980, by which it proclaimed the period 1981-1990 as the International Drinking Water Supply and Sanitation Decade,

	Recalling also its resolution 45/181 of 21 December 1990, in which it expressed its deep concern about the slow rate of progress in the provision of services in water and sanitation,

	Recalling further its resolution 47/193 of 22 December 1992, in which it declared 22 March of each year World Day for Water,

	Bearing in mind that the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held in Paris from 3 to 14 September 1990, the World Summit for Children, held in New York on 29 and 30 September 1990, the Global Strategy for Shelter to the Year 2000 and the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held at Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June 1992, reiterated the need to provide, on a sustainable basis, access to safe water in sufficient quantities and proper sanitation for all,

	Deeply concerned that at the current rate of progress the provision of drinking water will be insufficient to satisfy the needs of a very large number of people by the year 2000 and that the lack of progress in the provision of basic sanitation services is likely to have dramatic environmental and health consequences in the near future,


	1.	Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on progress made in providing safe water supply and sanitation for all during the first half of the 1990s; 1/

	2.	Takes note of the programme strategies in water and environmental sanitation adopted by the Executive Board of the United Nations Children's Fund at its annual session for 1995 2/ and of resolution AFR/RC 43/R2 of the Regional Committee for Africa of the World Health Organization, in which the Committee endorsed the Africa 2000 initiative for water supply and sanitation in Africa;

	3.	Calls upon Governments to implement fully the provisions concerning water resources in general and water supply and sanitation in particular contained in chapter 18 of Agenda 21, 3/ and the recommendations made by the Commission on Sustainable Development at its second and third sessions, 4/ including the recommendations for action contained in the Action Programme of the Ministerial Conference on Drinking Water and Environmental Sanitation convened by the Government of the Netherlands on 22 and 23 March 1994, 5/ in particular:

	(a)	To develop, review or revise by 1997 and implement, in the context of a national sustainable development strategy consistent with Agenda 21, measures for drinking water supply and environmental sanitation, taking into account the goals set by the World Summit for Children;

	(b)	To undertake, as appropriate, legal, regulatory and institutional reforms designed to bring about the management of water resources at the lowest appropriate level, including stakeholder participation and the involvement of the private sector, and to adopt strategies for capacity-building;

	(c)	To assign high priority to programmes designed to provide basic sanitation and excreta disposal systems to urban and rural areas and to the treatment of waste waters, with provisions for community involvement;


	(d)	To formulate and implement investment strategies and cost-recovery policies aimed at generating a flow of financial resources commensurate with needs, taking into account the needs and conditions of the peri-urban and rural poor;

	(e)	To establish or strengthen a nationwide water and sanitation monitoring system, making full use, as appropriate, of the information support system developed by the Joint Monitoring Programme of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund;

	4.	Calls upon the organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant organizations to intensify their efforts concerning financial and technical support for developing countries and countries with economies in transition;

	5.	Urges donor Governments, multilateral financial and development institutions and non-governmental organizations to give favourable and appropriate consideration to requests for grants and concessional financing,  particularly with regard to environmental sanitation and sewerage and to waste-water treatment projects, which are intended to implement programmes consistent with the provisions and recommendations referred to in paragraph 3 of the present resolution;

	6.	Decides to review at its fifty-fifth session the situation at the end of the 1990s and requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to it, through the Commission on Sustainable Development and the Economic and Social Council, containing an assessment of the water supply and sanitation situation in developing countries, including proposals for action for the ensuing decade at the national and international levels.

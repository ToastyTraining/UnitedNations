Annex
United Nations Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Children in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice

Introduction
1.	The United Nations Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Children in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice have been prepared to help Member States to address the need for integrated strategies for violence prevention and child protection, thereby offering children the protection to which they have an unqualified right.
2.	The Model Strategies and Practical Measures take into consideration the complementary roles of the justice system on the one hand, and the child protection, social welfare, health and education sectors on the other, in creating a protective environment and in preventing and responding to violence against children. They draw attention to the need for Member States to ensure that criminal law is used appropriately and effectively to criminalize various forms of violence against children, including forms of violence prohibited by international law. The Model Strategies and Practical Measures will enable criminal justice institutions to strengthen and focus their efforts to prevent and respond to violence against children, and to increase their diligence in investigating, convicting and rehabilitating perpetrators of violent crimes against children.
3.	The Model Strategies and Practical Measures take into account the fact that children who are alleged as, accused of or recognized as having infringed criminal law, especially those who are deprived of their liberty, face a high risk of violence. Because special attention must be paid to the especially vulnerable situation of these children, the Model Strategies and Practical Measures are aimed at not only improving the effectiveness of the criminal justice system in preventing and responding to violence against children, but also at protecting children against any violence that may result from their contact with the justice system.
4.	The Model Strategies and Practical Measures reflect the fact that some of the perpetrators of violence against children are themselves children and often victims of violence. The need to protect child victims in such instances cannot negate the rights of all of the children involved to have their best interests considered as a matter of primary importance.
5.	The Model Strategies and Practical Measures are grouped into three broad categories: general prevention strategies to address violence against children as part of broader child protection and crime prevention initiatives; strategies and measures to improve the ability of the criminal justice system to respond to crimes of violence against children and to protect child victims effectively; and strategies and measures to prevent and respond to violence against children in contact with the justice system. Good practices are set forth, to be considered and used by Member States within the framework of their national legal systems in a manner consistent with applicable international instruments, including relevant human rights instruments, and taking into consideration relevant United Nations standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. Member States should be guided by the Model Strategies and Practical Measures to the maximum extent of their available resources and, where needed, within the framework of international cooperation.

7.	In implementing the Model Strategies and Practical Measures at the national level, Member States should be guided by the following principles:
	(a)	That the inherent rights of the child to life, survival and development are protected;
	(b)	That the right of the child to have his or her best interests as a primary consideration in all matters involving or affecting him or her is respected, whether the child is a victim or a perpetrator of violence, as well as in all measures of prevention and protection;
	(c)	That every child is protected from all forms of violence without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child's or his or her parent's or legal guardian's race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status;

	(g)	That measures to protect child victims of violence are non-coercive and do not compromise the rights of these children.

Part one
Prohibiting violence against children, implementing broad prevention measures and promoting research and data collection
8.	Child protection should begin with the proactive prevention of violence and the explicit prohibition of all forms of violence. Member States have the duty to take appropriate measures that effectively protect children from all forms of violence.

I.	Ensuring the prohibition by law of all forms of violence against children
9.	Recognizing the importance of the existence of a sound legal framework which prohibits violence against children and empowers authorities to respond appropriately to incidents of violence, Member States are urged, as appropriate and while taking into consideration relevant international human rights instruments, to ensure:
	(a)	That their laws are comprehensive and effective in prohibiting and eliminating all forms of violence against children and that provisions that justify, allow for or condone violence against children or may increase the risk of violence against children are removed;
	(b)	That cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment of children is prohibited and eliminated in all settings, including schools.
10.	Because a countless number of girls and boys fall victim to harmful practices undertaken under different pretexts or grounds, including female genital mutilation or cutting, forced marriage, breast ironing and witchcraft rituals, Member States are urged, as appropriate and while taking into consideration relevant international human rights instruments:
	(a)	To establish by law a clear and comprehensive prohibition of all harmful practices against children, supported by detailed provisions in relevant legislation to secure the effective protection of girls and boys from those practices, to provide means of redress and to fight impunity;
	(b)	To remove from all national legislation any legal provisions that provide justification or allow for consent to harmful practices against children;
	(c)	To ensure that resorting to informal justice systems does not jeopardize children's rights or preclude child victims from accessing the formal justice system, and to establish the supremacy of international human rights law.
11.	Recognizing the serious nature of many forms of violence against children and the need to criminalize these conducts, Member States should review and update their criminal law to ensure that the following acts are fully covered thereunder:
	(a)	Engaging in sexual activities with a child who is under the legal age of consent, ensuring as well that an appropriate "age of protection" or "legal age of consent", below which a child cannot legally consent to sexual activity, is set;
	(b)	Engaging in sexual activities with a child using coercion, force or threats, abusing a position of trust, authority or influence over a child, including within the family, and abusing a particularly vulnerable situation of a child, because of a mental or physical disability or a situation of dependence;
	(c)	Committing sexual violence against a child, including sexual abuse, sexual exploitation and sexual harassment through or facilitated by the use of new information technologies, including the Internet;
	(d)	The sale of or trafficking in children for any purpose and in any form;
	(e)	Offering, delivering or accepting, by whatever means, a child for the purpose of sexual exploitation of the child, transfer of organs of the child for profit or engagement of the child in forced labour;
	(f)	Offering, obtaining, procuring or providing a child for child prostitution;
	(g)	Producing, distributing, disseminating, importing, exporting, offering, selling or possessing child pornography;
	(h)	Slavery or practices similar to slavery, debt bondage and serfdom and forced labour, including forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict;
	(i)	Committing gender-related violence against a child and, in particular, gender-related killing of girls.

II.	Implementing comprehensive prevention programmes
12.	General and context-specific measures should be developed by Member States to prevent violence against children. Prevention measures, building on a growing understanding of factors that give rise to violence against children and addressing the risks of violence to which children are exposed, should be part of a comprehensive strategy to eliminate violence against children. Criminal justice agencies, working together with, as appropriate, child protection, social welfare, health and education agencies and civil society organizations, should develop effective violence prevention programmes as part of both broader crime prevention programmes and initiatives to build a protective environment for children.
13.	Preventing the victimization of children through all available means should be recognized as a crime prevention priority. Member States are therefore urged, as appropriate and while taking into consideration relevant international human rights instruments:
	(a)	To strengthen existing child protection systems and to help to create a protective environment for children;
	(b)	To adopt measures to prevent violence within the family and the community, address cultural acceptance or tolerance of violence against children, including gender-related violence, and challenge harmful practices;
	(c)	To encourage and support the development and implementation at every level of government of comprehensive plans for the prevention of violence against children in all of its forms, based on in-depth analysis of the problem and incorporating:
(i)	An inventory of existing policies and programmes;
(ii)	Well-defined responsibilities for the relevant institutions, agencies and personnel involved in preventive measures;
(iii)	Mechanisms for the appropriate coordination of preventive measures between governmental and non-governmental agencies;
(iv)	Evidence-based policies and programmes that are continually monitored and carefully evaluated in the course of implementation;
(v)	Parental capacity-building and family support as the primary preventive measures, while strengthening child protection in school and in the community;
(vi)	Methods for effectively identifying, mitigating and reducing the risk of violence against children;
(vii)	Public awareness-raising and community involvement in prevention policies and programmes;
(viii)	Close interdisciplinary cooperation, with the involvement of all relevant agencies, civil society groups, local and religious leaders and, where relevant, other stakeholders;
(ix)	Participation of children and families in policies and programmes for the prevention of criminal activities and victimization;
	(d)	To identify the specific vulnerabilities and risks faced by children in different situations and to adopt proactive measures to reduce those risks;
	(e)	To take appropriate actions to support and protect all children, in particular children in different situations of vulnerability and children in need of special protection;
	(f)	To be guided by the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime23 and play a leading role in developing effective crime prevention strategies and in creating and maintaining institutional frameworks for their implementation and review.
14.	The risk of violence against children committed by children should be addressed by specific prevention measures, including measures:
	(a)	To prevent physical, psychological and sexual violence exerted, often through bullying, by children against other children;
	(b)	To prevent the violence sometimes exerted by groups of children, including violence by youth gangs;
	(c)	To prevent the recruitment, use and victimization of children by youth gangs;
	(d)	To identify and protect children, in particular girls, who are linked to gang members and who are vulnerable to sexual exploitation;
	(e)	To encourage law enforcement agencies to use multi-agency intelligence to proactively profile local risk and, accordingly, to direct enforcement and disruption activity.

16.	Broad public education and awareness campaigns are required. Member States, in cooperation with educational institutions, non-governmental organizations, relevant professional associations and the media, are urged, as appropriate and while taking into consideration relevant international human rights instruments:
	(a)	To implement and support effective public awareness and public education initiatives that prevent violence against children by promoting respect for their rights and by educating their families and communities about the harmful impact of violence;
	(b)	To raise awareness of how to prevent and respond to violence against children among persons who have regular contact with children in the justice, child protection, social welfare, health and education sectors and in areas relating to sport, culture and leisure activities;

	(g)	To challenge attitudes that condone or normalize violence against children, including the tolerance and acceptance of corporal punishment and harmful practices, and the acceptance of violence.
17.	In order to address the vulnerability and the specific risks of violence faced by unaccompanied children, migrant children and children who are refugees or asylum seekers, Member States are urged, as appropriate and without prejudice to their obligations under international law:
	(a)	To ensure that these children have access to independent assistance, advocacy and advice, that they are always placed in appropriate accommodation and treated in a manner that is fully compatible with their best interests, that they are separated from adults when necessary to protect them and, when applicable, to sever relationships with smugglers and traffickers, and that a legally appointed representative is available from the moment an unaccompanied child is detected by the authorities;
	(b)	To conduct regular analyses of the nature of the threats faced by these children and to assess their needs for assistance and protection;
	(c)	To uphold the principle of burden-sharing and solidarity with the host country and to enhance international cooperation.

III.	Promoting research and data collection, analysis and dissemination

	(b)	To monitor and publish periodic reports on cases of violence against children reported to the police and other criminal justice agencies, including the number of cases, apprehension or arrest and clearance rates, prosecution and case disposition with regard to the alleged offenders and the prevalence of violence against children and, in so doing, to make use of data derived from population-based surveys. The reports should disaggregate data by type of violence and include, for example, information on the age and sex of the alleged offender and his or her relationship to the victim;
	(c)	To develop a multilevel system of reporting, starting from the most basic unit of government to the national level and to allow, in accordance with national legislation, the exchange of relevant information, statistics and data among all relevant institutions to help to ensure comprehensive data gathering for policy and programme development that will promote child protection;
	(d)	To develop population-based surveys and child-sensitive methodologies aimed at collecting data regarding children, including crime and victimization surveys, to allow for assessment of the nature and extent of violence against children;
	(e)	To develop and implement indicators relating to the performance of the justice system in preventing and responding to violence against children;
	(f)	To develop and monitor indicators relating to the prevalence of violence against children in contact with the justice system;
	(g)	To evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the justice system in meeting the needs of child victims of violence and preventing such violence, including with regard to the way in which the justice system treats child victims of violence, the use it makes of different intervention models and the degree to which it cooperates with other agencies responsible for the protection of children, and also to evaluate and assess the impact of current legislation, rules and procedures relating to violence against children;
	(h)	To collect, analyse and disseminate data on independent inspections of places of detention, access to complaint mechanisms by children in detention and outcomes of complaints and investigations in accordance with the obligations of States under international human rights law;
	(i)	To use research studies and data collection to inform policy and practice and to exchange and disseminate information concerning successful violence prevention practices;
	(j)	To encourage and provide sufficient financial support for research on violence against children;
	(k)	To ensure that data, periodic reports and research are aimed at supporting the efforts of Member States to address violence against children and are used in the framework of constructive cooperation and dialogue with and among Member States.

Part two
Enhancing the ability and capacity of the criminal justice system to respond to violence against children and protect child victims

IV.	Establishing effective detection and reporting mechanisms
19.	In order to respond to the need to detect and report acts of violence against children, Member States are urged, as appropriate:
	(a)	To ensure that measures are taken to identify risk factors for different types of violence and identify signs of actual violence in order to trigger appropriate intervention as early as possible;
	(b)	To ensure that criminal justice professionals who routinely come into contact with children in the course of their work are aware of risk factors and indicators of various forms of violence, in particular at the national level, and that they have received guidance and are trained on how to interpret such indicators and have the knowledge, willingness and ability necessary to take appropriate action, including the provision of immediate protection;

	(e)	To ensure that individuals, and in particular children, reporting in good faith alleged incidents of violence against children are protected against all forms of reprisal;
	(f)	To work with Internet service providers, mobile telephone companies, search engines, public Internet facilities and others to facilitate and, where feasible, enact appropriate legislative measures to ensure the reporting of any representation, by whatever means, of a child engaged in real or simulated explicit sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts of a child for primarily sexual purposes, defined as child pornography under the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography24 to the police or other authorized bodies and the blocking of access to websites where such material is available or the deletion of illegal content, and to keep records, in accordance with the law, and preserve evidence for a period of time and as determined by law for the purpose of investigation and prosecution.

V.	Offering effective protection to child victims of violence
20.	In order to more effectively protect child victims of violence through the criminal justice process and avoid their secondary victimization, Member States are urged, as appropriate and while taking into consideration relevant international human rights instruments, to take appropriate measures:

XVI.	Detecting, assisting and protecting children who are victims of violence as a result of their involvement with the justice system as alleged or sentenced offenders
43.	Given the crucial importance of providing children who report abuse and incidents of violence within the justice system with immediate protection, support and counselling, Member States are urged, as appropriate and while taking into consideration relevant international human rights instruments:
	(a)	To establish complaint mechanisms for child victims of violence within the justice system that are safe, confidential, effective and easily accessible;
	(b)	To ensure that children receive clear information, in particular when they first arrive in a place of detention, both verbally and in writing, about their rights, relevant procedures, how they can exercise their right to be heard and listened to, effective remedies to address incidents of violence and available services for assistance and support, as well as information on seeking compensation for damages, that such information is age- and culturally appropriate and child- and gender-sensitive, and that parents and legal guardians are equally provided with relevant information on these measures;
	(c)	To protect children who report abuse, specifically taking into account the risks of retaliation, including by removing those allegedly implicated in violence against or ill-treatment of children from any position of control or power, whether direct or indirect, over complainants, witnesses and their families, and those conducting the investigation;
	(d)	To take effective measures to protect children who provide information or act as witnesses in proceedings related to a case involving violence within the justice system;
	(e)	To provide access to fair, prompt and equitable redress mechanisms and accessible procedures for seeking and obtaining compensation for child victims of violence in the justice system, and to endeavour to adequately fund victim compensation schemes.
44.	Recognizing the importance of detecting and responding to all incidents of violence against children as a result of their involvement with the justice system as alleged or sentenced offenders, Member States are urged, as appropriate:
	(a)	To ensure that laws establishing obligations to report violence against children in the justice system respect children's rights and are incorporated into the relevant regulations of agencies and rules of conduct, and that all those working with children have clear guidance on reporting requirements and consequences;
	(b)	To implement protection measures for staff who report in good faith alleged incidents of violence against children, and to adopt rules and procedures that protect the identity of professionals and private individuals who bring cases of violence against children to the attention of the competent authorities;
	(c)	To ensure the prompt, independent and effective investigation of all alleged incidents of violence against children involved with the justice system, as alleged or sentenced offenders, by competent and independent authorities, including medical personnel, with full respect for the principle of confidentiality.

XVII.	Strengthening accountability and oversight mechanisms
45.	Member States are urged to take all appropriate measures to combat impunity and the tolerance of violence against children within the justice system, including through awareness-raising programmes, education and effective prosecution of violent offences committed against children within the justice system.
46.	Member States are encouraged to ensure that there is a clear and sustained commitment and obligation at all levels of justice institutions to prevent and address violence against children, including in a child- and gender-sensitive manner.
47.	Member States are urged, as appropriate and while taking into consideration relevant international legal instruments:
	(a)	To promote accountability for incidents of violence against children in the justice system, including by adopting and implementing effective measures to enhance integrity and prevent corruption;
	(b)	To establish internal and external accountability mechanisms in policing and in places of detention;
	(c)	To establish all key elements of an effective accountability system, including independent national oversight, monitoring and complaint mechanisms for agencies dealing with children;

	(f)	To promote transparency and public accountability regarding all measures taken to hold accountable perpetrators of violence and those who are responsible for preventing such violence;
	(g)	To undertake criminal or other public investigations into all serious reports of violence against children at any stage of the justice process, and to ensure that such investigations are carried out by persons of integrity, are adequately funded and are completed without undue delay.

	[on the report of the Third Committee (A/48/628)]

		48/101.United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 47/89 of 16 December 1992 and taking note of Economic and Social Council resolution 1993/33 of 27 July 1993,

	Recalling also its resolution 46/152 of 18 December 1991, in the annex to which it is stated that the contributions of the regional institutes for the prevention of crime and the treatment of offenders to policy development and implementation, and their resource requirements, especially those of the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, should be fully integrated into the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme,

	Aware of the financial difficulties that the Institute continues to face as a result of the fact that many States of the African region are in the category of least developed countries and therefore lack the necessary resources with which to support the Institute,

	Conscious of the efforts made thus far by the Institute in fulfilling its mandate through, inter alia, the organization of training programmes and regional seminars, as well as the provision of advisory services,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General, 1/

	4.	Requests the United Nations Development Programme to continue providing programme support to the Institute;

	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session on the implementation of the present resolution.

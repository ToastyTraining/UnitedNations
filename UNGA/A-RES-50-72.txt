	Having considered the report of the Conference on Disarmament, 1/ and in particular the part concerning expansion of the membership of the Conference,


	Stressing the role of the Conference on Disarmament as the sole multilateral global negotiating body on disarmament,

	Emphasizing the fact that, notwithstanding dramatic changes in the international situation and continuous consultations, there has been no expansion of the membership of the Conference during the last seventeen years,

	Fully convinced that an enlarged membership is desirable in order to take advantage of the current propitious international climate to negotiate and conclude, on the solid basis of a more representative participation, a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty and other important agreements requiring universal adherence,

	Strongly regretting, nevertheless, that the decision of the Conference on Disarmament to adopt the report of the then Special Coordinator for Membership, and the recommended composition attached to it, taken at the end of the 1995 session did not result in the immediate expansion of its membership,

	1.	Recalls the report of 12 August 1993 of the Special Coordinator for Membership 7/ designated by the Conference on Disarmament and the subsequent statement made by the Special Coordinator on 26 August 1993, recommending a dynamic solution to the question of membership;

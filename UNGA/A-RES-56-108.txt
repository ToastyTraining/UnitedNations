Resolution adopted by the General Assembly
[without reference to a Main Committee (A/56/L.56 and Add.1)]
		56/108.	Economic assistance for the reconstruction and development of Djibouti


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 54/96 C of 8 December 1999 and its previous resolutions on economic assistance to Djibouti,
	Recalling also the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1
	Recalling further the Brussels Declaration2 and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010,3 adopted by the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries on 20 May 2001, as well as the mutual commitments undertaken on that occasion and the importance attached to follow-up and the implementation of the Programme of Action,
	Aware that Djibouti is included in the list of least developed countries and that it is ranked 137th out of the 162 countries studied in the Human Development Report 2001,4
	Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti are constrained by the extremes of the local climate, in particular cyclical droughts, and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the capacity of the country,
	Noting also that the situation in Djibouti has been made worse by the drought situation in the Horn of Africa, and noting further the presence of tens of thousands of refugees and persons displaced from their countries, which has placed serious strains on the fragile economic, social and administrative infrastructure of Djibouti and caused security problems in the country, in particular in the city of Djibouti,
	Noting with satisfaction that the Government of Djibouti is continuing to implement a structural adjustment programme, and convinced of the necessity to support that financial recovery programme and to take effective measures to alleviate the consequences, in particular the social consequences, of that adjustment policy, so that the country may achieve lasting economic results,
	Noting with gratitude the support provided to relief, demobilization and rehabilitation operations by various countries and by intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;5
	2.	Declares its solidarity with the Government and the people of Djibouti, who continue to face critical challenges owing, in particular, to the scarcity of natural resources, harsh climatic conditions and the continuing critical situation in the Horn of Africa;
	3.	Notes with concern the cyclical drought phenomenon in Djibouti, which is wreaking a major humanitarian disaster upon tens of thousands of people, particularly those who are vulnerable, and requests the international community to respond to the appeal launched by the Government;
	4.	Encourages the Government of Djibouti, despite difficult economic and regional situations, to continue its serious efforts towards the consolidation of democracy;
	5.	Notes with satisfaction the implementation of a structural adjustment programme by Djibouti, and in that context appeals to all Governments, international financial institutions, the specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations to respond adequately to the financial and material needs of the country;
	6.	Also notes with satisfaction the general peace agreement concluded between the Government and the opposition on 12 May 2001;
	7.	Considers that the process of demobilization, reintegration and employment of demobilized soldiers is essential not only for national rehabilitation but also for the success of agreements with the international financial institutions and for the consolidation of peace, and that it requires substantial resources that exceed the capacity of the country;
	8.	Expresses its gratitude to the intergovernmental organizations and the specialized agencies of the United Nations for their contributions to the national rehabilitation of Djibouti, and invites them to continue their efforts;
	9.	Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for his continued efforts to make the international community aware of the difficulties faced by Djibouti;
	10.	Notes with gratitude Djibouti's support for regional peace efforts and its commitment to worldwide efforts to fight terrorism;
	11.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue, in close cooperation with the Government of Djibouti, his efforts to mobilize resources necessary for an effective programme of financial, technical and material assistance to Djibouti;
	12.	Also requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session on the progress made with regard to economic assistance to Djibouti and the implementation of the present resolution.

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/48/829/Add.1)]


48/257.Financing of the United Nations Military Liaison Team in Cambodia

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Military Liaison Team in Cambodia 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 880 (1993) of
4 November 1993, by which the Council decided to establish the United Nations Military Liaison Team in Cambodia,

	Recalling its decision 48/480 of 23 December 1993 on the financing of the Military Liaison Team,

	Recognizing that the costs of the Military Liaison Team are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recognizing also that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Military Liaison Team, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

_____________

	1/	A/48/800 and Corr.1.

	2/	A/48/919.


	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Military Liaison Team with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Urges all Member States that have not already met their obligations under General Assembly decision 48/480 to make every possible effort to ensure early payment of their assessed contributions to the United Nations Military Liaison Team in Cambodia;

	2.	Reaffirms that, pursuant to its resolution 48/209 of
21 December 1993, the office referred to in paragraph 12 of the report of the Secretary-General 1/ is to be called a field office of the United Nations development system;

	3.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions; 2/

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Military Liaison Team is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

	5.	Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Military Liaison Team promptly and in full;

	6.	Affirms that, among other factors, the failure of Member States to pay their assessed contributions promptly and in full and the fact that the General Assembly has unfortunately been led to consider and approve peace-keeping budgets without adequate documentation have damaged and continue to damage the ability of peace-keeping operations to implement their activities effectively;

	7.	Decides to appropriate to the Special Account referred to in General Assembly decision 48/480 an amount of 910,400 United States dollars gross (872,100 dollars net) for the operation of the Miliary Liaison Team for the six-month period from 15 November 1993 to 15 May 1994, inclusive of the amount of 756,500 dollars gross (724,200 dollars net) authorized and apportioned in accordance with decision 48/480;

	8.	Decides also, as an ad hoc arrangement, to apportion the additional amount of 153,900 dollars gross (147,900 dollars net) for the period from 15 November 1993 to 15 May 1994, taking into account the amount of 756,500 dollars gross (724,200 dollars net) already apportioned in accordance with General Assembly decision 48/480, among Member States in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991 and 47/218 A of 23 December 1992 and its decision 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and taking into account the scale of assessments for the years 1992, 1993 and 1994 as set out in Assembly resolutions 46/221 A of

20 December 1991 and 48/223 A of 23 December 1993 and Assembly decision 47/456 of 23 December 1992;

	9.	Decides further that, in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955, there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 8 above, their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated staff assessment income of 6,000 dollars for the period from 15 November 1993 to
15 May 1994 approved for the Military Liaison Team;

	10.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session a performance report on the budget of the Military Liaison Team for the mandate period ending 15 May 1994;


	11.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its forty-ninth session the item entitled "Financing of the United Nations Military Liaison Team in Cambodia".

55/84.	Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination and the convening of the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance


	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming its objectives, as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, of achieving international cooperation in solving problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language or religion,
	Reaffirming also its firm determination and its commitment to eradicate totally and unconditionally racism in all its forms and racial discrimination and its conviction that racism and racial discrimination constitute a total negation of the purposes and principles of the Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1
	Recalling the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination2 and the Convention against Discrimination in Education adopted by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on 14 December 1960,3
	Noting the efforts of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination since its establishment in 1970 to promote the implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,
	Recalling the outcome of the two World Conferences to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, held at Geneva in 19784 and in 1983,5
	Welcoming the outcome of the World Conference on Human Rights, held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993, and, in particular, the attention given in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action6 to the elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance,
	Stressing the importance and sensitivity of the activities of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,
	Recalling with satisfaction the proclamation, in resolution 48/91 of 20 December 1993, of the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, which began in 1993, and the adoption, in resolution 49/146 of 23 December 1994, of the revised Programme of Action for the Third Decade to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination,
	Noting with grave concern that, despite the efforts of the international community, the principal objectives of the two previous Decades have not been attained and that millions of human beings continue to the present day to be the victims of varied forms of racism and racial discrimination,
	Noting with great concern that, despite the efforts undertaken by the international community at various levels, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related forms of intolerance, ethnic antagonism and acts of violence are showing signs of increase in many parts of the world and that the number of associations established on the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters is increasing, as reflected in the report of the Special Rapporteur,7
	Deeply concerned that, despite continuing efforts, contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination, many forms of discrimination against, inter alia, blacks, Arabs, Muslims and Christians, xenophobia, Negrophobia, anti-Semitism and related intolerance persist or are even growing in magnitude, incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to establish policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national superiority or exclusivity,
	Noting with concern that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance may be aggravated by, inter alia, inequitable distribution of wealth, marginalization and social exclusion,
	Recognizing that the promotion of tolerance and respect for cultural diversity is an important factor, among others, in eliminating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,
	Alarmed that technological developments in the field of communications, including the Internet, continue to be utilized by various groups engaged in violent activity to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world,
	Noting that the use of such technologies can also contribute to combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,
	Having considered the report submitted by the Secretary-General8 within the framework of the implementation of the Programme of Action,
	Recalling its resolution 54/154 of 17 December 1999, in which it requested the Secretary-General to include in his report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session concrete proposals on how to ensure the financial and personnel resources required for the implementation of the Programme of Action,
	Recognizing the importance of strengthening national legislation and institutions for the promotion of racial harmony and for the effective enforcement of such legislation,
	Remaining firmly convinced of the need to take more effective and sustained measures at the national and international levels for the elimination of all forms of racism and racial discrimination,
	Deeply concerned that the phenomenon of racism and racial discrimination against migrant workers continues to increase, despite the efforts made by the international community to improve the protection of the human rights of migrant workers and members of their families,
	Recalling the adoption at its forty-fifth session of the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families,9
	Acknowledging that indigenous people are at times victims of particular forms of racism and racial discrimination,
	Noting with concern the existence of multiple discrimination, in particular against women,
	Stressing the importance of urgently eliminating growing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy and tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes, and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication,

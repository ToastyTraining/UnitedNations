	The General Assembly,
	Recognizing that multilingualism, as a core value of the Organization, contributes to the achievement of the goals of the United Nations, as set out in Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations,
	Recognizing also that the United Nations pursues multilingualism as a means of promoting, protecting and preserving diversity of languages and cultures globally, as well as of improving the efficiency, performance and transparency of the Organization,
	Reaffirming its resolutions 53/199 of 15 December 1998 and 61/185 of 20 December 2006 on the proclamation of international years and Economic and Social Council resolution 1980/67 of 25 July 1980 on international years and anniversaries, particularly paragraphs 1 to 10 of the annex thereto on the agreed criteria for the proclamation of international years, and paragraphs 13 and 14, in which it is stated that an international day or year should not be proclaimed before the basic arrangements for its organization and financing have been made,
	Recalling the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,1 
	Recalling also the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,2 in which it is reflected that sign languages are equal to spoken languages, and that States parties to the Convention undertake to recognize, accept and promote the use of sign languages,

	Recalling that early access to sign language and services in sign language, including quality education available in sign language, is vital to the growth and development of the deaf individual and critical to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals,
	Recognizing the importance of preserving sign languages as part of linguistic and cultural diversity,

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all Member States and organizations of the United Nations system;

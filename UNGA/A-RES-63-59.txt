Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 2 December 2008
[on the report of the First Committee (A/63/389)]
63/59.	Compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and commitments


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 60/55 of 8 December 2005 and other relevant resolutions on the question, and noting the report of the Panel of Government Experts on verification in all its aspects, including the role of the United Nations in the field of verification,1 
	Recognizing the abiding concern of all Member States for ensuring respect for the rights and obligations arising from treaties to which they are parties and from other sources of international law,
	Convinced that observance by Member States of the Charter of the United Nations and compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements to which they are parties and with other agreed obligations are essential for regional and global peace, security and stability,
	Stressing that failure by States parties to comply with such agreements and with other agreed obligations not only adversely affects the security of States parties but also can create security risks for other States relying on the constraints and commitments stipulated in those agreements,
	Stressing also that the viability and effectiveness of non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and of other agreed obligations require that those agreements be fully complied with and enforced,
	Concerned by non-compliance by some States with their respective obligations,
	Noting that verification and compliance, and enforcement in a manner consistent with the Charter, are integrally related,
	Recognizing the importance of and support for effective national, regional, and international capacities for such verification, compliance, and enforcement,
	Recognizing also that full compliance by States with all their respective non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and with other agreed obligations they have undertaken contributes to efforts to prevent the development and proliferation, contrary to international obligations, of weapons of mass destruction, related technologies and means of delivery, as well as to efforts to deny non-State actors access to such capabilities,
	1.	Underscores the contribution that compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and with other agreed obligations makes to enhancing confidence and to strengthening international security and stability;
	2.	Urges all States to implement and to comply fully with their respective obligations;
	3.	Calls upon all Member States to encourage and, for those States in a position to do so, to appropriately assist States which request assistance to increase their capacity to implement fully their obligations;
	4.	Calls upon all concerned States to take concerted action, in a manner consistent with relevant international law, to encourage, through bilateral and multilateral means, the compliance by all States with their respective non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and with other agreed obligations, and to hold those not in compliance with such agreements accountable for their non-compliance in a manner consistent with the Charter of the United Nations;
	5.	Urges those States not currently in compliance with their respective obligations and commitments to make the strategic decision to come back into compliance;
	6.	Encourages efforts by all States, the United Nations and other international organizations, pursuant to their respective mandates, to take action, consistent with the Charter, to prevent serious damage to international security and stability arising from non-compliance by States with their existing non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament obligations.

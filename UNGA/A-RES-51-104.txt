	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Third Committee (A/51/619/Add.2)]


51/104.United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education and public information activities in the field of human rights


	The General Assembly,

	Guided by the fundamental and universal principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 according to article 26 of which "education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms", and the provisions of other international human rights instruments, such as those of article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights2 and article 28 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,3 that reflect the aims of the aforementioned article,

	Recalling the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights concerning the World Public Information Campaign on Human Rights, the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education, 1995-2004, the project of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization entitled "Towards a culture of peace", the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993,4 and the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,


	Believing that the World Public Information Campaign on Human Rights is a valuable complement to the activities of the United Nations aimed at the further promotion and protection of human rights, and recalling the importance attached by the World Conference on Human Rights to human rights education and information,

	Convinced that human rights education should involve more than the provision of information and should constitute a comprehensive lifelong process by which people at all levels of development and in all societies learn respect for the dignity of others and the means and methods of ensuring that respect,

	Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed programmes of teaching, learning, training and sharing of experiences, materials and information can have a catalytic effect on national, regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations,

	Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages that takes into account the diverse segments of society such as children, indigenous people, minorities and disabled persons,

	Taking into account the efforts to promote human rights education made by educators and non-governmental organizations in all parts of the world, as well as by intergovernmental organizations, including the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the International Labour Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund,

	Convinced that each woman, man and child, to realize their full human potential, must be made aware of all their human rights and fundamental freedoms,

	Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education, especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities,

	Aware of the potential supportive role of the private sector in implementing at all levels of society the Plan of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education, 1995-20045 and the World Public Information Campaign, through creative initiatives and financial support for governmental and non-governmental activities,

	Convinced that the effectiveness of existing human rights education and public information activities would be enhanced by better coordination and cooperation at the national, regional and international levels,

	Recalling that it is within the responsibility of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to coordinate relevant United Nations education and public information programmes in the field of human rights,

	1.

	8.	Requests the High Commissioner/Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat to continue to coordinate the implementation of the Plan of Action to ensure maximum effectiveness and efficiency in the use, processing, management and distribution of information and educational materials and to continue to coordinate and harmonize human rights information strategies within the United Nations system;

	9.

	14.	Stresses the need for close collaboration between the High Commissioner/Centre for Human Rights and the Department of Public Information in the implementation of the World Public Information Campaign on Human Rights and the Plan of Action and the need to harmonize their activities with those of other organizations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in the project entitled "Towards a culture of peace" and the International Committee of the Red Cross and relevant non-governmental organizations with regard to the dissemination of information on international humanitarian law;

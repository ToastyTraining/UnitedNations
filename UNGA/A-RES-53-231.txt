	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/53/980)]


	53/231.  Financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus


    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus1 and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

    Recalling Security Council resolution 186 (1964) of 4 March 1964, by which the Council established the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force, the latest of which was resolution 1217 (1998) of 22 December 1998,

    Recalling also its resolution 52/241 of 26 June 1998 on the financing of the Force,

    Reaffirming that the costs of the Force that are not covered by voluntary contributions are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,


    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force by certain Governments,

    Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Expressing its appreciation to all those Member States and observer States which have made voluntary contributions to the Special Account established for the financing of the Force during the period prior to 16 June 1993,

    Noting that voluntary contributions were insufficient to cover all the costs of the Force, including those incurred by troop-contributing Governments prior to 16 June 1993, and regretting the absence of an adequate response to appeals for voluntary contributions, including that contained in the letter dated 17 May 1994 from the Secretary-General to all Member States,3

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

    1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus as at 30 April 1999, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 17.7 million United States dollars, representing 12.7 per cent of the total assessed contributions from 16 June 1993 to the period ending 30 June 1999, notes that some 16 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

    2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

    3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;


    4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Force in full and on time;

    5.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;4

    6.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Force is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

    7.	Also requests the Secretary-General, in order to reduce the cost of employing General Service staff, to continue efforts to recruit local staff for the Force against General Service posts, commensurate with the requirements of the Force;

    8.	Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus an amount of 45,630,927 dollars gross (43,892,427 dollars net) for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, inclusive of an amount of 2,270,759 dollars for the support account for peacekeeping operations, and the amount of 445,268 dollars for the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy;

    9.	Decides also, as an ad hoc arrangement, taking into consideration the funding through voluntary contributions of one third of the cost of the Force, equivalent to 14,630,810 dollars, by the Government of Cyprus and the annual pledge of 6.5 million dollars from the Government of Greece, to apportion among Member States the amount of 24,500,117 dollars gross (22,761,617 dollars net), for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, at a monthly rate of 2,041,676 dollars gross (1,896,801 dollars net) in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996, 51/218 A to C of 18 December 1996 and 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and  50/451 B of 23  December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the years 1999 and 2000 as set out in its resolution 52/215 A of 22 December 1997, subject to the decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the Force beyond 30 June 1999;

    10.	Decides further that, in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955, there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 9 above, their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated staff assessment income of 1,738,500 dollars approved for the Force for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000;

    11.	Decides that, for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force, there shall be set off against the apportionment as provided for in paragraph 9 above, their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 178,500 dollars gross (6,300 dollars net) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1998;


    12.	Decides also that, for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force, their share of the unencumbered balance of 178,500 dollars gross (6,300 dollars net) in respect of  the period ending 30 June 1998 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations;

    13.	Decides further to continue to maintain as separate the account established for the period prior to 16 June 1993 for the Force, invites Member States to make voluntary contributions to that account, and requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts in appealing for voluntary contributions to the account;

    14.	Invites voluntary contributions to the Force in cash and in the form of services and supplies acceptable to the Secretary-General, to be administered, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedure and practices established by the General Assembly;

    15.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-fourth session the item entitled "Financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus".

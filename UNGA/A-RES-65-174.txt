	Expressing concern that, after the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006) and five years from the 2015 target date of the Millennium Development Goals, while there has been progress in reducing poverty in some regions, this progress has been uneven and the number of people living in poverty in some countries continues to increase, with women and children constituting the majority of the most affected groups, especially in the least developed countries and, in particular, in sub-Saharan Africa,

	Underlining the priority and urgency given by Heads of State and Government to the eradication of poverty, as expressed in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic and social fields,
	1.	Reaffirms that the objective of the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2008-2017) is to support, in an efficient and coordinated manner, the follow-up to the implementation of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, relating to the eradication of poverty and to coordinate international support to that end;
	2.	Also reaffirms that each country must take primary responsibility for its own development and that the role of national policies and strategies cannot be overemphasized for the achievement of sustainable development and poverty eradication, and recognizes that increased effective national efforts should be complemented by concrete, effective and supportive international programmes, measures and policies aimed at expanding the development opportunities of developing countries, while taking into account national conditions and ensuring respect for national ownership, strategies and sovereignty;

	9.	Emphasizes that education and training are among the critical factors in empowering those living in poverty, while recognizing the complexity of the challenge of poverty eradication, and in this regard recognizes the role of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in coordinating the Education for All partners and in promoting the development of sector-wide education policies by, inter alia, elaborating pedagogical tools for grass-roots organizations and policymakers;

	12.

	21.	Notes with concern the continuing high levels of unemployment as a consequence of the global financial and economic crisis, recognizes that decent work remains one of the best routes out of poverty, and in this regard invites donor countries, multilateral organizations and other development partners to continue to assist Member States, in particular developing countries, in adopting policies consistent with the Global Jobs Pact adopted by the International Labour Conference at its ninety-eighth session, as a general framework within which each country can formulate policy packages specific to its situation and national priorities in order to promote a job-intensive recovery and sustainable development;

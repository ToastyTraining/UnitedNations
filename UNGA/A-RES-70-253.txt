Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 12 February 2016
[without reference to a Main Committee (A/70/L.31/Rev.1)]
70/253.	Graduation of Angola from the least developed country category


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling Economic and Social Council resolution 2015/11 of 10 June 2015 on the report of the Committee for Development Policy on its seventeenth session,
	Taking into account its resolutions 59/209 of 20 December 2004, 65/286 of 29 June 2011 and 67/221 of 21 December 2012 on a smooth transition for countries graduating from the list of least developed countries, 
	Recalling paragraph 10 of its resolution 67/221, in which it decided to take note of the decisions of the Economic and Social Council regarding the graduation of countries from the least developed country category, as well as the inclusion of countries in that category, at the first session of the General Assembly following the adoption of the decisions,
	Giving due consideration to the fact that Angola, as a commodity-dependent developing country, continues to be highly vulnerable to price fluctuations, and to the importance for Angola of economic diversification and the reduction of social vulnerabilities, 
	Emphasizing that graduation from the least developed country category is a major milestone for the country involved as it means that significant progress has been made towards reaching at least some of its development goals,
	1.	Reaffirms that graduating from the category of least developed countries should not result in a disruption of development plans, programmes and projects;
	2.	Takes note of the endorsement by the Economic and Social Council of the recommendation of the Committee for Development Policy that Angola be graduated from the least developed country category, and decides to provide Angola, on an exceptional basis, with an additional preparatory period of two years before the start of the three-year preparatory period leading to graduation;
	3.	Invites Angola to prepare, during the five-year period between the adoption of the present resolution and its graduation from the least developed country category, its national smooth-transition strategy, with the support of the United Nations system and in cooperation with its bilateral, regional and multilateral development and trading partners.

52/203.Operational activities for development of the United Nations


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolutions 44/211 of 22 December 1989, 47/199 of 22 December 1992, 50/120 of 20 December 1995 and 50/227 of 24 May 1996, as well as Economic and Social Council resolution 1997/59 of 24 July 1997 and other relevant resolutions,

	Reaffirming that operational activities for development within the United Nations system have a critical and unique role to play in enabling developing countries to continue to take a lead in the management of their own development process and that the funds and programmes constitute important vehicles for advancing international development cooperation,

	Recalling that the General Assembly is the highest intergovernmental mechanism for the formulation and appraisal of policy matters relating to the economic, social and related fields, in accordance with Chapter IX of the Charter of the United Nations, and that the functions and powers of the Economic and Social Council are provided for in Chapters IX and X of the Charter and are elaborated in relevant Assembly resolutions, including resolutions 45/264 of 13 May 1991 and 48/162 of 20 December 1993, in which the Assembly defined the relationship between the Assembly, the Council and the executive boards of the funds and programmes, in particular the Council function of overall guidance and coordination of the operational activities for development of the United Nations system,

	Stressing that the fundamental characteristics of the operational activities of the United Nations system should be, inter alia, their universal, voluntary and grant nature, their neutrality and their multilateralism, as well as their ability to respond to the needs of developing countries in a flexible manner, and that the operational activities of the United Nations system are carried out for the benefit of the developing countries, at the request of those countries and in accordance with their own policies and priorities for development,

	Recognizing the need to take into account the individual mandates and complementarities of the organizations and bodies of the United Nations development system, and the priorities agreed upon in the executive boards of the funds and programmes,

	Expressing serious concern at the persistent insufficiency of resources for operational activities for development of the United Nations system, in particular the decline in contributions to core resources,

	Recognizing the need for priority allocation for scarce grant resources to programmes and projects in low-income countries, in particular the least developed countries,

	Recognizing also that the United Nations development system should take into account the specific needs and requirements of the countries with economies in transition,

	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on funding modalities of operational activities,1
 as requested by the Economic and Social Council;

	2.	Strongly reaffirms the need for a substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable, continuous and assured basis, commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries;

	3.	Stresses the need for a continuous overall improvement in the effectiveness, efficiency and impact of the United Nations system in delivering its development assistance, and welcomes steps that have been taken towards that end;

	4.	Also stresses that other countries that are in a position to do so should strive to augment their assistance in the framework of development cooperation;

	5.	Recalls that the executive boards of the United Nations funds and programmes, in accordance with resolution 50/227, should initiate work on reviewing their funding policies and strategies with a view to meeting their agreed targets, particularly of core resources as the main source of funding of operational activities;

	6.	Calls upon the governing bodies of the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Children's Fund, the United Nations Population Fund and the World Food Programme to adopt a specific and achievable target for core resources for the period 1999-2001, taking into account the relationship between their programme arrangements and financial plans;

	7.	Urges the executive boards to complete the review as soon as possible and to report thereon to the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 1998;

	8.	Acknowledges the supplementary role of non-core resources in enhancing the financing of the United Nations operational activities for development;

	9.	Requests the Secretary-General, when presenting his comprehensive report on the triennial policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system at the fifty-third session of the General Assembly, to consider the implications of steps adopted by the United Nations system to implement reform initiatives on operational activities, and to make recommendations for their effective and expeditious implementation, bearing in mind the views of Member States;

	10.	Also requests the funds and programmes, in their regular reporting on the triennial policy review to the General Assembly through the Economic and Social Council, to include in their reports, to the extent possible and in a clearly identifiable way, actions taken to implement adopted reform measures of the Secretary-General, including an analysis of the implications of those reforms for operational activities as well as for inter-agency coordination;


	11.	Welcomes the ongoing efforts of the Secretariat to seek information from Member States on all issues to be considered by the triennial policy review, invites Member States to actively participate in that important data-collection exercise, including through timely completion of the relevant questionnaire, and to the extent needed requests the resident coordinators to facilitate its successful implementation;

	12.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session, through the Economic and Social Council, a comprehensive analysis of the implementation of its resolution 50/120, as well as subsequent relevant decisions and resolutions of the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council, in the context of the triennial policy review, and to make appropriate recommendations.

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly

[on the report of the Third Committee (A/55/602/Add.2 and Corr.1)]
55/110.  Human rights and unilateral coercive measures


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 51/103 of 12 December 1996, 52/120 of 12 December 1997, 53/141 of 9 December 1998 and 54/172 of 17 December 1999, as well as Commission on Human Rights resolution 1998/11 of 9 April 1998,1 and taking note of Commission resolution 2000/11 of 17 April 2000,2
	Reaffirming the pertinent principles and provisions contained in the Charter of Economic Rights and Duties of States proclaimed by the General Assembly in its resolution 3281 (XXIX) of 12 December 1974, in particular article 32 thereof, in which it declared that no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights,
	Taking note of the report submitted by the Secretary-General,3 pursuant to Commission on Human Rights resolution 1999/21 of 23 April 1999,4 and the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of resolution 52/120,5
	Recognizing the universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated character of all human rights, and, in this regard, reaffirming the right to development as an integral part of all human rights,
	Recalling that the World Conference on Human Rights, held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993, called upon States to refrain from any unilateral coercive measure not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations that creates obstacles to trade relations among States and impedes the full realization of all human rights,6
	Bearing in mind all the references to this question in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development, adopted by the  World Summit for Social Development on 12 March 1995,7 the Beijing Declaration and the Platform for Action, adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women on 15 September 1995,8 and the Istanbul Declaration on Human Settlements and the Habitat Agenda, adopted by the second United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II) on 14 June 1996,9
	Expressing its concern about the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures in the field of international relations, trade, investment and cooperation,
	Deeply concerned that, despite the recommendations adopted on this question by the General Assembly and recent major United Nations conferences and contrary to general international law and the Charter of the United Nations, unilateral coercive measures continue to be promulgated and implemented with all their negative implications for the social-humanitarian activities and economic and social development of developing countries, including their extraterritorial effects, thereby creating additional obstacles to the full enjoyment of all human rights by peoples and individuals under the jurisdiction of other States,
	Bearing in mind all the extraterritorial effects of any unilateral legislative, administrative and economic measures, policies and practices of a coercive nature against the development process and the enhancement of human rights in developing countries, which create obstacles to the full realization of all human rights,
	Noting the continuing efforts of the Open-ended Working Group on the Right to Development of the Commission on Human Rights, and reaffirming in particular its criteria according to which unilateral coercive measures are one of the obstacles to the implementation of the Declaration on the Right to Development,10
	1.	Urges all States to refrain from adopting or implementing any unilateral measures not in accordance with international law and the Charter of the United Nations, in particular those of a coercive nature with all their extraterritorial effects, which create obstacles to trade relations among States, thus impeding the full realization of the rights set forth in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights11 and other international human rights instruments, in particular the right of individuals and peoples to development;
	2.	Invites all States to consider adopting administrative or legislative measures, as appropriate, to counteract the extraterritorial application or effects of unilateral coercive measures;
	3.	Rejects unilateral coercive measures with all their extraterritorial effects as tools for political or economic pressure against any country, in particular against developing countries, because of their negative effects on the realization of all the human rights of vast sectors of their populations, in particular children, women and the elderly;
	4.	Calls upon Member States that have initiated such measures to commit themselves to their obligations and responsibilities arising from the international human rights instruments to which they are party by revoking such measures at the earliest time possible;
	5.	Reaffirms, in this context, the right of all peoples to self-determination, by virtue of which they freely determine their political status and freely pursue their economic, social and cultural development;
	6.	Urges the Commission on Human Rights to take fully into account the negative impact of unilateral coercive measures, including the enactment of national laws and their extraterritorial application, in its task concerning the implementation of the right to development;
	7.	Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, in discharging her functions relating to the promotion, realization and protection of the right to development and bearing in mind the continuing impact of unilateral coercive measures on the population of developing countries, to give priority to the present resolution in her annual report to the General Assembly;
	8.	Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all Member States, to continue to collect their views and information on the implications and negative effects of unilateral coercive measures on their populations and to submit an analytical report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session, highlighting the practical and preventive measures in this respect;
	9.	Decides to examine this question on a priority basis at its fifty-sixth session under the sub-item entitled "Human rights questions, including alternative approaches for improving the effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms".

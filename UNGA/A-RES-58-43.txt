58/43.	Confidence-building measures in the regional and subregional context


	The General Assembly,
	Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations,
	Recalling its resolution 57/337 of 3 July 2003 entitled "Prevention of armed conflict", in which it calls upon Member States to settle their disputes by peaceful means, as set out in Chapter VI of the Charter, inter alia, by any procedures adopted by the parties, including the most effective use of the International Court of Justice,
	Recalling also the Security Council resolutions relating to the prevention of armed conflict, and noting all Security Council presidential statements relating to this matter,
	Considering the importance and effectiveness of confidence-building measures taken at the initiative and with the participation of all States concerned and taking into account the specific characteristics of each region, since such measures can contribute to regional stability,
	Convinced that resources released by disarmament, including regional disarmament, can be devoted to economic and social development and to the protection of the environment for the benefit of all peoples, in particular those of the developing countries,
	Recognizing the need for meaningful dialogue among States concerned in the regions of tension to avert conflict,
	Welcoming the peace processes already initiated by States concerned to resolve their disputes through peaceful means bilaterally or through mediation, inter alia, by third parties, regional organizations or the United Nations,
	Recognizing that States in some regions have already taken steps towards confidence-building measures at the bilateral, subregional and regional levels in the political and military fields, including arms control and disarmament, and noting that such confidence-building measures have improved peace and security in those regions and contributed to progress in the socio-economic conditions of their people,
	Concerned that the continuation of disputes among States, particularly in the absence of an effective mechanism to resolve them through peaceful means, may contribute to the arms race and endanger the maintenance of international peace and security and the efforts of the international community to promote arms control and disarmament,
	1.	Calls upon Member States to refrain from the use or threat of use of force in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations;
	2.

	3.	Calls upon Member States that have not already done so to open consultations and dialogue in the regions of tension without preconditions;
	4.	Urges States to comply strictly with all bilateral, regional and international agreements, including arms control and disarmament agreements, to which they are party;
	5.	Urges also, in the context of confidence-building measures, the maintenance of military balance between States in the regions of tension consistent with the principle of undiminished security at the lowest level of armaments;
	6.	Encourages the promotion of unilateral, bilateral and regional confidence-building measures to avoid conflict and prevent the unintended and accidental outbreak of hostilities;
	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States with a view to exploring possibilities of furthering efforts towards confidence-building measures in the regional and subregional context, particularly in the regions of tension;
	8.	Also requests the Secretary-General to report on the subject to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session;
	9.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-ninth session an item entitled "Confidence-building measures in the regional and subregional context".

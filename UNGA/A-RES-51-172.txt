	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General,1 as well as the report prepared by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on the sixth Inter-Agency Round Table on Communication for Development, held at Harare from 2 to 5 September 1996, and the report of the Joint Inspection Unit entitled "Communication for development programmes in the United Nations system"2 and the comments of the Administrative Committee on Coordination thereon,3 

	1.	Recalls its resolution 50/130 of 20 December 1995;

	2.	Considers that informal round tables, such as the sixth Inter-Agency Round Table on Communication for Development, organized at Harare by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, can constitute a notable mechanism of inter-agency cooperation and coordination for promoting and advancing communication for development, owing, inter alia, to their openness to partners outside the United Nations system and the outreach of their outcomes;

	4.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General,1 and invites the agencies, organizations, funds and programmes of the United Nations system to take the recommendations contained in the report into consideration when planning and implementing relevant projects and programmes, with the cooperation of the resident coordinator;

	5.	Recognizes the relevance for concerned actors in development at the country level, including policy makers and decision makers at all levels, to attribute increased importance to communication for development, and encourages them to include it, in an appropriate manner, as an integral component in the development of projects and programmes;

	6.	Stresses the need to support two-way communication systems that enable dialogue and that allow communities to speak out, express their aspirations and concerns and participate in the decisions that relate to their development;

	7.	Acknowledges the interest in holding the next informal round table in the Latin American and Caribbean region, to build upon the meetings held in Asia and Africa, and invites interested States to cooperate with the relevant agencies, organizations, funds and programmes of the United Nations system in the convening of these informal round tables on communication for development, with the participation of the international financial institutions and the regional banks, at the country level;

	8.	Reaffirms the importance of resource mobilization, including financial cooperation, the transfer of technology and capacity-building for communication in development programmes and projects, and calls upon the international community and organizations of the United Nations system to assist developing countries in introducing technologies and innovative methods for enhancing communication for development;

	9.	Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, in accordance with the agency's mandate, to inform the General Assembly officially, at its fifty-third session, under an appropriate agenda item, on the implementation of the present resolution, in accordance with the periodicity that was agreed upon in Assembly resolution 50/130.

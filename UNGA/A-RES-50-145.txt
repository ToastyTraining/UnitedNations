	Recalling its resolution 49/157 of 23 December 1994, in which it requested the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice to give priority attention at its fourth session to the conclusions and recommendations of the Ninth Congress, with a view to recommending, through the Economic and Social Council, appropriate follow-up by the General Assembly at its fiftieth session,

	3.

	8.	Also encourages the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat to include the traffic in women and girls in its programme of work under its advisory, training and information services, with a view to providing assistance to member Governments, upon their request, in instituting preventive measures against trafficking through education and appropriate information campaigns;

	9.	Requests the Commission on Human Rights to encourage the Working Group on Contemporary Forms of Slavery of the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities to continue to address the issue of the traffic in women and girls under its draft programme of action on the traffic in persons and the exploitation of the prostitution of others; 16/

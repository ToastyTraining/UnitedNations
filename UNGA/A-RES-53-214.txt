	IV

	FIRST PERFORMANCE REPORT

        Having considered the first performance report of the Secretary-General on the programme budget for the biennium 1998-19994 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,5

    1.	Reaffirms the budgetary process as approved in its resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986 and as reaffirmed in subsequent resolutions;

    2.	Reaffirms also its resolution 52/220 of 22 December 1997;
 
    3.	Takes note of the first performance report of the Secretary-General on the programme budget for the biennium 1998-19994 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;5

    4.	Reaffirms the requirement of all Member States to fulfil their financial obligations as set out in the Charter of the United Nations promptly and in full and without imposing conditions;

    5.	Recognizes the detrimental effect of the withholding of assessed contributions on the administrative and financial functioning of the United Nations;

    6.	Approves a net decrease of 48,200,900 dollars in the appropriations approved for the biennium 1998-1999 and a net decrease of 4,552,500 dollars in the estimates of income for the biennium 1998-1999, to be apportioned among expenditure and income sections as indicated in the report of the Secretary-General;

    7.	Expresses concern about the fact that a number of sections of the programme budget continue to reflect high levels of vacancy, which could have an impact on the full implementation of the programmes and activities mandated by the General Assembly;

    8.	Reiterates that the vacancy rate is a tool for budgetary calculations and should not be used to achieve budgetary savings;
    

    9.	Also reiterates that a high vacancy rate hampers the delivery of mandated programmes and activities, and stresses that deliberate management decisions to keep a certain number of posts vacant makes the budget process less transparent and the management of staff resources more difficult;

    10.	Reaffirms that only the General Assembly has the authority to establish and abolish posts in the regular budget;

    11.	Requests the Secretary-General immediately to intensify recruitment efforts in order to reduce the number of vacancies, particularly in those areas where there are high vacancy rates;

    12.	Decides that the vacancy rate for posts in the Professional and higher categories should not be more than 5 per cent at the end of the biennium 1998-1999, and in this context requests the Secretary-General to take all the necessary steps to achieve this objective;

    13.	Requests the Secretary-General to enhance the Office of the President of the General Assembly by taking all the necessary steps to ensure the full implementation of paragraph 1B.10 of the report of the Secretary-General entitled "United Nations reform: measures and proposals",6 as adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 52/220, so as to provide transparency and accountability and thereby strengthen the ability of the President of the General Assembly effectively and efficiently to discharge the responsibilities of the Office as deemed appropriate;

    14.	Decides that the President of the General Assembly, consistent with the approved programme budget, should have full authority to use the funds provided in the budget for the Office, including hospitality and travel and any other requirements for the accomplishment of the official responsibilities;

    15.	Notes that paragraphs 74 to 80 of its resolution 52/220 defined the procedures to be followed in the proposed programme budget in dealing with activities related to country-specific special rapporteurs whose mandates had expired in 1997 and, as a consequence, there were no individual mandates for inclusion in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999;

    16.	Reaffirms that, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 79 of its resolution 52/220, no funds directly related to these non-mandated activities could be committed to them pending the consideration of the report on the relationship between the treatment of perennial activities and the use of the contingency fund, as requested in paragraph 78 of its resolution 52/220;

    17.	Regrets that the provisions of the decision contained in paragraph 79 of resolution 52/220 were not implemented, since the required report was not considered before 1998 activities related to country-specific special rapporteurs were implemented;

    18.	Requests the Secretary-General to improve the presentation of the budget performance reports by separately reflecting the impact of average vacancy rates on changes related to salaries and common staff costs for each budget section;

    19.	Also requests the Secretary-General to provide an explanation when average vacancy rates are higher than the level approved by the General Assembly;

    20.	Reiterates the need for the Secretary-General to ensure that resources are utilized strictly for the purposes approved by the General Assembly;


    21.	Regrets the tendency towards excessive use of consultants, in particular in areas where in-house expertise is available, and requests the Secretary-General to resort in future to the use of consultants only when in-house expertise is not available and in accordance with the existing rules and regulations and relevant resolutions;

    22.	Reaffirms that changes in mandated programmes and activities are the prerogative of the General Assembly;

	V

	CONSOLIDATION OF TECHNICAL SECRETARIAT SERVICING
	OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL BODIES

    Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General,7 and decides to revert to this question as appropriate in the context of the reform process;

	VI

	CONSTRUCTION OF ADDITIONAL CONFERENCE FACILITIES AT ADDIS ABABA
	AND BANGKOK

    Takes note of the reports of the Secretary-General on the construction of conference facilities at Addis Ababa and Bangkok,8 and endorses the recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions contained in paragraph 5 of its report;9


	VII

	INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM

    
    Reaffirming its resolutions 43/217 of 21 December 1988 and 52/227 of 31 March 1998,

    6.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all the necessary actions to ensure that the activities are performed with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

    7.	Decides to approve an additional appropriation of 3.3 million dollars;

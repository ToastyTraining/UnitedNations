	Reaffirming also that any economic or other activity that constitutes an obstacle to the implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples and obstructs efforts aimed at the elimination of colonialism is a direct violation of the rights of the inhabitants and of the principles of the Charter and all relevant resolutions of the United Nations,

	Reaffirming further that the natural resources are the heritage of the indigenous populations of the colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories,

	Bearing in mind the relevant provisions of the final documents of the successive Conferences of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries and of the resolutions adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity, the South Pacific Forum and the Caribbean Community,

	2.

	6.	Reiterates that the exploitation and plundering of the marine and other natural resources of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories by foreign economic interests, in violation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations, is a threat to the integrity and prosperity of those Territories;

	7.	Invites all Governments and organizations of the United Nations system to take all possible measures to ensure that the permanent sovereignty of the peoples of colonial and Non-Self-Governing Territories over their natural resources is fully respected and safeguarded;

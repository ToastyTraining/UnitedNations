	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/48/814/Add.1)]


	48/241.  Financing of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 626 (1988) of
20 December 1988, by which the Council established the United Nations Angola Verification Mission, Council resolution 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991, by which the Council decided to entrust a new mandate to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (thenceforth called the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II), and Council resolution 747 (1992) of 24 March 1992, by which the Council decided to enlarge the mandate of the Verification Mission to include an Electoral Division for the purpose of observing and verifying the electoral process in Angola,

	Bearing in mind also Security Council resolution 804 (1993) of 29 January 1993, by which the Council approved the recommendation of the Secretary-General to maintain a Special Representative for Angola based at Luanda, with the necessary civilian, military and police staff, and subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Verification Mission, the latest of which was resolution 903 (1994) of 16 March 1994,

	Recalling its resolution 46/195 B of 31 July 1992 and its decisions 47/450 B of 8 April 1993, 47/450 C of 14 September 1993 and 48/465 of
23 December 1993 on the financing of the Verification Mission,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Verification Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

_____________

	1/	A/48/836 and Corr.1 and 2.

	2/	A/48/902.
	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Verification Mission, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Verification Mission by certain Governments,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Verification Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

		Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II as at 24 March 1994, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 26,474,847 United States dollars;

		Expresses concern about the deteriorating financial situation with regard to peace-keeping activities due to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments, particularly Member States in arrears;

		Reaffirms its resolution 48/227 of 23 December 1993 and stresses the need for the Secretariat to submit budget documents in time in order to allow for a proper and thorough review and approval by the General Assembly of the budgets before their implementation;

		Notes with satisfaction an improvement in the compliance by the Secretariat with certain resolutions of the General Assembly with regard to the form of budget documents concerning peace-keeping operations;

		Reaffirms the importance of the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions as an advisory body to the General Assembly in the budget process;

		Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee, 2/ subject to the provisions of the present resolution;

		Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Verification Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy and, in particular, to implement fully the economy, financial and efficiency measures to be approved during the resumed forty-eighth session but no later than 1 May 1994, and to report on the implementation of such measures in the context of the performance report relevant to the period;

		Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Verification Mission promptly and in full;

		Affirms:

	(a)	That, among other factors, the failure by Member States to pay assessed contributions promptly and in full and the fact that the General Assembly has unfortunately been led to consider and approve peace-keeping budgets without adequate documentation have damaged and continue to damage the ability of peace-keeping operations to implement their activities effectively;

	(b)	That it expects that it will not be asked to take any future decisions on budgets for peace-keeping operations retroactively;

16 December 1993 to 16 March 1994;

		Decides, as an ad hoc arrangement, to apportion the amount of 5,246,750 dollars gross (4,992,375 dollars net) among Member States for the maintenance of the Verification Mission, for the period from 17 March to 31 May 1994, in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991 and 47/218 A of
23 December 1992 and its decision 48/472 A of 23 December 1993, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the years 1992, 1993 and 1994 as set out in Assembly resolutions 46/221 A of 20 December 1991 and 48/223 A of

23 December 1993 and Assembly decision 47/456 of 23 December 1992;

		Decides also that, in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955, there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 13 above, their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated additional staff assessment income of 254,375 dollars approved for the Verification Mission for the period from 17 March to 31 May 1994;

1 June 1994, subject to the Security Council deciding to extend the mandate of the Verification Mission beyond 31 May 1994, the amount of 8,394,800 dollars gross (7,988,000 dollars net) to be apportioned among Member States in accordance with the scheme set out in the present resolution;

		Decides that there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 16 above, their respective share in the interest and miscellaneous income of 1,082,500 dollars for the period ending 15 September 1993;

	Reaffirming that the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action1 and the further initiatives for social development adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session,2 as well as a continued global dialogue on social development issues, constitute the basic framework for the promotion of social development for all at the national and international levels,
	Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration3 and the development goals contained therein, as well as the commitments made at major United Nations summits, conferences and special sessions, including the commitments made at the 2005 World Summit4 and at the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals,5
	Recalling also its resolution 57/270 B of 23 June 2003 on the integrated and coordinated implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic and social fields,

	Reaffirming Economic and Social Council resolution 2008/18 of 24 July 2008 on promoting full employment and decent work for all and Council resolution 2010/12 of 22 July 2010 on promoting social integration, and welcoming the decision of the Commission for Social Development to have "Poverty eradication" as the priority theme for the 2011-2012 review and policy cycle,
	Noting with appreciation the ministerial declaration adopted at the high-level segment of the substantive session of 2006 of the Economic and Social Council, entitled "Creating an environment at the national and international levels conducive to generating full and productive employment and decent work for all, and its impact on sustainable development",6 
	Noting that the decent work agenda of the International Labour Organization, with its four strategic objectives, has an important role to play in achieving the objective of full and productive employment and decent work for all, including its objective of social protection, as reaffirmed in the International Labour Organization Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization,7 in which the particular role of the Organization in promoting fair globalization and its responsibility to assist its members in their efforts were acknowledged, as well as in the Global Jobs Pact,
	Emphasizing the need to enhance the role of the Commission for Social Development in the follow-up to and review of the World Summit for Social Development and the outcome of the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly,
	Recognizing that the three core themes of social development, namely, poverty eradication, full and productive employment and decent work for all and social integration are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, and that an enabling environment therefore needs to be created so that all three objectives can be pursued simultaneously,
	Recognizing also that a people-centred approach must be at the centre of economic and social development,
	Expressing deep concern that attainment of the social development objectives is being hindered by the ongoing adverse impact of the world financial and economic crisis, volatile energy and food prices and the challenges posed by climate change,
	Recognizing the complex character of the current global food crisis and ongoing food insecurity, including food price volatility, as a combination of several major factors, both structural and conjunctural, which is also negatively affected by, inter alia, environmental degradation, drought and desertification, global climate change, natural disasters and the lack of the necessary technology, and recognizing also that a strong commitment from national Governments and the international community as a whole is required to confront the major threats to food security and to ensure that policies in the area of agriculture do not distort trade and worsen the food crisis,
	Deeply concerned that extreme poverty persists in all countries of the world, regardless of their economic, social and cultural situation, and that its extent and its manifestations, such as hunger, trafficking in human beings, disease, lack of adequate shelter and illiteracy, are particularly severe in developing countries, while acknowledging the significant progress made in several parts of the world in combating extreme poverty,
	Recognizing the importance of the international community in supporting national capacity-building efforts in the area of social development, while recognizing the primary responsibility of national Governments in this regard,
	Affirming its strong support for fair globalization and the need to translate growth into eradication of poverty and commitment to strategies and policies that aim to promote full, freely chosen and productive employment and decent work for all and that these should constitute a fundamental component of relevant national and international policies as well as national development strategies, including poverty reduction strategies, and reaffirming that employment creation and decent work should be incorporated into macroeconomic policies, taking fully into account the impact and social dimension of globalization, the benefits and costs of which are often unevenly shared and distributed,
	Recognizing the need to enhance access to the benefits of trade, including agricultural trade, for developing countries in order to foster social development,
	Recognizing also that social inclusion is a means for achieving social integration and is crucial for fostering stable, safe, harmonious, peaceful and just societies and for improving social cohesion so as to create an environment for development and progress,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;8
	2.	Welcomes the reaffirmation by Governments of their will and commitment to continue implementing the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action,1 in particular to eradicate poverty, promote full and productive employment and foster social integration to achieve stable, safe and just societies for all;
	3.	Recognizes that the implementation of the Copenhagen commitments and the attainment of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, are mutually reinforcing and that the Copenhagen commitments are crucial to a coherent people-centred approach to development;
	4.	Reaffirms that the Commission for Social Development continues to have the primary responsibility for the follow-up to and review of the World Summit for Social Development and the outcome of the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly and that it serves as the main United Nations forum for an intensified global dialogue on social development issues, and calls upon Member States, the relevant specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system and civil society to enhance their support for its work;
	5.	Expresses deep concern that the ongoing adverse impact of the world financial and economic crisis, volatile energy and food prices and food insecurity and the challenges posed by climate change, as well as the lack of results so far in the multilateral trade negotiations, have negative implications for social development;
	6.	Stresses the importance of the policy space of national Governments, in particular in the areas of social expenditure and social protection programmes, and calls upon international financial institutions and donors to support developing countries in achieving their social development, in line with their national priorities and strategies by, among other things, providing debt relief;
	7.	Recognizes that the broad concept of social development affirmed by the World Summit for Social Development and the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly has not been fully implemented in national and international policymaking and, although poverty eradication is a central part of development policy and discourse, further attention should be given to the other commitments agreed to at the Summit, in particular those concerning employment and social integration, which have also suffered from a general disconnect between economic and social policymaking;
	8.	Acknowledges that the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006), launched after the World Summit for Social Development, has provided the long-term vision for sustained and concerted efforts at the national and international levels to eradicate poverty;
	9.	Recognizes that the implementation of the commitments made by Governments during the first Decade has fallen short of expectations, and welcomes the proclamation of the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2008-2017) by the General Assembly in its resolution 62/205 of 19 December 2007 in order to support, in an efficient and coordinated manner, the internationally agreed development goals related to poverty eradication, including the Millennium Development Goals;
	10.	Emphasizes that the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Summit, the 2005 World Summit, the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals and the International Conference on Financing for Development, in its Monterrey Consensus,9 have reinforced the priority and urgency of poverty eradication within the United Nations development agenda;
	11.	Also emphasizes that poverty eradication policies should attack poverty by addressing its root and structural causes and manifestations, and that equity and the reduction of inequalities need to be incorporated in those policies;
	12.	Reaffirms that each country has the primary responsibility for its own economic and social development and that the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized, and underlines the importance of adopting effective measures, including new financial mechanisms, as appropriate, to support the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth, sustainable development, poverty eradication and the strengthening of their democratic systems;
	13.	Stresses that an enabling environment is a critical precondition for achieving equity and social development and that, while economic growth is essential, entrenched inequality and marginalization are an obstacle to the broad-based and sustained growth required for sustainable, inclusive and people-centred development, and recognizes the need to balance and ensure complementarity between measures to achieve growth and measures to achieve economic and social equity in order for there to be an impact on overall poverty levels;
	14.	Also stresses that stability in global financial systems and corporate social responsibility and accountability, as well as national economic policies that have an impact on other stakeholders, are essential in creating an enabling international environment to promote economic growth and social development;

	16.	Reaffirms the commitment to gender equality and the empowerment of women, as well as to the mainstreaming of a gender perspective into all development efforts, recognizing that these are critical for achieving sustainable development and for efforts to combat hunger, poverty and disease and to strengthen policies and programmes that improve, ensure and broaden the full participation of women in all spheres of political, economic, social and cultural life, as equal partners, and to improve their access to all resources needed for the full exercise of all their human rights and fundamental freedoms by removing persistent barriers, including ensuring equal access to full and productive employment and decent work, as well as strengthening their economic independence;

	18.	Reaffirms the commitment to promote opportunities for full, freely chosen and productive employment, including for the most disadvantaged, as well as decent work for all, in order to deliver social justice combined with economic efficiency, with full respect for fundamental principles and rights at work under conditions of equity, equality, security and dignity, and further reaffirms that macroeconomic policies should, inter alia, support employment creation, taking fully into account the social impact and dimension of globalization;
	19.	Also reaffirms that there is an urgent need to create an environment at the national and international levels that is conducive to the attainment of full and productive employment and decent work for all as a foundation for sustainable development and that an environment that supports investment, growth and entrepreneurship is essential to the creation of new job opportunities, and further reaffirms that opportunities for men and women to obtain productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity are essential to ensuring the eradication of hunger and poverty, the improvement of economic and social well-being for all, the achievement of sustained economic growth and sustainable development of all nations and a fully inclusive and equitable globalization;

Stresses the importance of removing obstacles to the realization of the right of peoples to self-determination, in particular of peoples living under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation, which adversely affect their social and economic development, including their exclusion from labour markets;
	21.	Reaffirms the need to address all forms of violence in its many manifestations, including domestic violence, particularly against women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities, and discrimination, including xenophobia, recognizes that violence increases challenges to States and societies in the achievement of poverty eradication, full and productive employment and decent work for all and social integration, and further recognizes that terrorism, trafficking in arms, organized crime, trafficking in persons, money-laundering, ethnic and religious conflict, civil war, politically motivated killing and genocide present fundamental threats to societies and pose increasing challenges to States and societies in the attainment of conditions conducive to social development, and that they further present urgent and compelling reasons for action by Governments individually and, as appropriate, jointly to foster social cohesion while recognizing, protecting and valuing diversity;
	22.	Requests the United Nations funds, programmes and agencies to mainstream the goal of full and productive employment and decent work for all in their policies, programmes and activities, as well as to support efforts of Member States aimed at achieving this objective, and invites financial institutions to support efforts in this regard;
	23.	Recognizes that promoting full employment and decent work also requires investing in education, training and skills development for women and men, and girls and boys, strengthening social protection and health systems and applying international labour standards;
	24.	Also recognizes that full and productive employment and decent work for all, which encompass social protection, fundamental principles and rights at work, tripartism and social dialogue, are key elements of sustainable development for all countries and are therefore a priority objective of international cooperation;
	25.	Encourages States to design and implement policies and strategies for poverty eradication, full employment and decent work for all, including the creation of full and productive employment that is appropriately and adequately remunerated, as well as policies and strategies for social integration that promote gender equality and the empowerment of women and address the specific needs of social groups such as young people, persons with disabilities, older persons, migrants and indigenous peoples, taking into account the concerns of these groups in the planning, implementation and evaluation of development programmes and policies;
	26.	Stresses the need to allocate adequate resources for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women in the workplace, including unequal access to labour market participation and wage inequalities, as well as reconciliation of work and private life for both women and men;

	29.	Stresses that the benefits of economic growth should be distributed more equitably and that, in order to close the gap of inequality and avoid any further deepening of inequality, comprehensive social policies and programmes, including appropriate social transfer and job creation programmes and social protection systems, are needed;
	30.	Recognizes the importance of providing social protection schemes for the formal and informal economy as instruments to achieve equity, inclusion and stability and cohesion of societies, and emphasizes the importance of supporting national efforts aimed at bringing informal workers into the formal economy;
	31.	Stresses that poverty eradication policies should, inter alia, ensure that people living in poverty have access to education, health, water and sanitation and other public and social services, as well as access to productive resources, including credit, land, training, technology, knowledge and information, and ensure that citizens and local communities participate in decision-making on social development policies and programmes in this regard;

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 8 December 2005
[on the report of the First Committee (A/60/463)]
60/55.	Compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation
and disarmament agreements


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 57/86 of 22 November 2002 and other relevant resolutions on the question,
	Recognizing the abiding concern of all Member States for maintaining respect for the rights and obligations arising from treaties to which they are parties and other sources of international law,
	Convinced that observance by Member States of the Charter of the United Nations and compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements to which they are parties and with other agreed obligations are essential for regional and global peace, security and stability, 
	Stressing that failure by States parties to comply with such agreements and other agreed obligations not only adversely affects the security of States parties but can also create security risks for other States relying on the constraints and commitments stipulated in those agreements,
	Stressing also that the viability and effectiveness of non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and other agreed obligations require that those agreements be fully complied with, 
	Concerned by non-compliance by some States with their respective obligations,
	Noting that verification and compliance, and enforcement in a manner consistent with the Charter, are integrally related,
	Recognizing that full compliance by States with their respective non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and other agreed obligations contributes to efforts to prevent the development and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their technologies and means of delivery contrary to international obligations, and to efforts to deny non-State actors access to such capabilities,
	1.	Underscores the contribution that compliance with non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and other agreed obligations makes to enhancing confidence and strengthening security and stability;
	2.	Urges all States to implement and to comply fully with their respective obligations;
	3.	Urges those States not currently in compliance with their respective obligations to make the strategic decision to come back into compliance with those obligations;
	4.	Calls upon all Member States to take concerted action in a manner consistent with relevant international law to encourage, through bilateral and multilateral means, the compliance by all States with their respective non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament agreements and other agreed obligations and to hold those not in compliance with such agreements accountable for their non-compliance in a manner consistent with the Charter of the United Nations;
	5.	Encourages efforts by all States parties, the United Nations and other international organizations, pursuant to their mandates, to take action, consistent with the Charter, to prevent serious damage to international security and stability arising from non-compliance by States with their existing non-proliferation, arms limitation and disarmament obligations;
	6.	Decides to remain seized of the matter.

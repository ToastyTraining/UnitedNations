		48/149.Situation of human rights in El Salvador
	

	The General Assembly,

	Guided by the international human rights instruments,

	Recalling its resolution 47/140 of 18 December 1992 and taking note of Commission on Human Rights resolution 1993/93 of 10 March 1993 1/ and the statement of 20 August 1993 by the Chairman of the Subcommission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities 2/ on support for the peace process in El Salvador, as well as Security Council resolution 888 (1993) of 30 November 1993,

	Taking into account the reports of the Secretary-General and the Director of the Human Rights Division of the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador,

	Convinced that full and speedy implementation of the outstanding commitments of the peace agreements is necessary in order to guarantee full respect for human rights and the consolidation of the reconciliation and democratization process under way in El Salvador,

	1/	See Official Records of the Economic and Social Council, 1993, Supplement No. 3 (E/1993/23), chap. II, sect. A.

	2/	See E/CN.4/1994/2-E/CN.4/Sub.2/1993/45, chap. VIII, para. 245.

	Welcoming the fact that most of the agreements have already been put into effect by the Government of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional,

	Concerned none the less that problems persist and that there are continuing delays in the implementation of several important elements of the peace agreements, referred to in Security Council resolution 832 (1993) of 27 May 1993, and that there have also been some irregularities in the implementation of those relating to public security,

	Noting with concern the recent acts of violence in El Salvador, which may indicate renewed activity by illegal armed groups and could, if left unchecked, negatively affect the peace process in El Salvador, including the elections scheduled for March 1994,

	Noting also with concern the seemingly politically motivated murders of, and threats against, members of the different political parties, including the Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional and the Alianza Republicana Nacionalista,

	Welcoming in this regard the efforts of the Secretary-General in cooperation with the Government of El Salvador towards the establishment of a mechanism to investigate illegal armed groups and their possible connection with renewed political violence,

	Noting that El Salvador has entered a decisive phase in the peace process and that political parties have just begun a campaign for the elections to be held in March 1994, which should take place in a peaceful environment,

	Noting the importance of the fact that reforms of the judicial system have been adopted, as well as the need for the adoption of both the reforms in the process of being approved and those recommended by the Commission on the Truth, 3/ which are designed to contribute to the elimination of the existing impunity and consequently to the full attainment of the rule of law, 

	Recalling the role that the Office of the National Counsel for the Defence of Human Rights is called upon to play in the promotion and protection of human rights,

	Considering that the international community must follow closely and continue to support all efforts to consolidate peace, ensure full respect for human rights and undertake the reconstruction of El Salvador,

	1.	Commends the Government of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional for having fulfilled most of their commitments and for having overcome a number of obstacles to the implementation of their agreements;


__________


	3/	See S/25500, annex.



	2.	Expresses its concern that there are important elements of the peace agreements that have been only partially implemented and therefore calls upon the Government of El Salvador and the Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional to step up their efforts to complete as agreed, by the proposed dates, the programme for the transfer of land, the reintegration programme for ex-combatants, the deployment of the National Civil Police and the phasing out of the National Police, as well as the collection of weapons issued for the exclusive use of personnel of the armed forces and the adoption of the Act on Private Security Services;


	3.	Condemns the recent acts of violence that may be politically motivated, which have been repudiated by the various sectors of Salvadorian society, and considers it inadmissible that such acts, perpetrated by a small minority, should jeopardize the progress made in implementing the agreements and hamper the holding of free elections in March 1994;

	4.	Supports, in this context, the efforts of the Secretary-General, in cooperation with the Government of El Salvador, to initiate immediately an impartial, independent and credible investigation of illegal armed groups, as recommended by the Commission on the Truth, 3/ and urges all sectors of society in El Salvador to cooperate with such an investigation;

	5.	Notes with satisfaction the statement of 5 November 1993, entitled "Commitment of the presidential candidates to peace and stability in El Salvador", in which the candidates, inter alia, solemnly committed themselves to maintaining the constructive evolution of the peace process and to implementing all the commitments contained in the peace agreements and rejected any politically motivated violence or intimidation;

	6.	Calls upon all Governments to contribute to the consolidation of peace and the attainment of full respect for human rights in El Salvador by supporting full compliance with the peace agreements;

	7.	Reiterates its gratitude for the important work being carried out by the Secretary-General and his representative and by the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador, and extends to them its support so that they can continue to take all necessary steps to contribute to the successful implementation of the peace agreements;

	8.	Acknowledges with satisfaction the continuing efforts of the Governments of Colombia, Mexico, Spain and Venezuela, which make up the Group of Friends of the Secretary-General, as well as the Government of the United States of America, in support of the steps being taken by the Secretary-General to consolidate the peace process in El Salvador;

	9.	Notes that, as has been pointed out by the Secretary-General, the human rights situation in El Salvador continues to evolve in a somewhat ambivalent fashion, since, on the one hand, there continue to be signs of improvement and, on the other, violations persist, particularly as regards the right to life, and the capacity of the judicial system to clarify and punish such violations continues to be unsatisfactory;





	10.	Urges all States, as well as the international financial and development institutions, promptly and generously to provide financial contributions to support the fulfilment of all aspects of the peace agreements, including the National Reconstruction Plan;

	11.	Urges the Government of El Salvador and all other institutions involved in the electoral process to adopt the necessary measures to create an atmosphere conducive to ensuring that the elections scheduled for March 1994 are free, representative and authentic, since they are a key element in  the consolidation of the peace process.

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Second Committee (A/49/731)]


49/124.United Nations University

	The General Assembly,

	Reaffirming its previous resolutions on the United Nations University,

	Having considered the report of the Council of the United Nations University on the work of the University in 1993, 1/ and its development in 1994, as presented orally by the Rector of the United Nations University on 7 November 1994, 2/

	Taking note of decision 4.2.2 adopted by the Executive Board of
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization at its one hundred and forty-fourth session, held in Paris from 25 April to 5 May 1994, 3/

	Expressing its deep appreciation for the voluntary contributions made to date by Governments and other public and private entities in support of the University,

	Noting with appreciation the efforts made by the Rector to reduce the administrative costs and consolidate the programme of the University, but concerned about the continuing financial difficulties it is experiencing,


	Noting with appreciation also the decision of the Council to carry out a forward-looking assessment of the work the University has undertaken under its medium-term perspective for 1990-1995 in order to determine its future course,

	Concerned that there is insufficient awareness of the work the University is doing, particularly among other United Nations organs, and that the results of that work are not used as extensively as they could be,

	Recognizing that the University is making a growing number of contributions as a global reservoir of ideas for the international community in general and the United Nations system in particular, and expecting that these contributions will increase in the course of its third decade of existence, which commences next year,

	1.	Welcomes the fact that the Council of the United Nations University has initiated a process of consolidating the programme of the University and bringing it into closer correspondence with the priorities and concerns of the United Nations and the world academic community and stresses the need to continue this process;

	2.	Requests, in this connection, the Council and the Rector of the United Nations University to take further steps to promote the visibility of the University, particularly among Member States, the United Nations and its agencies, to strengthen its links with them and to enhance the dissemination of the results of its work, and to include such steps in the report of the Council to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session;

	3.	Stresses the need to enhance further coordination and cooperation between the research and training centres of the University;

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to consider innovative measures to improve the communication and interaction between the University and the other bodies in the United Nations system and to ensure the integration of the work of the University into all relevant activities of the United Nations system, taking into account General Assembly resolution 47/199 of 22 December 1992, so that the United Nations system may draw more extensively upon the work of the University, and to submit a report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session;

	5.	Requests the Council and the Rector to continue to make efforts to ensure the efficiency and economy of the activities of the University as well as its financial transparency and accountability, and to intensify efforts to augment its Endowment Fund and to mobilize operating contributions and other programme and project support;

	6.	Also requests the Secretary-General to continue to make efforts to ensure and enhance the real value of the capital of the Endowment Fund of the University;


	7.	Appeals to the international community to make voluntary contributions to the University, in particular to its Endowment Fund.

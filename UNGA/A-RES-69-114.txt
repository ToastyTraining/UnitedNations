[on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/69/495)]
69/114.	Criminal accountability of United Nations officials and experts on mission


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 59/281 of 29 March 2005, in which it endorsed the recommendation of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations that the Secretary-General make available to the United Nations membership a comprehensive report on the issue of sexual exploitation and abuse in United Nations peacekeeping operations,1

	Recalling further its resolution 59/300 of 22 June 2005, in which it endorsed the recommendation of the Special Committee that a group of legal experts be established to provide advice on the best way to proceed so as to ensure that the original intent of the Charter of the United Nations can be achieved, namely, that United Nations staff and experts on mission would never be effectively exempt from the consequences of criminal acts committed at their duty station, nor unjustly penalized, without due process,3

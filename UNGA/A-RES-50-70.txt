50/70.General and complete disarmament

	A

	Nuclear testing

	The General Assembly,

	Welcoming the easing of international tension and the strengthening of trust between States that have prevailed following the end of the cold war,

	Reaffirming that the cessation of all nuclear testing will contribute to the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons in all its aspects, to the process of nuclear disarmament leading to the ultimate objective of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons and therefore to the further enhancement of international peace and security,

	Convinced that the cessation of all nuclear testing will provide a favourable climate for the conclusion of negotiations on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty,

	Considering that nuclear testing is not consistent with undertakings by the nuclear-weapon States at the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,

	Deeply concerned about the potential negative effects of underground nuclear testing on health and the environment,

	Sharing alarm expressed internationally, regionally and nationally at recent nuclear tests,

	1.	Commends those nuclear-weapon States observing nuclear testing moratoria, and urges them to continue those moratoria pending the entry into force of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty;

	2.	Strongly deplores all current nuclear testing;

	Realizing that arms obtained through the illicit arms trade are most likely to be used for violent purposes and that even small arms when so obtained, directly or indirectly, by terrorist groups, drug traffickers or underground organizations can pose a danger to regional and international security, and certainly to the security and political stability of the countries affected,

	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General to the Security Council entitled "Supplement to an Agenda for Peace", 2/ which stressed the urgent need for practical disarmament in the context of the conflicts the United Nations is actually dealing with and of the weapons, most of them light weapons, that are actually killing people in the hundreds of thousands, 3/ and which identified light weapons as including, inter alia, small arms and anti-personnel land-mines,

	Recalling its resolution 49/75 G of 15 December 1994, in which it welcomed the initiative taken by Mali concerning the question of the illicit circulation of small arms and their collection in the affected States of the Saharo-Sahelian subregion, as well as the action taken by the Secretary-General in implementation of this initiative,


	Noting the work of the Disarmament Commission on international arms transfers,

	1.	Requests the Secretary-General, within the existing resources, to prepare a report, with the assistance of a panel group of qualified governmental experts to be nominated by him on the basis of equitable geographical representation, on:

	(a)	The types of small arms and light weapons actually being used in conflicts being dealt with by the United Nations;

with particular attention to the role of the United Nations in this field and to the complementary role of regional organizations, and taking into account views and proposals of Member States and all other relevant information, for submission to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session;

	2.	Also requests the Secretary-General to seek the views and proposals of Member States on the matters mentioned in paragraph 1 above, to collect all other relevant information and to make them available for consideration by the panel of governmental experts referred to in paragraph 1 above;

	Convinced that endeavours by countries to promote regional disarmament, taking into account the specific characteristics of each region and in accordance with the principle of undiminished security at the lowest level of armaments, would enhance the security of smaller States and would thus contribute to international peace and security by reducing the risk of regional conflicts,

	1.	Stresses that sustained efforts are needed, within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament and under the umbrella of the United Nations, to make progress on the entire range of disarmament issues;

	2.	Affirms that global and regional approaches to disarmament complement each other and should therefore be pursued simultaneously to promote regional and international peace and security;

	3.	Calls upon States to conclude agreements, wherever possible, for nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and confidence-building measures at the regional and subregional levels;

	4.	Welcomes the initiatives towards disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and security undertaken by some countries at the regional and subregional levels;

	5.	Supports and encourages efforts aimed at promoting confidence-building measures at the regional and subregional levels in order to ease regional tensions and to further disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation measures at the regional and subregional levels;

	6.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-first session the item entitled "Regional disarmament".

Conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolutions 48/75 J of 16 December 1993 and 49/75 O of 15 December 1994,

	Recognizing the crucial role of conventional arms control in promoting regional and international peace and security,

	Convinced that conventional arms control needs to be pursued primarily in the regional and subregional contexts since most threats to peace and security in the post-cold-war era arise mainly among States located in the same region or subregion,

	Aware that the preservation of a balance in the defence capabilities of States at the lowest level of armaments would contribute to peace and stability and should be a prime objective of conventional arms control,


	Desirous of promoting agreements to strengthen regional peace and security at the lowest possible level of armaments and military forces,

	Believing that militarily significant States, and States with larger military capabilities, have a special responsibility in promoting such agreements for regional security,

	Believing also that two of the principal objectives of conventional arms control should be to prevent the possibility of military attack launched by surprise and to avoid aggression,

	1.	Decides to give urgent consideration to the issues involved in conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels;

	2.	Requests the Conference on Disarmament, as a first step, to consider the formulation of principles that can serve as a framework for regional agreements on conventional arms control, and looks forward to a report of the Conference on this subject;





	3.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-first session the item entitled "Conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels".

	M

	Observance of environmental norms in the drafting
	and implementation of agreements on disarmament  
	and arms control

	The General Assembly,

	Recognizing the importance of the observance of environmental norms in the drafting and implementation of agreements on disarmament and arms limitation,

	Taking note of the relevant provisions of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction 27/ regarding the environment,

	Convinced of the importance of the environmentally sound implementation of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction, 28/

	Mindful of the detrimental environmental effects of the use of nuclear weapons,

	Conscious of the positive potential implications for the environment of a future comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty,


	Desirous of banning effectively military or any other hostile use of environment modification techniques, with a view to removing the dangers for mankind that might arise from such uses,

	1.	Invites the Conference on Disarmament to take every necessary measure to include in negotiating treaties and agreements on disarmament and arms limitation the corresponding environmental norms, with a view to ensuring that the process of implementation of such treaties and agreements is environmentally sound, in particular the destruction of weapons covered by them;

	2.	Emphasizes the importance of the compliance of all States parties to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction, and calls upon them to cooperate and ensure that the process of implementation of the Convention in all relevant aspects is environmentally sound;

	3.	Urges all States parties to consider all relevant norms related to the protection of the environment in implementing the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction;

	4.	Calls upon the Conference on Disarmament to conclude, as a task of the highest priority, a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty as soon as possible in 1996;

	5.	Urges the States that are not yet party to the Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques 29/ to consider adhering to it as soon as possible, in order to assure the universality of the Convention.

	N

	Bilateral nuclear arms negotiations and nuclear disarmament

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its previous relevant resolutions,

	Recognizing the fundamental changes that have taken place with respect to international security, which have permitted agreements on deep reductions in the nuclear armaments of the States possessing the largest inventories of such weapons,

	Mindful that it is the responsibility and obligation of all States to contribute to the process of the relaxation of international tension and to the strengthening of international peace and security,

	Stressing the importance of strengthening international peace and security through disarmament,

	Emphasizing that nuclear disarmament remains one of the principal tasks of our times,


	Appreciating a number of positive developments in the field of nuclear disarmament, in particular the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, concluded
on 8 December 1987, 25/ and the treaties on the reduction and limitation of strategic offensive arms,

	Noting that there are still significant nuclear arsenals and that the primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament, with the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons, rests with the nuclear-weapon States, in particular those which possess the largest stockpiles,

	Noting also the expressed determination of the nuclear-weapon States to pursue systematic and progressive efforts to reduce nuclear weapons globally, with the ultimate goal of eliminating those weapons within a time-bound framework,

	Welcoming the steps that have already been taken by those States to begin the process of reducing the number of nuclear weapons and removing such weapons from a deployed status, and bilateral agreements on the issue of de-targeting strategic nuclear missiles,

	Noting the new climate of relations between the United States of America and the States of the former Soviet Union, which permits them to intensify their cooperative efforts to ensure the safety, security and environmentally sound destruction of nuclear weapons,

	Noting also that the Russian Federation and the United States of America concurred that, once the Treaty on Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms 5/ was ratified, they would proceed to deactivate all nuclear delivery systems to be reduced under the Treaty by removing their nuclear warheads or taking other steps to remove them from alert status,

	Noting further the agreement between the Russian Federation and the United States of America to intensify their dialogue to compare conceptual approaches and to develop concrete steps to adapt the nuclear forces and practices on both sides to the changed international security situation, including the possibility, after ratification of the Treaty on Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, of further reductions of and limitations on remaining nuclear forces,

	Taking note of the joint statement of 10 May 1995 by the Russian Federation and the United States of America on the Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic Missile Systems,

	Urging the early ratification of the Treaty on the Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms and further intensification of such efforts to accelerate the implementation of agreements and unilateral decisions relating to nuclear-arms reduction,

	Welcoming the reduction made by other nuclear-weapon States, in some of their nuclear-weapon programmes, and encouraging all nuclear-weapon States to consider appropriate measures relating to nuclear disarmament,

	Affirming that bilateral and multilateral negotiations on nuclear disarmament should facilitate and complement each other,


	1.	Welcomes the entry into force of the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, 4/ signed in Moscow on 31 July 1991 by the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the United States of America, including the Protocol to that Treaty signed at Lisbon on 23 May 1992 by the parties thereto, and the exchange of documents of ratification between the United States of America, Belarus, Kazakstan, the Russian Federation and Ukraine on 5 December 1994 at Budapest;

	2.	Also welcomes the signing of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Russian Federation on Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms in Moscow on 3 January 1993, 5/ and urges the parties to take the steps necessary to bring that Treaty into force at the earliest possible date;

	3.	Expresses its satisfaction at the fact that the entry into force of the 1991 Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms clears the way to prompt ratification by the Russian Federation and the United States of America of the 1993 Treaty;

	4.	Also expresses its satisfaction at the continuing implementation of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on the Elimination of Their Intermediate-Range and Shorter-Range Missiles, 25/ in particular at the completion by the parties of the destruction of all their declared missiles subject to elimination under the Treaty;

	5.	Encourages the United States of America, the Russian Federation, Belarus, Kazakstan and Ukraine to continue their cooperative efforts aimed at eliminating nuclear weapons and strategic offensive arms on the basis of existing agreements, and welcomes the contributions that other States are making to such cooperation as well;

	6.	Encourages and supports the Russian Federation and the United States of America in their efforts to reduce their nuclear armaments and to continue to give those efforts the highest priority in order to contribute to the objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework;

	7.	Invites the Russian Federation and the United States of America to keep other States Members of the United Nations and the Conference on Disarmament duly informed of progress in their discussions and in the implementation of their strategic offensive arms agreements and unilateral decisions;

	8.	Calls on the Conference on Disarmament to take this information into account in the negotiations to be held on nuclear disarmament and for the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework.

	O

	Moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling with satisfaction its resolutions 48/75 K of 16 December 1993 and 49/75 D of 15 December 1994, in which it, inter alia, called upon States to agree to a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines that pose grave dangers to civilian populations, and urged States to implement moratoria on the export of anti-personnel land-mines,


	Also recalling with satisfaction its resolution 49/75 D, in which it, inter alia, established as a goal of the international community the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines,

	Noting that, according to the 1994 report of the Secretary-General entitled "Assistance in mine clearance", 30/ it is estimated that there are more than one hundred and ten land-mines in the ground in more than sixty countries throughout the world,

	Noting also that, according to the same report, the global land-mine crisis continues to worsen as an estimated two to five million new land-mines are laid each year, while only an estimated one hundred thousand were cleared in 1994,

	Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people every week, mostly innocent and defenceless civilians, obstruct economic development and reconstruction, and have other severe consequences for years after emplacement, which include inhibiting the repatriation of refugees and the return of internally displaced persons,

	Gravely concerned over the suffering and casualties caused to non-combatants as a result of the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines,

	Recalling with satisfaction its resolutions 48/7 of 19 October 1993 and 49/215 A of 23 December 1994 calling for assistance in mine clearance,

	Welcoming the programmes of assistance that exist for demining and humanitarian support for the victims of anti-personnel land-mines,

	Welcoming also the International Meeting on Mine Clearance, held at Geneva from 5 to 7 July 1995, and noting the statement of the Secretary-General at the meeting that the international community must take specific and tangible steps to address the intolerable situation caused by the proliferation of anti-personnel land-mines throughout the world,

	Recalling with satisfaction the report of the Secretary-General concerning progress on the initiative in resolution 49/75 D, 31/

	Convinced that moratoria by States on the export of anti-personnel land-mines that pose grave dangers to civilian populations are important measures in helping to reduce substantially the human and economic costs resulting from the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of such devices,

	Noting with satisfaction that more than twenty-five States already have declared moratoria on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel land-mines, with many of these moratoria being declared as a result of the aforementioned resolutions,

	Believing that ongoing efforts to strengthen the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, 32/ in particular Protocol II thereto, 33/ are an essential part of the overall effort to address problems caused by the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines,


	Noting the efforts that were made at the Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention, held at Vienna from 25 September to 13 October 1995, to strengthen prohibitions and restrictions in Protocol II governing land-mine use and transfer, and urging parties to build consensus towards agreement on such prohibitions and restrictions when the Review Conference reconvenes in January and April 1996,

	Believing that, in addition to Protocol II, other measures to control the production, stockpiling and transfer of anti-personnel land-mines are also necessary to address problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, especially the indiscriminate or illegal use of anti-personnel land-mines that continue to inflict harm on civilian populations long after emplacement,

	Recognizing that States can move most effectively towards the goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines as viable alternatives are developed that significantly reduce the risk to the civilian population, and emphasizing the need for States to work on developing such alternatives on an urgent basis,

	1.	Welcomes the moratoria already declared by certain States on the export of anti-personnel land-mines;

	2.	Urges States that have not yet done so to declare such moratoria at the earliest possible date;

	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to prepare a report on steps taken by Member States to implement such moratoria, and to submit it to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session under the item entitled "General and complete disarmament";

	4.	Emphasizes the importance of the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects and Protocol II thereto as the authoritative international instrument governing the responsible use of anti-personnel land-mines and related devices, and urges parties to build consensus towards an agreement when the Review Conference reconvenes;

	5.	Encourages the widest possible accession to the Convention and to Protocol II thereto, and further urges all States to comply immediately and fully with the applicable rules of Protocol II;

	6.	Also encourages further immediate international efforts to seek solutions to the problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, with a view to the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines.

	P

	Nuclear disarmament

	The General Assembly,

	Reaffirming the commitment of the international community to the goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons and the creation of a nuclear-weapon-free world,

	Determined to achieve the objective of prohibiting the development, production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons and their destruction, and to conclude such an international treaty or treaties at an early date,

	Bearing in mind paragraph 50 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly, 19/ the first special session devoted to disarmament, calling for the urgent negotiation of agreements for the cessation of the qualitative improvement and development of nuclear-weapon systems, and for a comprehensive and phased programme with agreed time-frames, wherever feasible, for progressive and balanced reduction of nuclear weapons and their means of delivery, leading to their ultimate and complete elimination at the earliest possible time,

	Recognizing that a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty, the proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices and a convention prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons constitute important steps towards the elimination of the nuclear threat, and will contribute to the achievement of the goal of nuclear disarmament within a time-bound framework,

	Recognizing also that the end of the cold war has brought about favourable conditions for creating a world free of nuclear weapons,

	Welcoming the entry into force of the Treaty on the Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, 4/ to which Belarus, Kazakstan, the Russian Federation, Ukraine and the United States of America are States parties, as well as the conclusion of the Treaty on Further Reduction and Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms 5/ by the Russian Federation and the United States of America, and looking forward to full implementation of these treaties and to further concrete steps for nuclear disarmament by all nuclear-weapon States,

	Noting with appreciation the unilateral measures of nuclear-weapon States for nuclear arms limitation,

	Recognizing the complementarity of bilateral and multilateral negotiations on nuclear disarmament and that bilateral negotiations can never replace multilateral negotiations in this respect,

	Recognizing also that a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty and the proposed treaty on fissile material for nuclear weapons or other explosive devices must both constitute disarmament measures and not only non-proliferation measures, and that they must be important steps leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework,


	Noting the support expressed in the Conference on Disarmament and in the General Assembly for the elaboration of an international convention to assure non-nuclear-weapon States against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons, and the multilateral efforts in the Conference on Disarmament to reach agreement on such an international convention at an early date,

	Recalling its resolution 49/75 E of 15 December 1994 on a step-by-step reduction of the nuclear threat,

	Taking note of paragraph 84 and other relevant recommendations in the Final Document of the Eleventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of the Non-Aligned Countries, held at Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, from 18 to 20 October 1995, calling on the Conference on Disarmament to establish, on a priority basis, an ad hoc committee to commence negotiations early in 1996 on a phased programme of nuclear disarmament and for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework,

	1.	Recognizes that, in view of the end of the cold war and recent political developments, the time is now opportune for all nuclear-weapon States to undertake effective nuclear disarmament measures with a view to the total elimination of these weapons within a time-bound framework;

	2.	Also recognizes that there is a genuine need to de-emphasize the role of nuclear weapons, and to review and revise nuclear doctrines accordingly;

	3.	Urges the nuclear-weapon States to stop immediately the qualitative improvement, development, stockpiling and production of nuclear warheads and their delivery systems;

	4.	Calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to undertake step-by-step reduction of the nuclear threat and a phased programme of progressive and balanced deep reductions of nuclear weapons, and to carry out effective nuclear disarmament measures with a view to the total elimination of these weapons within a time-bound framework;

	5.	Calls upon the Conference on Disarmament to establish, on a priority basis, an ad hoc committee on nuclear disarmament to commence negotiations early in 1996 on a phased programme of nuclear disarmament and for the eventual elimination of nuclear weapons within a time-bound framework;

	6.	Expresses its support for the efforts of the Member States of the Conference on Disarmament to this end;

	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session a report on the implementation of the present resolution;

	8.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-first session the item entitled "Nuclear disarmament".

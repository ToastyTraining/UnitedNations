	2.	Takes note with deep concern of the observations contained in paragraphs 5 and 6 of the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions3 to the effect that little had been done to meet the explicit concerns of the Advisory Committee concerning the quality of information provided by the Secretary-General and that the lack of a reply to requests for clarification or additional information in particular areas had affected a specific recommendation of the Committee;

	3.	Notes with concern that the extension of the deadline for the submission of applications for the replacement of type II gratis personnel has resulted in cases of differential treatment among Member States;

	4.	Takes note of the commitment and assurances of the Secretary-General that the recruitment process for the replacement of type II gratis personnel, including those in the two international tribunals,4 will be completed by 28 February 1999, in accordance with its resolutions 52/234 and 52/248;

	5.	Reaffirms its decision contained in paragraph 16 of its resolution 52/248 to approve four hundred support account-funded temporary posts for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999;

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General, when determining the allocation of the four hundred support account-funded temporary posts, including the six additional posts, to take into account the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee,3 subject to the provisions of the present resolution;

	7.	Also requests the Secretary-General to include in his support account submission for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000 a comprehensive review of a rapidly deployable mission headquarters, addressing particularly the differences between its functional responsibilities  and those of the Mission Planning Service of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of the Secretariat, and further to develop the concept for its employment during the initial phase of a new peacekeeping operation, as mentioned by the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations in paragraph 101 of its report,5 referred to by the Advisory Committee in its report,6 and address the issues raised and comments and observations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee;

	8.	Decides to establish, within the level of the four hundred support account-funded temporary posts approved for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, two civilian posts at the P-4 level (one Humanitarian Affairs Officer and one Civilian Police Officer) for a rapidly deployable mission headquarters, and to revert to the issue of the other proposed positions in the context of its consideration of the information requested in paragraph 7 above;


	9.	Takes note of the observations contained in paragraph 21 of the report of the Advisory Committee,3 and decides to establish one post at the P-4 level for the Office of Internal Oversight Services of the Secretariat;

	10.	Regrets that a comprehensive review of the issues raised in its resolutions 50/221 B, 51/239 A and B and 52/248 has not been carried out, and requests the Secretary-General, in the context of his support account submission for the period from 1 July 1999 to 30 June 2000, to give a detailed account of the implementation of these and the current resolutions, including the revised structures of those departments involved in backstopping peacekeeping operations, redeployment, duplication, overlap, fragmentation, the evolution in peacekeeping trends, changes in workload and other issues raised by the Advisory Committee  in paragraphs 8, 15, 27, 34, 35 and 41 of its report,3 and to report to the General Assembly thereon.

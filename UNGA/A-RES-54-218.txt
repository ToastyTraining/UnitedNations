                                                                          3 February 2000

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Second Committee (A/54/588/Add.1)]


54/218.	Implementation of and follow-up to the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development and the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly

    The General Assembly,

    Recalling the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, held at Rio de Janeiro from 3 to 14 June 1992, and the nineteenth special session of the General Assembly for the purpose of an overall review and appraisal of the implementation of Agenda 21, held in New York from 23 to 28 June 1997,

    Reaffirming that Agenda 211 is the fundamental programme of action for achieving sustainable development and that the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21,2 adopted by the General Assembly at its nineteenth special session, will enhance the full implementation of the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development,


    Recognizing that the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21 includes a statement of commitment to Agenda 21 and the goals of sustainable development, an assessment of progress made since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in all main areas of Agenda 21 and other outcomes of the Conference, and recommendations on the future methods of work of the Commission on Sustainable Development and the programme of work of the Commission for the period 1998-2002,

    Recognizing also that mutually supportive efforts at the national and international levels are needed in the pursuit of sustainable development and that the gap between developed and developing countries points to the continuing need for a dynamic and enabling national and international economic environment that is supportive of international cooperation, in particular in the fields of finance, transfer of  technology, debt and trade, if the momentum for global progress towards sustainable development is to be maintained and increased,

    Noting with concern that, during the assessment and review of progress made at its nineteenth special session, the General Assembly concluded that although some progress had been made, especially at the local level, the overall trends with respect to the global environment had not improved, and emphasizing that the implementation of Agenda 21 in a comprehensive manner remains vitally important and is now more urgent than ever,

    Noting that the next review of the implementation of Agenda 21 is to be carried out by the General Assembly in 2002,

    Noting also the need for early substantive preparations for the ten-year review of the implementation of the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in order to attain meaningful results,

    Recalling General Assembly resolution 53/188 of 15 December 1998 and Commission on Sustainable Development decision 7/9,3 on preparations for the review of the implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21,

    4.

    5.	Reaffirms, in this context, the necessity of providing adequate and predictable financial resources, transferring environmentally sound technologies and providing capacity-building and technical assistance to developing countries for the implementation of Agenda 21 and for the achievement of the long-term goals of sustainable development, and calls for the preparations for the ten-year review of the implementation of the outcome of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, without prejudice to other priority areas that may be identified during the preparatory process, to address the challenges and constraints in the implementation of the commitments of the Conference at all levels and to identify ways and means of accelerating the implementation of Agenda 21, including the development of measures to remedy the slow rate of progress of the international community in implementing Agenda 21;

    6.	Notes the need for assistance to be provided by the international community to countries with economies in transition in their efforts to achieve the objectives of Agenda 21 and the long-term goals of sustainable development;

    7.	Emphasizes the importance of the continued active and collaborative involvement of all relevant bodies of the United Nations system in the implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21, and requests the Secretary-General, in close collaboration with all relevant bodies of the United Nations system and taking into account the outcome of the deliberations in the Commission on Sustainable Development, to submit to the General Assembly for consideration at its fifty-fifth session, through the Economic and Social Council in view of its coordination function, an analytical report on the measures taken within the United Nations system to accelerate the implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21, including the identification of constraints and recommendations on how to address those constraints;

    8.	Recognizes the importance, for the effective implementation of Agenda 21 and the Programme for the Further Implementation of Agenda 21, of a multifaceted approach at the local, national, regional and global levels, as well as of the continued involvement of major groups, as defined in Agenda 21, and calls for the preparations for the ten-year review to facilitate continued involvement and input from those various levels and from major groups;

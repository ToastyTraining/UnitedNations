	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

49/51.Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its forty-sixth session


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the International Law Commission on the work of its forty-sixth session, 1/

	Emphasizing the need for the progressive development of international law and its codification in order to make it a more effective means of implementing the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and in the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations 2/ and to give increased importance to its role in relations among States,

	Recognizing the importance of referring legal and drafting questions to the Sixth Committee, including topics that might be submitted to the International Law Commission, and of enabling the Sixth Committee and the Commission further to enhance their contribution to the progressive development of international law and its codification,

	Recalling the need to keep under review those topics of international law which, given their new or renewed interest for the international community, may be suitable for the progressive development and codification of international law and therefore may be included in the future programme of work of the International Law Commission,

	2/	Resolution 2625 (XXV), annex.




	Recognizing also the role of the International Law Commission in the fulfilment of the objectives of the United Nations Decade of International Law,

	Considering that experience has demonstrated the usefulness of structuring the debate on the report of the International Law Commission in the Sixth Committee in such a manner that conditions are provided for concentrated attention on each of the main topics dealt with in the report, and that this process is facilitated when the Commission indicates specific issues on which expressions of views by Governments are of particular interest for the continuation of its work,

	1.	Takes note of the report of the International Law Commission on the work of its forty-sixth session;

	2.	Expresses its appreciation to the International Law Commission for the work accomplished at that session, in particular for the completion of a draft statute for an international criminal court 3/ and the adoption of final draft articles on the law of the non-navigational uses of international watercourses; 4/

	3.	Recommends that, taking into account the comments of Governments, whether in writing or expressed orally in debates in the General Assembly, the International Law Commission should continue its work on the topics in its current programme;

	4.	Notes the intentions of the International Law Commission for the programme of work for the remainder of the current term of office of its members, 5/ and urges the Commission to resume, at its forty-seventh session, the work on the draft Code of Crimes against the Peace and Security of Mankind and on State responsibility in such a manner that the second reading of the draft articles of the Code and the first reading of the draft articles on State responsibility may be completed before the end of the present term of office of the members of the Commission;

	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to update the survey of State practice relevant to international liability for injurious consequences arising out of acts not prohibited by international law, prepared by the Secretariat in 1984, 6/ as a useful contribution to the ongoing work of the Commission on the topic;

	7.	Expresses its appreciation for the efforts of the International Law Commission to improve its procedures and methods of work;

	8.	Requests the International Law Commission:

	(i)	The planning of its activities and programme for the term of office of its members, bearing in mind the desirability of achieving as much progress as possible in the preparation of draft articles on specific topics;

	9.	Takes note of the comments of the International Law Commission on the question of the duration of its session, as presented in its report, 7/ and expresses the view that the requirements of the work for the progressive development of international law and its codification and the magnitude and complexity of the subjects on the agenda of the Commission make it desirable that the usual duration of its sessions be maintained;

	10.	Reaffirms its previous decisions concerning the role of the Codification Division of the Office of Legal Affairs of the Secretariat and those concerning the summary records and other documentation of the International Law Commission;

 	11.	Once again expresses the wish that seminars will continue to be held in conjunction with the sessions of the International Law Commission and that an increasing number of participants from developing countries will be given the opportunity to attend those seminars, appeals to States that can do so to make the voluntary contributions that are urgently needed for the holding of the seminars, and requests the Secretary-General to provide the seminars, from within existing resources, with adequate services, including interpretation, as required;

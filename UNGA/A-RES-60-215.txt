	Recalling the objectives formulated in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 notably the Millennium Development Goals, and the reaffirmation they have received in the 2005 World Summit Outcome,2 particularly in regard to developing partnerships through the provision of greater opportunities to the private sector, non-governmental organizations and civil society in general so as to enable them to contribute to the realization of the goals and programmes of the Organization, in particular in the pursuit of development and the eradication of poverty,
	Underlining the fact that cooperation between the United Nations and all relevant partners, including the private sector, shall serve the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and can make concrete contributions to the realization of the Millennium Development Goals and the other goals contained in the Millennium Declaration, as well as in the outcomes of major United Nations conferences and summits and their reviews, in particular in the area of development and the eradication of poverty, and shall be undertaken in a manner that maintains the integrity, impartiality and independence of the Organization,
	Underlining also the importance of the contribution of the private sector, non-governmental organizations and civil society in general to the implementation of the outcomes of United Nations conferences in the economic, social and related fields,
	Welcoming, in this regard, the participation of civil society and private-sector entities in the multi-stakeholder consultations on development finance issues, whose findings were presented at the High-level Dialogue on Financing for Development held in New York on 27 and 28 June 2005,
	Emphasizing that all relevant partners, including the private sector, can contribute in several ways to addressing the obstacles confronted by developing countries in mobilizing the resources needed to finance their sustainable development and to the realization of the development goals of the United Nations through, inter alia, financial resources, access to technology, management expertise and support for programmes, including through the reduced pricing of drugs, where appropriate, for the prevention, care and treatment of HIV/AIDS and other diseases,
	Welcoming the efforts and encouraging further efforts by all relevant partners, including the private sector, to engage as reliable and consistent partners in the development process and to take into account not only the economic and financial, but also the developmental, social, human rights, gender and environmental implications of their undertakings and, in general, towards accepting and implementing the principle of good corporate citizenship, that is, bringing social values and responsibilities to bear on a conduct and policy premised on profit incentives, in conformity with national laws and regulations,
	Noting that, in line with Economic and Social Council resolution 2003/61 of 25 July 2003, the secretariat of the Commission on Sustainable Development is continuing its efforts to promote partnerships for sustainable development, inter alia, through the establishment of an interactive online database, the preparation of a report on partnerships for sustainable development to the Commission at its twelfth session, in 2004, the holding of a partnership fair at its twelfth and thirteenth sessions, in 2004 and 2005, respectively, and prospectively at its fourteenth session, in 2006, in line with the determination by the Council that partnerships for sustainable development, as voluntary multi-stakeholder initiatives, contribute to the implementation of Agenda 213 and the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development ("Johannesburg Plan of Implementation"),4
	Welcoming the implementation and expansion of the database of the Commission on Sustainable Development and its increasing use as a platform to provide access to information on partnerships and facilitate the exchange of experiences and best practices,

	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on enhanced cooperation between the United Nations and all relevant partners, in particular the private sector;5
	2.	Stresses that partnerships are voluntary and collaborative relationships between various parties, both public and non-public, in which all participants agree to work together to achieve a common purpose or undertake a specific task and, as mutually agreed, to share risks and responsibilities, resources and benefits;
	3.	Also stresses the importance of the contribution of voluntary partnerships to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, while reiterating that they are a complement to, but not intended to substitute for, the commitments made by Governments with a view to achieving these goals;
	4.	Further stresses that partnerships should be consistent with national laws and national development strategies and plans, as well as the priorities of countries where their implementation takes place, bearing in mind the relevant guidance provided by Governments;
	5.	Recalls that the 2005 World Summit welcomed the positive contributions of the private sector and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, in the promotion and implementation of development and human rights programmes and also welcomed the dialogue between those organizations and Member States, as reflected in the first informal interactive hearings of the General Assembly with representatives of non-governmental organizations, civil society and the private sector;
	6.	Also recalls that the 2005 World Summit resolved to enhance the contribution of non-governmental organizations, civil society, the private sector and other stakeholders in national development efforts, as well as in the promotion of the global partnership for development, and encouraged public-private partnerships in the following areas: the generation of new investments and employment, financing for development, health, agriculture, conservation, sustainable use of natural resources and environmental management, energy, forestry and the impact of climate change;
	7.	Encourages the United Nations system to continue to develop, for those partnerships in which it participates, a common and systemic approach which places greater emphasis on impact, transparency, accountability and sustainability, without imposing undue rigidity in partnership agreements, and with due consideration being given to the following partnership principles: common purpose, transparency, bestowing no unfair advantages upon any partner of the United Nations, mutual benefit and mutual respect, accountability, respect for the modalities of the United Nations, striving for balanced representation of relevant partners from developed and developing countries and countries with economies in transition, sectoral and geographic balance, and not compromising the independence and neutrality of the United Nations system in general and the agencies in particular;

	9.	Further encourages the Global Compact Office to promote the sharing of best practices and positive action through learning, dialogue and partnerships;

	11.	Takes note with appreciation of the appointment by the Secretary-General of a Special Adviser on the Global Compact;
	12.	Requests the Secretary-General to take further appropriate action to enhance partnership management through the promotion of: adequate training at all concerned levels; institutional capacity in country offices; strategic focus and local ownership; the sharing of best practices; the improvement of partner selection processes; and the streamlining of United Nations guidelines for partnerships between the United Nations and all relevant partners, including the private sector, and further requests the Secretary-General to report on these actions in the context of his report under the item entitled "Towards global partnerships";
	13.	Also requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with Member States, to promote, within existing resources, impact-assessment mechanisms, taking into account best tools available, in order to enable effective management, ensure accountability and facilitate effective learning from both successes and failures;
	14.	Welcomes innovative approaches to use partnerships as a means to better implement goals and programmes, in particular in the pursuit of development and the eradication of poverty, and encourages relevant United Nations bodies and agencies and invites the Bretton Woods institutions and the World Trade Organization to further explore such possibilities, bearing in mind their different mandates, modes of operation and objectives, as well as the particular roles of the non-public partners involved;
	15.	Recommends, in this context, that partnerships should also foster the elimination of all forms of discrimination, including on gender grounds, in respect of employment and occupation;
	16.	Reiterates its call upon:
	(a)	All bodies within the United Nations system that engage in partnerships to ensure the integrity and independence of the Organization and to include information on partnerships in their regular reporting, as appropriate, on their websites and through other means;
	(b)	Partners to provide to and exchange relevant information with Governments, other stakeholders and the relevant United Nations agencies and bodies and other international organizations with which they engage, in an appropriate way, including through reports, with particular attention to the importance of sharing among partnerships information on their practical experience;

	Remaining convinced that the need for disarmament and non-proliferation education, particularly among youth, has never been greater, not only on the subject of weapons of mass destruction but also in the field of small arms and light weapons, terrorism and other challenges to international security and the process of disarmament, as well as on the relevance of implementing the recommendations contained in the United Nations study,
	Recognizing the importance of the participation of civil society, including academic and non-governmental organizations, which plays an active role in the promotion of disarmament and non-proliferation education,
	1.	Expresses its appreciation to the Member States, the United Nations and other international and regional organizations, civil society, academic and non-governmental organizations, which, within their purview, implemented the recommendations made in the United Nations study,2 as discussed in the report of the Secretary-General reviewing the implementation of the recommendations,1 and encourages them once again to continue applying those recommendations and reporting to the Secretary-General on steps taken to implement them;

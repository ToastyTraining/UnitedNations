	9.	Stresses that the purpose of reform is to make the United Nations development system more efficient and effective in its support to developing countries to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, on the basis of their national development strategies, and stresses also that reform efforts should enhance organizational efficiency and achieve concrete development results;
	10.	Requests the United Nations development system to continue its efforts to respond to national development plans, policies and priorities, which constitute the only viable frame of reference for programming operational activities at the country level, and to pursue full integration of operational activities for development at the country level with national planning and programming, under the leadership of national Governments, at all stages of the process, while ensuring the full involvement of all relevant stakeholders at the national level;
	11.	Recognizes that strengthening the role and capacity of the United Nations development system to assist countries in achieving their development goals requires continuing improvement in its effectiveness, efficiency, coherence and impact, along with a significant increase in resources and an expansion of its resource base on a continuous, more predictable and assured basis;
	12.	Encourages the Secretary-General, through the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination and the United Nations Development Group, as appropriate, to make efforts to enhance the coherence, effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations development system;
	13.

Funding for operational activities of the United Nations development system
	17.	Acknowledges efforts by developed countries to increase resources for development, including commitments by some developed countries to increase official development assistance, notes with concern the overall decline in official development assistance in 2006, calls for the fulfilment of all official development assistance commitments, including the commitments by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance by 2015 and to reach at least 0.5 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance by 2010, as well as the target of 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent for least developed countries, and urges those developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete efforts in this regard in accordance with their commitments;
	18.	Stresses that core resources, because of their untied nature, continue to be the bedrock of the operational activities for development of the United Nations system, and in this regard notes with concern that the share of core contributions to United Nations funds and programmes has declined in recent years, and recognizes the need for organizations to address, on a continuous basis, the imbalance between core and non-core resources;
	19.

	23.	Requests the United Nations funds and programmes, and urges the specialized agencies to avoid using core/regular resources to cover costs related to the management of extrabudgetary funds and their programme activities;
	24.	Stresses that the mobilization and management of extrabudgetary resources should not adversely impact the quality of the delivery of the programme of work of the funds, programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations development system;
	25.	Notes with concern that, based on assessed contributions, the regular budgets of many specialized agencies have been stagnating, and invites countries to consider increasing their contributions to the budgets of the specialized agencies in order to enable the United Nations development system to respond in a more comprehensive and effective manner to the demands of the United Nations development agenda;
	26.	Recognizes the urgent and specific needs of low-income countries, in particular the least developed countries, and stresses the need to continue to assist those countries, including through the existing institutions and funding mechanisms of the United Nations development system;
	27.	Also recognizes that middle-income developing countries still face significant challenges in the area of poverty eradication and that efforts to address those challenges should be supported in order to ensure that achievements made to date are sustained, including through support to the effective development of comprehensive cooperation policies;
	28.	Requests the Secretary-General, making use of existing capacities within the Secretariat and, if necessary, voluntary contributions:

	Reaffirming the importance of phase II (1992-1996) of the Transport and Communications Decade for Asia and the Pacific,

	1.	Requests the Governing Council of the United Nations Development Programme to keep under review the level of funding to be provided for the implementation of the regional action programme, so that phase II (1992-1996) of the Transport and Communications Decade for Asia and the Pacific will have a greater impact;

	2.	Requests bilateral donors to take note of General Assembly decision 46/453, so as to ensure that the programme approved by the Meeting of Ministers Responsible for Transport and Communications, held at Bangkok from 3 to 5 June 1992, will be implemented effectively;

	3.	Invites all Governments in a position to do so to contribute to the implementation of the programme approved by the Meeting of Ministers Responsible for Transport and Communications;

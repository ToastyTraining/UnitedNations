	The General Assembly,
	Recalling that the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco)1 was opened for signature at Mexico City on 14 February 1967,
	Recalling also that, in its preamble, the Treaty of Tlatelolco states that military denuclearized zones are not an end in themselves but rather a means for achieving general and complete disarmament at a later stage,
	Recalling further that, in its resolution 2286 (XXII) of 5 December 1967, it welcomed with special satisfaction the Treaty of Tlatelolco as an event of historic significance in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to promote international peace and security,
	Recalling that in 1990, 1991 and 1992 the General Conference of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean approved and opened for signature a set of amendments2 to the Treaty of Tlatelolco,1 with the aim of enabling the full entry into force of that instrument,
	Highlighting that, with the ratification of Cuba, the Treaty of Tlatelolco is now in force for thirty-three sovereign States of the region, thereby consolidating the first nuclear-weapon-free zone established in a densely populated region,
	Noting with satisfaction the interest that the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean has manifested to promote mechanisms of cooperation and consultation in other nuclear-weapon-free zones, 
	Reaffirming the importance of strengthening the Agency as the appropriate legal and political forum for ensuring cooperation with the agencies of other nuclear-weapon-free zones,
	1.	Welcomes the fact that the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco)1 is now in force for the sovereign States of the region, and that this fact was officially acknowledged by the General Conference of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean at its eighteenth session, held at Havana on 5 and 6 November 2003, and takes note of the results of the aforementioned session of the General Conference, including the adoption of the Havana Declaration;3

	3.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixtieth session the item entitled "Consolidation of the regime established by the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco)".

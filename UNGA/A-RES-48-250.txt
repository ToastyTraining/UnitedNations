	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/48/816/Add.1)]


48/250.Financing of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 690 (1991) of 29 April 1991, by which the Council established the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara, and subsequent resolutions of the Council, namely 725 (1991) of 31 December 1991, 809 (1993) of 2 March 1993 and 907 (1994) of 29 March 1994,

	Recalling its decisions 47/451 A of 22 December 1992, 47/451 B of 8 April 1993, 47/451 C of 14 September 1993 and 48/467 of 23 December 1993 on the financing of the Mission,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling its previous decision regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	2/	A/48/906.


	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara as at 24 March 1994, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 20,366,381 United States dollars;

	2.	Expresses concern about the deteriorating financial situation with regard to peace-keeping activities due to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments, particularly Member States in arrears;

	3.	Reaffirms its resolution 48/227 of 23 December 1993 and stresses the need for the Secretariat to submit budget documents in time in order to allow for a proper and thorough review and approval by the General Assembly of the budgets before their implementation;

	4.	Notes with satisfaction an improvement in the compliance by the Secretariat with certain resolutions of the General Assembly with regard to the form of budget documents concerning peace-keeping operations;

	5.	Reaffirms the importance of the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions as an advisory body to the General Assembly in the budget process;

	8.	Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Special Account for the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara promptly and in full;

	9.	Affirms that failure to pay the assessed contributions in full and on time and the fact that the General Assembly has unfortunately been led to consider and approve peace-keeping budgets without adequate documentation have damaged and continue to damage the ability of peace-keeping operations to implement their activities effectively;


	10.	Requests the Secretary-General to explore all possibilities in order to ensure prompt reimbursement to troop-contributing countries;

	11.	Takes note of the amount of 36,148,050 dollars gross (34,626,950 dollars net) expended for the maintenance of the Mission for the period from 1 December 1992 to 31 December 1993; 

	12.	Authorizes the Secretary-General to enter into commitments for the maintenance of the Mission up to the amount of 9 million dollars gross (8.4 million dollars net) for the three-month period from 1 January to
31 March 1994, the said amount to be utilized from the unencumbered balance of appropriations; 

	13.	Also authorizes the Secretary-General, pending consideration of his report on the detailed financial and administrative implications arising from Security Council resolution 907 (1994), to enter into commitments for the maintenance of the Mission at a rate not to exceed 3.7 million dollars gross per month for the period from 1 April to 10 May 1994, the said amount to be utilized from the unencumbered balance of appropriations;

	15.	Invites the Secretary-General, in the light of Security Council resolution 907 (1994), to keep under review the senior management structure of MINURSO, including a review of the modalities of employment of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its resumed forty-eighth session;

	16.	Invites voluntary contributions to the Mission in cash and in the form of services and supplies acceptable to the Secretary-General, to be administered, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedure established by the General Assembly in its resolutions 43/230 of 21 December 1988, 44/192 A of 21 December 1989 and 45/258 of 3 May 1991;

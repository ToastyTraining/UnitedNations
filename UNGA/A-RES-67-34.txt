	Reaffirming the commitment of all States parties to the Treaty on the 
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to apply the principles of irreversibility, verifiability and transparency in relation to the implementation of their treaty obligations, 
	Recalling that the 2010 Review Conference reaffirmed and recognized that the total elimination of nuclear weapons was the only absolute guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and the legitimate interest of non-nuclear-weapon States in receiving unequivocal and legally binding negative security assurances from nuclear-weapon States,
	Recognizing the continued vital importance of the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty6 to the advancement of nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation objectives, and welcoming the recent ratifications of the Treaty by Guatemala and Indonesia, the latter being listed in annex 2 to the Treaty, as well as its signature by Niue,

	Recalling the encouragement expressed at the 2010 Review Conference for the establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones, on the basis of arrangements freely arrived at among the States of the region concerned, and expressing the hope that this will be followed by concerted international efforts to create such zones in areas where they do not currently exist, especially in the Middle East,

	Deeply disappointed at the continued absence of progress towards multilateral negotiations on nuclear disarmament issues, in particular in the Conference on Disarmament, despite efforts during 2012 to agree on a programme of work, and underlining the importance of multilateralism in relation to nuclear disarmament, while recognizing the value also of bilateral and regional initiatives, 
	Welcoming the holding of the first session of the Preparatory Committee for the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in Vienna from 30 April to 11 May 2012, and emphasizing the importance of a constructive and successful preparatory process leading to the 2015 Review Conference, which should contribute to strengthening the Treaty and make progress towards achieving its full implementation and universality and the monitoring of the commitments made and actions agreed at the 1995, 2000 and 2010 Review Conference,

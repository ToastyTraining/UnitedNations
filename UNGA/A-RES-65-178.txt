	Reaffirming the goal set out in paragraph 19 of the United Nations Millennium Declaration15 to halve, by 2015, the proportion of the world's people whose income is less than one dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger,
	Welcoming the outcome of the seventeenth session of the Commission on Sustainable Development, on the thematic cluster of issues on agriculture, rural development, land, drought, desertification and Africa,16

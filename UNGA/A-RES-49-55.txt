	[on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/49/739)]


49/55.Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its twenty-seventh session


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 2205 (XXI) of 17 December 1966, by which it created the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law with a mandate to further the progressive harmonization and unification of the law of international trade and in that respect to bear in mind the interests of all peoples, in particular those of developing countries, in the extensive development of international trade,

	Reaffirming its conviction that the progressive harmonization and unification of international trade law, in reducing or removing legal obstacles to the flow of international trade, especially those affecting the developing countries, would significantly contribute to universal economic cooperation among all States on a basis of equality, equity and common interest and to the elimination of discrimination in international trade and thereby to the well-being of all peoples,

	Stressing the value of participation by States at all levels of economic development and with different legal systems in the process of harmonizing and unifying international trade law,

	Having considered the report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its twenty-seventh session, 1/

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General, 2/

	Concerned also about the fact that the need for and interest in the training and assistance programme of the Commission can only partially be met, in view of the limited human and financial resources available, and that the work of the Secretariat in the context of the Case-Law on the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Texts would substantially increase as the number of the court decisions and arbitral awards covered thereby grows,

	2.	Welcomes the ongoing work of the Commission, as described in its report, and appreciates the many proposals on possible future work made during the Congress on International Trade Law of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law, held in New York from 18 to 22 May 1992;

	3.	Reaffirms the mandate of the Commission, as the core legal body within the United Nations system in the field of international trade law, to coordinate legal activities in this field in order to avoid duplication of effort and to promote efficiency, consistency and coherence in the unification and harmonization of international trade law, and in this connection recommends that the Commission, through its secretariat, continue to maintain close cooperation with the other intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, including regional organizations, active in the field of international trade law;

	4.	Also reaffirms the importance, in particular for developing countries, of the work of the Commission concerned with training and assistance in the field of international trade law;

	5.	Expresses the desirability for the Commission to sponsor seminars and symposia to provide such training and assistance, and in this connection:

	(a)	Expresses its appreciation to the Commission for organizing seminars in Argentina, Brazil, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Pakistan and Sri Lanka,  as well as in Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, Uganda, the United Republic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe, and for assisting the Pacific Economic Cooperation Council with its initiative to promote harmonization of international trade law in the Asia-Pacific region;

	(c)	Appeals to the United Nations Development Programme and other United Nations bodies responsible for development assistance to support the training and technical assistance programme of the Commission and to cooperate and coordinate their activities with those of the Commission;

	6.	Welcomes the completion of the setting up of the Trust Fund for the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law to grant travel assistance to developing countries that are members of the Commission, at their request and in consultation with the Secretary-General, pursuant to paragraph 5 of resolution 48/32 of 9 December 1993;

	7.	Appeals to Governments, the relevant United Nations organs, organizations, institutions and individuals, in order to ensure full participation by all Member States in the sessions of the Commission and its working groups, to make voluntary contributions to the trust fund referred to in paragraph 6 above;

	8.	Decides, in order to ensure full participation by all Member States in the sessions of the Commission and its working groups, to continue its consideration in the competent Main Committee during the forty-ninth session of the General Assembly on granting travel assistance, within existing resources, to the least developed countries that are members of the Commission, at their request and in consultation with the Secretary-General;

	9.	Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that adequate resources are allocated for the effective implementation of the programmes of the Commission;

	10.	Stresses the importance of bringing into effect the conventions emanating from the work of the Commission for the global unification and harmonization of international trade law, and to this end urges States that have not yet done so to consider signing, ratifying or acceding to those conventions;

	11.	Also requests the Secretary-General to submit a report on the implementation of paragraph 8 above to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session.

	The General Assembly,
	Recalling the outcomes of all the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social, environmental and related fields, 
	Reaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development", in which it adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for the full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental - in a balanced and integrated manner, and to building upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking to address their unfinished business,
	Reaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports and complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with concrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to address the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels for sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity, 
	Welcoming the Paris Agreement1 and its early entry into force, encouraging all its parties to fully implement the Agreement, and parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change2 that have not yet done so to deposit their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, where appropriate, as soon as possible, 
	Welcoming also the New Urban Agenda, adopted at the United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development (Habitat III), held in Quito, Ecuador, from 17 to 20 October 2016,3
	Recalling its resolution 70/215 of 22 December 2015, 
	Recalling also that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognizes, inter alia, that middle-income countries still face significant challenges to achieve sustainable development and that, in order to ensure that achievements made to date are sustained, efforts to address ongoing challenges should be strengthened through the exchange of experiences, improved coordination and better and focused support of the United Nations development system, the international financial institutions, regional organizations and other stakeholders, 
	Reaffirming its resolution 71/243 of 21 December 2016 on the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system, in which it recognized that middle-income countries still face specific challenges, 
	Taking note of the outcomes of the international conferences on development cooperation with middle-income countries held over the past 10 years in Madrid,4 San Salvador,5 Windhoek6 and San José,7 and noting the regional conferences held in Cairo, in 2008, in Amman, in 2013, and in Minsk, in 2013 and 2015, 
	Emphasizing that cohesive, nationally owned sustainable development strategies, supported by integrated national financing frameworks, will be at the heart of efforts by Member States, reiterating that each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development and that the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized, highlighting the need to respect each country's policy space and leadership in the implementation of policies for poverty eradication and sustainable development while remaining consistent with relevant international rules and commitments, recognizing that national development efforts need to be supported by an enabling international economic environment, including coherent and mutually supporting world trade, monetary and financial systems and strengthened and enhanced global economic governance, and highlighting the fact that processes to develop and facilitate the availability of appropriate knowledge and technologies globally, as well as capacity-building, are also critical, including pursuing policy coherence and an enabling environment for sustainable development at all levels and by all actors and reinvigorating the global partnership for sustainable development and for the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 
	Reaffirming that the fundamental characteristics of the operational activities for development of the United Nations system should be, inter alia, their universal, voluntary and grant nature, their neutrality and their multilateralism, as well as their ability to respond to the development needs of programme countries in a flexible manner, and that the operational activities are carried out for the benefit of programme countries, at their request and in accordance with their own policies and priorities for development, 
	Recalling that the most vulnerable countries and, in particular, African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States deserve special attention, as do countries in situations of conflict and post-conflict countries, and that there are also serious challenges within many middle-income countries, 
	Recognizing that there is no "one size fits all" approach to development and that development assistance by the United Nations development system should respond to the varying development needs of programme countries, including those of middle-income countries, in a manner that addresses their specific challenges while mindful of their diversity, and should be aligned with their national development plans, strategies and circumstances in accordance with its mandates, keeping in mind the needs of the least developed countries, 
	Noting that national averages based on criteria such as per capita income do not always reflect the actual particularities and development needs of middle-income countries and that, despite notable progress in reducing poverty levels in both absolute and relative terms, poverty remains a problem in many middle-income countries as they are still home to 73 per cent of the world's people living in poverty,
	Recognizing that inequality, or even a rise in inequality, remains pervasive in middle-income countries, even in those with high levels of economic growth, that further investment in social services and economic opportunities are needed in order to reduce inequalities and that economic growth needs to be sustained, inclusive and equitable, 
	Stressing that middle-income countries continue to face particular challenges related to, inter alia, job creation, the diversification and transformation of their economies and access to international markets and, in this regard, that efforts to create a national enabling environment for development should be complemented by a global enabling environment, 
	Recognizing that connectivity through quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all, contributes to the sustainable development of middle-income countries, 
	Recalling that, for all countries, public policies and the mobilization and effective use of domestic resources, underscored by the principle of national ownership, are central to our common pursuit of sustainable development, including achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, 
	Recalling also the resolve of Member States to enhance and strengthen domestic resource mobilization and fiscal space, including, where appropriate, through modernized tax systems, more efficient tax collection, the broadening of the tax base and the effective combating of tax evasion and capital flight, and reiterating that, while each country is responsible for its tax system, it is important to support national efforts in these areas by strengthening technical assistance and enhancing international cooperation and participation in addressing international tax matters, 
	Recalling further the importance of international support, in various forms, including North-South, South-South and triangular cooperation, that is well aligned with national priorities to contribute to addressing the development needs of middle-income countries, including through capacity-building, 
	Recognizing the need to better understand the multidimensional nature of development and poverty, and acknowledging the significant role that the United Nations system has played and should continue to play in this regard, 
	Expressing concern that climate change is adversely affecting productivity in every country, in particular developing countries, including middle-income countries, as extreme weather shocks directly affect productivity through the destruction of infrastructure and labour force displacement, and that a number of middle-income countries have sizeable sectors that are exposed to climate change, such as agriculture, construction, mining, tourism and transport, 
	Reaffirming that achieving gender equality, empowering all women and girls, and the full realization of their human rights are essential to achieving sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development, and in that regard reiterating the need for gender mainstreaming, including targeted actions and investments in the formulation and implementation of all financial, economic, environmental and social policies,
	Noting with concern that the ratio of public debt to gross domestic product for middle-income countries increased from around 48 per cent in 2015 to 50 per cent in 2016,
	Recognizing that the remaining effects of the world financial and economic crisis have the potential to undermine progress towards achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, and threaten debt sustainability in many countries, especially developing countries, 
	Reiterating the pledge that no one will be left behind, reaffirming the recognition that the dignity of the human person is fundamental, and the wish to see the Goals and targets met for all nations and peoples and for all segments of society, and recommitting to endeavour to reach the furthest behind first,
	Recommitting to ensuring that no country or person is left behind and to focusing our effort where the challenges are greatest, including by ensuring the inclusion and participation of those who are furthest behind,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;8

	6.	Welcomes the solidarity of middle-income countries with other developing countries, in particular the financial, technical, technology transfer and capacity-building support being provided by middle-income countries, particularly to the least developed countries, through South-South and triangular cooperation, while stressing that South-South cooperation is a complement to, and not a substitute for, North-South cooperation, and in this regard calls upon the United Nations development system to continue its ongoing efforts to mainstream support to South-South cooperation and triangular cooperation;

Calls upon the United Nations development system, in line with its resolution 71/243, to continue to support developing countries in their efforts to achieve the internationally agreed development goals and their development objectives, and requests the development system to address, within existing resources and mandates, the special challenges facing the most vulnerable countries, as well as the specific challenges facing middle-income countries, in line with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development9 and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,10 and in this regard requests the Secretary-General to present, as part of his report on the implementation of the present resolution, an assessment of the outcomes of existing strategies within the United Nations development system related to middle-income countries; 
	10.

	16.	Notes with concern that access to concessional finance is reduced as countries' incomes grow and that countries may not be able to access sufficient affordable financing from other sources to meet their needs, encourages shareholders in multilateral development banks to develop graduation policies that are sequenced, phased and gradual, and encourages multilateral development banks to explore ways to ensure that their assistance best addresses the opportunities and challenges presented by the diverse circumstances of middle-income countries;

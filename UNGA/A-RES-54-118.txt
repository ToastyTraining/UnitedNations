    The General Assembly,

    Considering the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, particularly resolution 637 (1989) of 27 July 1989, and its own resolutions, particularly resolution 43/24 of 15 November 1988, in which it requests the Secretary-General to continue his good offices and to afford the fullest possible support to the Central American Governments in their efforts to achieve the objectives of peace, reconciliation, democracy, development and justice established in the agreement on "Procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central America" of 7 August 1987,1


    Reaffirming its resolutions in which it recognizes and stresses the importance of international economic, financial and technical cooperation and assistance, both bilateral and multilateral, aimed at promoting economic and social development in the region with a view to furthering and supplementing the efforts of the Central American peoples and Governments to achieve peace and democratization, particularly resolution 52/169 G of 16 December 1997, concerning international assistance to and cooperation with the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America,2 as well as its resolution 53/1 C of 2 November 1998, concerning emergency assistance to Central America, owing to the destruction caused by hurricane Mitch,

    Emphasizing the importance of the development of the Central American Integration System, which has as its main objective the promotion of the integration process; the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America as the integrated programme for national and regional development, which contains the commitments and priorities of the countries of the area for the promotion of sustainable development; the establishment of the subsystem and of the regional social policy; the model of democratic Central American security; and the implementation of other agreements adopted at the presidential summit meetings, which taken together constitute the global frame of reference for consolidating peace, freedom, democracy and development and the basis for the promotion of mutually advantageous relations between Central America and the international community,

    Recognizing the progress made in the fulfilment of the commitments contained in the Guatemala Peace Agreements, implementation of which is being verified by the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala, including the submission of the report of the Commission for Historical Clarification,3 the finalization of the programme for the repatriation of the Guatemalan refugees in Mexico, the compliance with the expenditure ceilings contained in the Agreements, the expansion of the deployment of the new National Civil Police, the approval by the Congress of the new Land Act and the establishment of the Office for the Defence of Indigenous Women,

    Taking note with satisfaction of the successful implementation of the Peace Agreements and of the consolidation of the process of democratization in El Salvador, as a result of the efforts of the country's people and Government,

    Recognizing with satisfaction the role played by the peacekeeping operations and observer and monitoring missions of the United Nations, which carried out successfully their mandate in Central America pursuant to the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, respectively,

    Welcoming the changes and progress made by the Central American peoples, whose efforts have brought about, inter alia, the strengthening of civil society and authority, the creation of new political forms, the holding of free and pluralistic elections, the creation of mechanisms for the protection and promotion of human rights, freedom of expression, the strengthening of democratic institutions and of the rule of law, judicial reform processes and the adoption of a fairer development model providing greater opportunities for the Central American peoples,

    Emphasizing the importance of the end of a critical period in Central American history and the start of a new phase free from armed conflict, with freely elected Governments in each country and with political, economic, social and other changes which can create a climate conducive to the promotion of economic growth and further progress towards the consolidation and further development of democratic, just and equitable societies,
    
    Reaffirming that firm and lasting peace and democracy in Central America are a dynamic and ongoing process that faces serious structural challenges, whose continuation and consolidation are closely related to progress in human development, especially the alleviation of extreme poverty, the promotion of economic and social justice, judicial reform, the safeguarding of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for minorities and the satisfaction of the basic needs of the most vulnerable groups among the peoples of the region, issues which have been a primary source of tension and conflict and which deserve to be discussed with the same urgency and dedication as was the case in the settlement of armed conflicts,

    10.	Reiterates its deep appreciation to the Secretary-General, his special representatives, the groups of countries for the peace processes in El Salvador (Colombia, Mexico, Spain, United States of America and Venezuela), and Guatemala (Colombia, Mexico, Norway, Spain, United States of America and Venezuela), to the Support Group for Nicaragua (Canada, Mexico, Netherlands, Spain and Sweden), to the European Union and to other countries that have contributed significantly and to the international community in general for its support and solidarity in the building of peace, democracy and development in Central America;

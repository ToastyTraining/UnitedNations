	Deeply concerned by the growing number of complex humanitarian emergencies in the past few years, in particular in armed conflicts and in post-conflict situations, which have dramatically increased the loss of human lives, in particular of civilians, the suffering of victims, flows of refugees and internally displaced persons, as well as material destruction, which disrupt the development efforts of the countries affected, in particular those of developing countries,

	Recalling the inclusion of attacks intentionally directed against personnel involved in a humanitarian assistance or peacekeeping mission in accordance with the Charter as a war crime in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, adopted on 17 July 1998,12 and noting the role that the Court could play in appropriate cases in bringing to justice those responsible for serious violations of international humanitarian law,
	Noting that the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel, which entered into force on 15 January 1999,13 has been ratified by fifty-five Member States as at the present date,

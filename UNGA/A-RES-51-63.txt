	7.	Reaffirms the high priority attached to technical cooperation and advisory services in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice, and stresses the need to continue to improve the operational activities of the Programme, in particular in developing countries and countries in transition, in order to meet the needs of Member States, at their request, for support in crime prevention and criminal justice;

	8.	Calls upon States and United Nations funding agencies to make significant financial contributions for operational activities of the Programme, and encourages all States to make voluntary contributions for that purpose to the United Nations Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice Fund, also taking into account the activities required for the implementation of the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan against Organized Transnational Crime;

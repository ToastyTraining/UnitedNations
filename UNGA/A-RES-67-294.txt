	10.	Expresses deep concern about the ongoing adverse impacts of the global financial and economic crisis, excessively volatile energy and food prices and ongoing concerns over food security and nutrition, as well as the increasing challenges posed by climate change, drought, land degradation, desertification, the loss of biodiversity and floods, and the serious challenges these impacts pose to the fight against poverty and hunger, which could pose serious additional challenges to the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, particularly in Africa;
	11.	Expresses grave concern that Africa is among the hardest hit by the impact of the world financial and economic crisis, recognizes that, while global growth is returning, there is a need to sustain the recovery, which is fragile and uneven, and therefore reaffirms the need to continue to support the special needs of Africa and take action to mitigate the multidimensional impacts of the crisis on the continent;

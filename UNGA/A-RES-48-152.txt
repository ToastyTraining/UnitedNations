Afghanistan, with a view to formulating proposals that could contribute to ensuring full protection of the human rights of the inhabitants of the country before, during and after the withdrawal of all foreign forces,

	Recalling also its resolution 47/141 of 18 December 1992 and all its other relevant resolutions, as well as the resolutions of the Commission on Human Rights and the decisions of the Economic and Social Council,

	Taking note, in particular, of Commission on Human Rights resolution 1993/66 of 10 March 1993, 5/ in which the Commission decided to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan for one year and to request him to report to the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session, and of Economic and Social Council decision 1993/275 of 28 July 1993, in which the Council approved the Commission's decision,

	Noting that, following the demise of the former Afghan Government, a transitional Islamic State of Afghanistan was established, 6/

	Noting with deep concern that in spite of the efforts and initiatives taken by the Government of Afghanistan towards ensuring complete peace and stability, a situation of armed confrontation, affecting mainly the civilian population, which is still the target of indiscriminate military attacks by rival groups, continues to exist in parts of the territory of Afghanistan, and in particular in Kabul, and has also caused a dramatic rise in the number of persons displaced inside the country,

	Concerned that the prevailing situation in the country as regards the political and legal order is affecting the security of members of all ethnic and religious groups, including minorities,

	Noting that much remains to be done for the treatment of prisoners to be in conformity with the provisions of the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 1949 and the Additional Protocols thereto, of 1977,

	Deeply concerned that the repatriation of Afghan refugees has dramatically declined in 1993, owing to the prevailing situation in Afghanistan, and expressing the hope that conditions in the country will allow those still in exile to return as soon as possible,

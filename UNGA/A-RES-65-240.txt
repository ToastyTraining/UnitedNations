65/240.	Global efforts for the total elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and the comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 52/111 of 12 December 1997, in which it decided to convene the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, and its resolutions 56/266 of 27 March 2002, 57/195 of 18 December 2002, 58/160 of 22 December 2003, 59/177 of 20 December 2004 and 60/144 of 16 December 2005, which guided the comprehensive follow-up to and effective implementation of the World Conference, and in this regard underlining the importance of their full and effective implementation,
	Recalling also its resolution 64/148 of 18 December 2009, in which it, inter alia, called for the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance,1 which represents an important opportunity for the international community to reaffirm its commitment to the eradication of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, including by mobilizing political will at the national, regional and international levels, with a view to achieving concrete results,
	Taking note of Human Rights Council decision 3/103 of 8 December 2006,2 by which, heeding the decision and instruction of the World Conference, the Council established the Ad Hoc Committee of the Human Rights Council on the Elaboration of Complementary Standards, and encouraging the Committee to continue making progress in the discharge of its mandate,
	Bearing in mind the responsibility and obligations of the Human Rights Council emanating from the outcome of the Durban Review Conference,3 
	Reiterating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and well-being of their societies, and that any doctrine of racial superiority is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and must be rejected, together with theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human races,
	Convinced that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance manifest themselves in a differentiated manner for women and girls and may be among the factors leading to a deterioration in their living conditions, poverty, violence, multiple forms of discrimination and the limitation or denial of their human rights, and recognizing the need to integrate a gender perspective into relevant policies, strategies and programmes of action against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in order to address multiple forms of discrimination,
	Underlining the primacy of political will, international cooperation and adequate funding at the national, regional and international levels needed to address all forms and manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,
	Alarmed at the increase in racist violence and xenophobic ideas in many parts of the world, in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large as a result, inter alia, of the resurgent activities of associations established on the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters, and the persistent use of those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies,
	Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating continuing and violent trends involving racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy, tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication,
	Acknowledging the centrality of resource mobilization, effective global partnership and international cooperation in the context of paragraphs 157 and 158 of the Durban Programme of Action for the successful realization of commitments undertaken at the World Conference,
	Expressing grave concern at the lack of progress made in the implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action, in particular key paragraphs 157 to 159 of the Programme of Action,
	Welcoming the continued commitment of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to profiling and increasing the visibility of the struggle against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and recognizing the need for the High Commissioner to make this a cross-cutting issue in the activities and programmes of her Office,
	Welcoming also the work of the Intergovernmental Working Group on the Effective Implementation of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action at its seventh and eighth sessions, held from 5 to 16 October 20094 and from 11 to 22 October 2010,5 respectively, in particular the recommendation on the commemoration of the tenth anniversary of the adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action,6 and looking forward to the consideration by the Human Rights Council of the conclusions and recommendations of the Working Group,
	Recognizing the potential of sport as a universal language contributing to the education of people on the values of diversity, tolerance and fairness and as a means to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,
	Welcoming the hosting of the 2010 and 2014 International Federation of Association Football World Cups in South Africa and Brazil, respectively, and stressing the importance of making continuing use of those events to promote understanding, tolerance and peace and to promote and strengthen efforts in the fight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,

	The General Assembly
	Adopts the following declaration:


Declaration on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations


	1.	We solemnly reaffirm our faith in the United Nations and our unfailing commitment to the purposes and principles of the Charter, as well as to the Charter in its entirety.
	2.	We firmly believe that the Charter enshrines our common values as human beings, which unite us in diversity beyond our differences of language, culture or religion, today as 70 years ago.
	3.	We pay tribute to the founders of the United Nations and to the dedicated men and women who have contributed their work, and sometimes their life, to the ideals of the United Nations, and we acknowledge the crucial role that the Organization has played in the past seven decades in the fields of peace and security, human rights and social and economic development.
	4.	We wish to renew the determination set forth in the Preamble to the Charter "to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind" by recommitting to our obligation to refrain in our international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State, or in any other manner inconsistent with the purposes of the United Nations.
	5.	We recommit ourselves to fulfilling in good faith the obligations assumed by us in accordance with the Charter and to the principle of the sovereign equality of all States, respect for their territorial integrity and political independence, the right to self-determination of peoples, the non-intervention in the internal affairs of States and the resolution of international disputes by peaceful means and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law.
	6.	We reaffirm our faith in the inherent dignity of the human person and in the equal rights of women and men, as well as our commitment to promoting, protecting and ensuring all human rights for all without distinction of any kind, and recognize those rights as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace. We are determined to renew our endeavours to cooperate in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural or humanitarian character.
	7.	We recognize the important role played by the United Nations in the promotion of economic and social development in the past decades. In this regard, we recognize that eradicating poverty, in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development. We are resolved to further the pursuit of global development and win-win cooperation through our full support to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.1
	8.	We solemnly pledge to continue to cooperate with a strong, legitimate and credible United Nations. We bear in mind the ongoing process of United Nations reforms in all their aspects. We are confident that, with the responsibility and generosity of its members, the United Nations will be able to respond swiftly and efficiently to the challenges of tomorrow.

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 15 December 2004
[without reference to a Main Committee (A/59/L.46 and Add.1)]
		59/144.	The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the link between the illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts


	The General Assembly,
	Recognizing that the trade in conflict diamonds is a matter of serious international concern, which can be directly linked to the fuelling of armed conflict, the activities of rebel movements aimed at undermining or overthrowing legitimate Governments and the illicit traffic in and proliferation of armaments, especially small arms and light weapons, 
	Recognizing also the devastating impact of conflicts fuelled by the trade in conflict diamonds on the peace, safety and security of people in affected countries, and the systematic and gross human rights violations that have been perpetrated in such conflicts,
	Noting the negative impact of such conflicts on regional stability and the obligations placed upon States by the Charter of the United Nations regarding the maintenance of international peace and security,
	Recognizing, therefore, that continued action to curb the trade in conflict diamonds is imperative, 
	Recognizing also the positive benefits of the legitimate diamond trade to producing countries, and underlining the need for continued international action to prevent the problem of conflict diamonds from negatively affecting the trade in legitimate diamonds, which makes a critical contribution to the economies of many of the producing, exporting and importing States, especially developing States,
	Noting that the vast majority of rough diamonds produced in the world are from legitimate sources,
	Recalling the Charter and all the relevant resolutions of the Security Council related to conflict diamonds, and determined to contribute to and support the implementation of the measures provided for in those resolutions,
	Recalling also Security Council resolution 1459 (2003) of 28 January 2003, in which the Council strongly supported the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme1 as a valuable contribution against trafficking in conflict diamonds,
	Welcoming the important contribution of the Kimberley Process, which was initiated by African diamond-producing countries,
	Believing that the implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme should substantially reduce the opportunity for conflict diamonds to play a role in fuelling armed conflict and should help to protect legitimate trade and ensure the effective implementation of the relevant resolutions on trade in conflict diamonds,
	Recalling its resolutions 55/56 of 1 December 2000, 56/263 of 13 March 2002, 57/302 of 15 April 2003 and 58/290 of 14 April 2004, in which it called for the development and implementation of proposals for a simple, effective and pragmatic international certification scheme for rough diamonds,
	Welcoming, in this regard, the implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme in such a way that it does not impede the legitimate trade in diamonds or impose an undue burden on Governments or industry, particularly smaller producers, and does not hinder the development of the diamond industry,
	Welcoming also the decision of countries and one regional economic integration organization to address the problem of conflict diamonds by participating in the Kimberley Process and to implement the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme,
	Welcoming further the important contribution made by the diamond industry, in particular the World Diamond Council, as well as civil society, to assist international efforts to stop the trade in conflict diamonds,
	Welcoming the voluntary self-regulation initiatives for the diamond industry announced by the World Diamond Council, and recognizing that a system of such voluntary self-regulation will contribute, as described in the Interlaken Declaration of 5 November 2002 on the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for Rough Diamonds,2 to ensuring the effectiveness of national systems of internal control for rough diamonds,
	Noting with appreciation that the Kimberley Process has pursued its deliberations on an inclusive basis, involving concerned stakeholders, including producing, exporting and importing States, the diamond industry and civil society,
	Recognizing that State sovereignty should be fully respected and that the principles of equality, mutual benefits and consensus should be adhered to,
	Recognizing also that the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which came into effect on 1 January 2003, will be credible only if all participants have established internal systems of control designed to eliminate the presence of conflict diamonds in the chain of producing, exporting and importing rough diamonds within their own territories, while taking into account that differences in production methods and trading practices, as well as differences in institutional controls thereof, may require different approaches to meet minimum standards,
	1.	Reaffirms its strong and continuing support for the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme;1
	2.	Recognizes that the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme can help to ensure the effective implementation of relevant resolutions of the Security Council containing sanctions on the trade in conflict diamonds, and calls for the full implementation of existing Council measures targeting the illicit trade in rough diamonds that play a role in fuelling conflict;
	3.	Also recognizes the important contributions that the international efforts to address the problem of conflict diamonds, including the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, have made to the settlement of conflicts in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and the ongoing value of the Certification Scheme as a mechanism for the prevention of future conflicts;
	4.	Stresses that the widest possible participation in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme is essential and should be encouraged, and urges all Member States to participate actively in the Certification Scheme by complying with its undertakings;
	5.	Notes with appreciation the report of the Chair of the Kimberley Process submitted pursuant to resolution 58/290,3 and congratulates the Governments, regional economic integration organization representatives, the organized diamond industry and civil society participating in the Kimberley Process for contributing to the development and implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme;
	6.	Takes note of the decision of the General Council of the World Trade Organization of 15 May 2003 granting a waiver with respect to the measures taken to implement the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, effective from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2006;4
	7.	Welcomes the progress achieved at the plenary meeting of the Kimberley Process held in Gatineau, Canada, from 27 to 29 October 2004, expanding the mandate of the Participation Committee to advise the Chair on matters of non-compliance by participants;
	8.	Also welcomes the important progress made towards the implementation of the peer review mechanism, including the submission of annual reports by all participants and the completion of eleven voluntary review visits, and encourages all remaining participants to receive voluntary review visits;
	9.	Encourages all participants in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme to collate and submit relevant statistical data on the production of and international trade in rough diamonds as a tool for effective implementation and as envisaged by the Certification Scheme;
	10.	Acknowledges with great appreciation the important contribution that Canada, as Chair of the Kimberley Process in 2004, has made to the efforts to curb the trade in conflict diamonds, and welcomes the succession of the Russian Federation as Chair and Botswana as Vice-Chair of the Process for 2005;
	11.	Requests the Chair of the Kimberley Process to submit a report on the implementation of the Process to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session;
	12.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixtieth session the item entitled "The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict".

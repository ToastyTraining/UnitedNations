	Noting with appreciation the comments and observations contained in paragraph 6 of the report of the Advisory Committee,2 concerning the Panel on United Nations Peace Operations and the determination of resources, and in paragraph 26, concerning the role and responsibilities of the head of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations of the Secretariat and his senior staff in the area of management,
	1.	Attaches great importance to the provision of adequate resources for peacekeeping operations and their backstopping as well as for all priority activities of the Organization, in particular activities in the area of development, and underlines the need for genuine and meaningful partnership between the Security Council, the troop-contributing Governments and other Member States and the Secretariat;
	2.	Reaffirms that the expenses of the Organization, including the backstopping of peacekeeping operations, shall be borne by Member States;
	3.	Requests the Secretary-General, when making first-time use of the results-based budgeting technique in the presentation of the support account budget estimates for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2002 to 30 June 2003, to undertake a complete rethinking of how post and non-post resources for the support account are justified and presented and, in this regard, to take full account of paragraphs 9 and 10 of the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;2
	4.	Reaffirms the decision in paragraph 2 of its resolution 49/250 that the support account funds shall be used for the sole purpose of financing human and non-human resource requirements for backstopping and supporting peacekeeping operations at Headquarters, and that any changes to this limitation will require the prior approval of the General Assembly;
	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to review the issue of capacity in the Peacekeeping Best Practices Unit for policy support in peacekeeping operations in the area of demobilization, disarmament and reintegration, taking into account the views of the Advisory Committee;
	6.	Stresses that the creation of small units in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to fulfil various functions which duplicate the responsibilities of other departments must be avoided, and shares the caution expressed by the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions that an increase in the number of organizational units in the Department does not necessarily facilitate coordination or enhance administrative and management capacity;
	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to prevent duplication of work between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Department of Political Affairs of the Secretariat and to further clarify the relationships and interactions between the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and other offices in the Department of Management of the Secretariat, especially those dealing with personnel, financial administration and control, management of procurement activities and monitoring of delegated authority;
	8.	Also requests the Secretary-General to report, in the context of the annual support account budget estimates, on action taken by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations to develop and implement a comprehensive information technology systems strategy that integrates field missions with the Secretariat's overall information and communication technology strategy;
	9.	Expresses concern about the effect of scattering the units of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations in a number of different physical locations on its operational effectiveness, and requests the Secretary-General to investigate and report on ways and means of achieving co-location of such units;
	10.	Also expresses concern over the delay in the recruitment and staffing of the 93 support account posts approved in December 2000 on an urgent basis;
	11.	Reaffirms section I, paragraph 6, of its resolution 55/238, in which it agreed with paragraph 36 of the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations4 relating to proper representation of troop-contributing countries in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations;
	12.	Expresses concern over the imbalance in the geographical representation of Member States in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, and urges the Secretary-General to take immediate measures to improve the representation of under-represented and unrepresented Member States in future recruitment;
	13.	Also expresses concern over the lack of compliance by the Department of Peacekeeping Operations with the rules, regulations and procedures pertaining to human resources management, and in this regard reaffirms the role of the Office of Human Resources Management of the Secretariat as set out in General Assembly resolutions 53/221 of 7 April 1999 and 55/258 of 14 June 2001, in particular the General Assembly decision that the Office of Human Resources Management should remain the central authority for the monitoring and approval of the recruitment and placement of staff and for the interpretation of the regulations and rules of the Organization and their enforcement;
	14.	Welcomes the emphasis on training, planning and establishment of rosters, which would provide the capacity to manage and monitor personnel actions in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the Office of Human Resources Management, and encourages the utilization of information technology in reducing the current recruitment period below 180 days;
	15.	Regrets the inordinate delay in the certification of write-off claims from some liquidated peacekeeping operations, and requests the Secretary-General to finalize the certification of those claims by 30 June 2002 and to submit a progress report on this issue to the General Assembly at its resumed fifty-sixth session;
	16.	Urges the Secretary-General to give priority to the reimbursement of claims from liquidated missions, including maintaining adequate reserves to settle claims once certified;
	17.	Endorses the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee,2 subject to the provisions of the present resolution, and decides not to establish at this time the D-2 post of Director of Change Management mentioned in paragraph 28 of the report of the Advisory Committee and to keep the matter under review for consideration at the second part of its resumed fifty-sixth session, and, in the light of the development of a coherent policy, to review the P-5 post for gender issues at the second part of its resumed fifty-sixth session;
	18.	Requests the Secretary-General to entrust the Office of Internal Oversight Services of the Secretariat with the task of conducting an evaluation of the impact of the recent restructuring of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations on its backstopping of peacekeeping operations performance, and the impact on efficient and effective use of the resources of the Department, and to report to the General Assembly at its resumed fifty-sixth session;
	19.	Decides to appropriate an additional amount of 1,575,700 United States dollars under the following sections of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 
2002-2003: 376,400 dollars under section 3, Political affairs; 888,800 dollars under section 22, Human rights; 127,900 dollars under section 27, Management and central support services; and 182,600 dollars under section 32, Staff assessment, to be offset by a corresponding amount (182,600 dollars) under income section 1, Income from staff assessment, of the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2002-2003;
	20.	Approves an additional 121 support account-funded posts and their related post and non-post requirements in the amount of 16,103,750 dollars gross (14,889,500 dollars net) for the period from 1 July 2001 to 30 June 2002;
	21.	Requests the Secretary-General to conduct, through the Office of Internal Oversight Services, an audit of the policies and procedures of the Organization for recruiting staff for the Department of Peacekeeping Operations and to report thereon to the General Assembly for its consideration at its resumed fifty-sixth session.

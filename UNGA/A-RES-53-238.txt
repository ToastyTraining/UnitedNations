	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/53/989)]


53/238.	Financing of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic


    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

    Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 1159 (1998) of 27 March 1998, by which the Council decided to establish the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Mission, the latest of which was resolution 1230 (1999) of 26 February 1999,

    Recalling its resolution 52/249 of 26 June 1998 on the financing of the Mission,

    Reaffirming that the costs of the Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,


    Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Mission,

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

    1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic as at 30 April 1999, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 15.9 million United States dollars, representing 34 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Mission to the period ending 30 November 1998, notes that some 26 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

    2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

    3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

    4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Mission in full and on time;

    5.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions; 2

    6.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

    7.	Also requests the Secretary-General, in order to reduce the cost of employing General Service staff, to continue efforts to recruit local staff for the Mission against General Service posts, commensurate with the requirements of the Mission;


    8.	Approves, on an exceptional basis, the special arrangements for the Mission with regard to the application of article IV of the financial regulations of the United Nations, whereby appropriations required in respect of obligations owed to Governments providing contingents and/or logistic support for the Mission shall be retained beyond the period stipulated under financial regulations 4.3 and 4.4, as set out in the annex to the present resolution;

    9.	Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic the amount of 34,309,800 dollars gross (33,860,700 dollars net) for the operation of the Mission in respect of  the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, in addition to the amount of 29,105,850 dollars gross (28,369,350 dollars net) already appropriated under the terms of General Assembly resolution 52/249 and inclusive of the amount of 18,111,200 dollars gross (17,728,700 dollars net) authorized by the Advisory Committee under the terms of section IV of Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994;

    10.	Decides also, as an ad hoc arrangement, taking into account the amount of 29,105,850 gross (28,369,350 dollars net) already apportioned under the terms of General Assembly resolution 52/249, to apportion among Member States the additional amount of 34,309,800 dollars gross (33,860,700 dollars net) for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of its resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996, 51/218 A to C of 18 December 1996 and 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and 50/451 B of 23 December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the years 1998 and 1999, as set out in its resolution 52/215 A of 22 December 1997;

    Taking into account the fact that the parties have expressed their interest in the continued presence of the Mission in Guatemala,

Notes that, while significant achievements have been registered in the implementation of the Comprehensive Agreement on Human Rights,5 important shortcomings persist, and calls upon the Government to redouble its efforts in the promotion of human rights, taking into account the recommendations contained in the reports on human rights of the Mission, and to do its utmost to assist in the investigation of the murder of Monsignor Juan José Gerardi Conedera;

    9.

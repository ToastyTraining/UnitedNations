	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Second Committee (A/50/617/Add.9)]


50/107.Observance of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty and proclamation of the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty


	The General Assembly,

	Reaffirming its resolutions 43/195 of 20 December 1988, 44/212 of 22 December 1989, 45/213 of 21 December 1990, 46/141 of 17 December 1991, 47/197 of 22 December 1992, 48/184 of 21 December 1993 and 49/110 of 19 December 1994, all related to international cooperation for the eradication of poverty in developing countries,

	Recalling its resolution 48/183 of 21 December 1993, in which it proclaimed 1996 International Year for the Eradication of Poverty,

	Recalling also its resolution 49/110, in which it requested that a draft programme on the preparations for and observance of the Year be elaborated at an early date,

	Emphasizing the necessity for Governments to focus their efforts and policies on addressing the root causes of poverty and providing for the basic needs of all,

	Recognizing that the eradication of poverty requires ensuring universal access to economic opportunities that will promote sustainable livelihood and making basic efforts to facilitate access to opportunities and services for the disadvantaged, and that people living in poverty and vulnerable groups must be empowered through organization and social life, in particular in the planning and implementation of policies that affect them, thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development,


	Also recognizing that economic development, social development and environmental protection are interdependent and mutually reinforcing components of sustainable development, which is the framework for efforts to achieve a higher quality of life for all people, and that equitable social development, which empowers people living in poverty to utilize environmental resources sustainably, is a necessary foundation for sustainable development,

	Stressing the necessity to promote and implement policies to create a supportive external economic environment, through, inter alia, cooperation in the formulation and implementation of macroeconomic policies, trade liberalization, mobilization and/or the provision of new and additional financial resources that are both adequate and predictable and mobilized in a way that maximizes the availability of such resources for sustainable development, using all available funding sources and mechanisms, enhanced financial stability and ensuring increased access of developing countries to global markets, productive investments and technologies, and appropriate knowledge,

	Also stressing that the United Nations system should play a central role in enhancing support and assistance for developing countries, in particular African countries and least developed countries, in their efforts to achieve the objectives set forth in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and in the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development, 1/ as well as in the major United Nations conferences organized since 1990 towards the eradication of poverty,

	Emphasizing that empowering women will be a critical factor in the eradication of poverty, since women constitute a majority of people living in poverty and since they contribute to the economy and to combating poverty through both their remunerated and their unremunerated work at home, in the community and in the workplace,

	Considering that the international community at the highest political level has already reached a consensus and committed itself to the eradication of poverty in recent major United Nations conferences, including the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, the International Conference on Population and Development, the Fourth World Conference on Women and in particular the World Summit for Social Development, which addressed the eradication of poverty as one of its three major themes, as well as the expected contributions from the forthcoming United Nations Conference on Human Settlements (Habitat II), the ninth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the World Food Summit,

	Noting the importance attached at the summit meeting of seven major industrialized countries, held at Halifax, Canada, from 15 to 17 June 1995, in considering measures towards the eradication of poverty, 2/

	Bearing in mind that Governments decided to adopt the appropriate measures and mechanisms for implementing and monitoring the outcome of the World Summit for Social Development, with the assistance, upon request, of the specialized agencies, programmes, funds and regional commissions of the United Nations system, with broad participation of all sectors of civil society,

	Recalling the Copenhagen Declaration and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development, in particular paragraph 95 (c) of the Programme of Action, in which it is recommended that the General Assembly, at its fiftieth session, declare the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty, following the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty (1996), with a view to considering further initiatives on the eradication of poverty,

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the draft programme for the observance of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty 3/ and on international cooperation for the eradication of poverty in developing countries, 4/ 

	Taking note of the Secretary-General's proposal in response to resolution 49/110, that the theme of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty be "Poverty can be and must be eradicated throughout the world",

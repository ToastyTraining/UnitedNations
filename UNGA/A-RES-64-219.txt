	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 2211 (XXI) of 17 December 1966, in response to which a trust fund, subsequently renamed the United Nations Population Fund, was established in 1967 by the Secretary-General,
	Recalling also its resolution 3019 (XXVII) of 18 December 1972, in which it placed the United Nations Population Fund under its authority as a subsidiary organ, in accordance with Article 22 of the Charter of the United Nations, taking into account the separate identity of the Fund,

	2.	Decides that the secretariat of the United Nations Population Fund shall continue to be headed by an Executive Director at the Under-Secretary-General level;
	3.	Also decides that the Executive Director of the United Nations Population Fund shall be appointed by the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme/United Nations Population Fund, for a term of four years.

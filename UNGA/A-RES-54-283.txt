Agenda item 176


	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[without reference to a Main Committee (A/54/L.88/Rev.1 and Add.1)]


54/283.	Review of the problem of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in all its aspects

    The General Assembly,

    Recalling its resolution 44/233 of 22 December 1989, Economic and Social Council resolution 1999/36 of 28 July 1999 and other relevant resolutions,

    Noting with deep concern the accelerating spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which has already infected millions of people worldwide, and the resulting increase in cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS),

    Recognizing that no country in the world has been spared by the AIDS epidemic and that 90 per cent of the people living with HIV/AIDS live in the developing world, which has been very severely affected, particularly in Africa,

    Mindful that the AIDS epidemic has become a development crisis in many countries, with devastating consequences for human, social and economic progress, and that the development gains of the past fifty years, including the increase in child survival and in life expectancy, are being reversed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic,

    Alarmed that, despite all efforts, the HIV/AIDS epidemic is having a more severe impact than was originally projected, and recognizing that resources devoted to combating the epidemic at both national and international levels are not commensurate with the magnitude of the problem,

    Commending the efforts by the Joint United Nations Programme on Human Immunodeficiency Virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome to coordinate and intensify efforts to address HIV/AIDS in all appropriate forums,
    
    Recognizing  that the needs in countries addressing AIDS far outweigh both the human and the financial resources being made available and that high-level political commitment is critical to strengthen the response to the epidemic,

    1.	Decides to convene a special session of the General Assembly for a duration of three days to review and address the problem of HIV/AIDS in all its aspects and to coordinate and intensify international efforts to combat it, as soon as possible, preferably in May 2001 but not later than the end of its fifty-sixth session;

    2.	Urges Member States and observers to ensure their representation at the special session at a high political level;

    3.	Decides that the exact date of the special session, as well as the modalities, participation in and organization of the preparatory process and the special session, should be finalized, at the earliest opportunity, at its fifty-fifth session;

    4.	Also decides to include in the agenda of its fifty-fifth session the item entitled "Review of the problem of human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome in all its aspects".

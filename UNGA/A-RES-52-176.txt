52/176.The situation in Central America: procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace and progress in fashioning a region of peace, freedom, democracy and development


	The General Assembly,

	Considering the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, particularly resolution 637 (1989) of 27 July 1989, and its own resolutions, particularly resolution 43/24 of 15 November 1988, in which it requests the Secretary-General to continue his good offices and to afford the fullest possible support to the Central American Governments in their efforts to achieve the objectives of peace, reconciliation, democracy, development and justice established in the agreement on "Procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central America" of 7 August 1987,1

	Reaffirming its resolutions in which it recognizes and stresses the importance of international economic, financial and technical cooperation and assistance, both bilateral and multilateral, aimed at promoting economic and social development in the region with a view to furthering and supplementing the efforts of the Central American peoples and Governments to achieve peace and democratization, particularly resolution 50/58 B of 12 December 1995, concerning international assistance to and cooperation with the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America,2

	Emphasizing the importance of the establishment of the Central American Integration System as the institutional framework having as its main objective to promote a comprehensive integration process, the adoption of the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America, which constitutes the new integrated programme for national and regional development containing the commitments and priorities of the countries of the area for the promotion of political, economic, social, cultural and environmental progress, the establishment of the subsystem and of the regional social policy, the new model of democratic Central American security and the implementation of other agreements adopted at the presidential summit meetings, which taken together constitute the global frame of reference for maintaining and consolidating the peace process and the basis for a mutually advantageous redefinition of relations between Central America and the international community,


	Welcoming the Agreement on a Firm and Lasting Peace signed by the Government of Guatemala and the Unidad Revolucionaria Nacional Guatemalteca on 29 December 1996,3 whereby all the agreements signed within the context of the peace process and under the auspices of the United Nations came into force, thereby putting an end to the last and most long-standing armed confrontation in the region,

	Recognizing the progress made in the fulfilment of the commitments contained in the Guatemala Peace Agreements, implementation of which is being verified by the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala, including those relating to the demobilization and reintegration of former combatants into civilian life, the treatment of returnees, the establishment of special commissions, the promotion and protection of human rights and progress with respect to constitutional reforms,

	Recognizing with satisfaction the role played by the peacekeeping operations and observer and monitoring missions of the United Nations, which carried out successfully their mandate in Central America pursuant to the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, respectively,

	Welcoming the changes and progress made by the peoples of Central America, whose efforts have brought about, inter alia, constitutional reforms, the strengthening and demilitarization of civil society, the creation of new political forms, the holding of free and pluralistic elections, the creation of mechanisms for the protection and promotion of human rights, freedom of expression, the strengthening of democratic institutions and of the rule of law, the execution of judicial reform processes and the adoption of a fairer development model providing greater opportunities for the Central American peoples,

	Emphasizing the importance of the end of a critical period in Central American history and the start of a new phase free from armed conflict, with freely elected Governments in each country and with profound political, economic, social and other changes which have created a climate conducive to the promotion of economic growth and further progress towards the consolidation and further development of democratic, just and equitable societies,

	Reaffirming that the re-establishment of firm and lasting peace and democracy in Central America is a dynamic and ongoing process that faces serious structural challenges and whose continuation and consolidation are closely related to progress in human development, including the alleviation of extreme poverty, the promotion of economic and social justice, judicial reform, the safeguarding of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for minorities and the satisfaction of the basic needs of the most vulnerable groups among the people of the region, issues which have been a primary source of tension and conflict and which deserve to be discussed with the same urgency and dedication as was the case in the settlement of the armed conflicts,

	Emphasizing the joint participation of the presidents of the Central American countries in the general debate at its fifty-second session, during which, in accordance with the commitments undertaken, they reaffirmed their decision and political will to continue doing their utmost to expedite, gradually and progressively, the Central American Union referred to in the Declaration of Nicaragua of 2 September 1997, as a higher expression of the common association called for in the Tegucigalpa Protocol of 12 December 1991,4

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General, the bodies and programmes of the United Nations system, and the international community to continue to support and verify in Guatemala the implementation of all the peace agreements signed under United Nations auspices, compliance with which is an essential condition for a firm and lasting peace in that country, and to provide their resolute support for the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala in the fulfilment of its mandate;

	7.	Recognizes the importance of the Central American Integration System as the necessary legal and institutional body for coordinating and harmonizing efforts to achieve economic, social, cultural, environmental and political integration of the Central American countries in accordance with the goals and priorities established by the Governments of the isthmus in order to consolidate peace and democratization, and calls upon the international community, the United Nations system and other international governmental and non-governmental organizations to provide generous and effective cooperation with a view to improving the competence and efficiency of the Central American Integration System in the fulfilment of its mandate;

	10.	Reaffirms the importance of international cooperation, in particular cooperation with the bodies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system, and the donor community in the new stage of consolidating peace and democracy in Central America, and urges them to continue to support Central American efforts to achieve those goals, bearing in mind the global framework of the new regional development strategy, which is in keeping with the collective aspirations and needs of the Central American peoples;

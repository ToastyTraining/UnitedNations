	Recalling further its resolution 57/270 B of 23 June 2003 on the integrated and coordinated implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic and social fields,
	Emphasizing the need to fully implement the global partnership for development and enhance the momentum generated by the 2005 World Summit in order to operationalize and implement the commitments made in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the 2005 World Summit, in the economic, social and related fields,
	Reaffirming the resolve expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration2 to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all the world's people, 
	Recognizing that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,
	Noting that particular attention must be given, in the context of globalization, to the objective of protecting, promoting and enhancing the rights and welfare of women and girls, as stated in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action,3
	Reaffirming the commitment to eradicate poverty and hunger and promote sustained economic growth, sustainable development and global prosperity for all and to promote the development of the productive sectors in developing countries to enable them to participate more effectively in and benefit from the process of globalization,
	Reaffirming also its strong support for fair globalization and its resolve to achieve the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all, and in this regard recalling the ministerial declaration adopted on 5 July 2006 by the high-level segment of the substantive session of the Economic and Social Council on the theme "Creating an environment at the national and international levels conducive to generating full and productive employment and decent work for all, and its impact on sustainable development",4 
	Reaffirming further the commitment to broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in international economic decision-making and norm-setting, and to that end stressing the importance of continuing efforts to reform the international financial architecture, and acknowledging the need for continued discussion on the issue of the voting power of developing countries in the Bretton Woods institutions, which remains a concern,
	Reaffirming its commitment to governance, equity and transparency in the financial, monetary and trading systems and its commitment to open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial systems,
	Recognizing that countries diverge greatly in terms of their abilities to access, diffuse and use scientific and technological knowledge, most of which is generated in developed countries, 
	Recognizing also that developing countries have varying capacities to translate scientific and technological knowledge into goods and services and to invest in human resources and entrepreneurial capacity-building,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;5
	2.	Recognizes that some countries have successfully adapted to the changes and benefited from globalization but many others, especially the least developed countries, have remained marginalized in the globalizing world economy, and recognizes also that, as stated in the Millennium Declaration,2 the benefits are very unevenly shared, while the costs are unevenly distributed;
	3.	Reaffirms the need for the United Nations to  play a fundamental role in the promotion of international cooperation for development and the coherence, coordination and implementation of development goals and actions agreed upon by the international community, and resolves to strengthen coordination within the United Nations system in close cooperation with all other multilateral financial, trade and development institutions in order to support sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and sustainable development;
	4.	Underlines that in addressing the linkages between globalization and sustainable development, particular focus should be placed on identifying and implementing mutually reinforcing policies and practices that promote sustained economic growth, social development and environmental protection and that this requires efforts at both the national and international levels;
	5.	Reaffirms that good governance is essential for sustainable development; that sound economic policies, solid democratic institutions responsive to the needs of the people and improved infrastructure are the basis for sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and employment creation; and that freedom, peace and security, domestic stability, respect for human rights, including the right to development, and the rule of law, gender equality, market-oriented policies and an overall commitment to just and democratic societies are also essential and mutually reinforcing;
	6.	Reaffirms also that good governance at the international level is fundamental for achieving sustainable development, that, in order to ensure a dynamic and enabling international economic environment, it is important to promote global economic governance through addressing the international finance, trade, technology and investment patterns that have an impact on the development prospects of developing countries and that to this end the international community should take all necessary and appropriate measures, including ensuring support for structural and macroeconomic reform, a comprehensive solution to the external debt problem and increasing the market access of developing countries;
	7.	Underlines the fact that the increasing interdependence of national economies in a globalizing world and the emergence of rule-based regimes for international economic relations have meant that the space for national economic policy, i.e., the scope for domestic policies, especially in the areas of trade, investment and industrial development, is now often framed by international disciplines and commitments and global market considerations, that it is for each Government to evaluate the trade-off between the benefits of accepting international rules and commitments and the constraints posed by the loss of policy space and that it is particularly important for developing countries, bearing in mind development goals and objectives, that all countries take into account the need for appropriate balance between national policy space and international disciplines and commitments;
	8.	Reaffirms that each country has primary responsibility for its own development, that the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized in the achievement of sustainable development and that national efforts should be complemented by supportive global programmes, measures and policies aimed at expanding the development opportunities of developing countries, while taking into account national conditions and ensuring respect for national ownership, strategies and sovereignty; 
	9.	Stresses the special importance of creating an enabling international economic environment through strong cooperative efforts by all countries and institutions to promote equitable economic development in a world economy that benefits all people; 
	10.	Invites developed countries, in particular major industrialized economies, to take into account the effect of their macroeconomic policies on international growth and development; 
	11.	Recognizes, at the same time, that domestic economies are now interwoven with the global economic system and that, inter alia, the effective use of trade and investment opportunities can help countries to fight poverty;
	12.	Stresses that, in the increasingly globalizing interdependent world economy, a holistic approach to the interconnected national, international and systemic challenges of financing for development, namely, sustainable, gender-sensitive and people-centred development, is essential and that such an approach must open up opportunities for all and help to ensure that resources are created and used effectively and that solid and accountable institutions are established at all levels; 
	13.	Recognizes that the gap in technology and scientific capabilities between developed and developing countries, especially the least developed countries, is a continuing concern, as it impedes the capacity of many developing countries to participate fully in the global economy; 
	14.	Recognizes also that science and technology are vital for sharing the benefits of globalization, and stresses that the technology gap between developed and developing countries constitutes a major challenge for developing countries in their efforts to achieve development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals; 
	15.	Recognizes further that making globalization a positive force for all can be accomplished through the involvement, cooperation and partnership of Governments and other stakeholders and that promoting international cooperation for development and promoting policy coherence on global development issues are indispensable to that end;
	16.	Urges the international community to continue to work towards facilitating an adequate diffusion of scientific and technical knowledge and transfer of, access to and acquisition of technology for developing countries;
	17.	Stresses the need to promote and facilitate access to the development, transfer and diffusion of technologies for the developing countries through the articulation of policies and measures to foster an enabling environment to facilitate the acquisition and development of technology and to enhance innovation capacity, on the basis of the mandates contained in the Doha Ministerial Declaration;6 
	18.	Calls for technical and financial assistance to developing countries in their efforts to build the human and institutional capacity needed to pursue policies that strengthen their national innovation systems and that encourage investments in science and technology education not only for the generation of new technologies but also for the acquisition of the capacities to adapt science and technology developed elsewhere to local conditions; 
	19.	Recognizes that science and technology, including information and communication technologies, are vital for the achievement of development goals and that international support can help developing countries to benefit from technological advancements and enhance their productive capacity, and in this regard reaffirms the commitment to promoting and facilitating, as appropriate, access to and the development, transfer and diffusion of technologies, including environmentally sound technologies and corresponding know-how, for developing countries; 
	20.	Welcomes existing mechanisms and initiatives which assist developing countries in accessing technologies, encourages the strengthening and enhancement of existing mechanisms and the consideration of initiatives, including the creation of international databases on knowledge and research information, so as to assist developing countries in accessing technologies and know-how for creating technology-based enterprises and upgrading existing industries, and also encourages the strengthening of assistance to developing countries to enhance digital opportunities for all people, putting the potential of information and communication technologies to work in accessing technologies and know-how; 
	21.	Encourages existing arrangements and the further promotion of regional, subregional and interregional joint research and development projects by, where feasible, mobilizing existing scientific and research and development resources and by networking sophisticated scientific facilities and research equipment;
	22.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-second session a report on globalization and interdependence on the theme "Impact that, inter alia, international commitments, policies and processes can have on the scope and the implementation of national development strategies" under the item entitled "Globalization and interdependence".

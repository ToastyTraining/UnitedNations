	Noting also that the Institute receives no subsidy from the United Nations regular budget and that it provides training programmes to all Member States free of charge,

Renews its appeal to all Governments, in particular those of developed countries, and to private institutions that have not yet contributed financially or otherwise to the Institute, to give it their generous financial and other support, and urges the States that have interrupted their voluntary contributions to consider resuming them in view of the successful restructuring and revitalization of the Institute;
	8.	Encourages the Board of Trustees of the Institute to continue its efforts to resolve the critical financial situation of the Institute, in particular with a view to broadening its donor base and to increasing the contributions to the General Fund;

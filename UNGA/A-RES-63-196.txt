	Aware of the devastating impact of crime on the national economies of African States and of the fact that crime is a major obstacle to harmonious and sustainable development in Africa,

	1.	Commends the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders for its efforts to promote and coordinate regional technical cooperation activities related to crime prevention and criminal justice systems in Africa; 
	2.

	3.	Further commends the Secretary-General for his efforts to mobilize the financial resources necessary to provide the Institute with the core professional staff required to enable it to function effectively in the fulfilment of its mandated obligations; 
	4.	Reiterates the need to strengthen further the capacity of the Institute to support national mechanisms for crime prevention and criminal justice in African countries;

	12.	Calls upon the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to continue to work closely with the Institute;
	13.	Requests the Secretary-General to enhance the promotion of regional cooperation, coordination and collaboration in the fight against crime, especially in its transnational dimension, which cannot be dealt with adequately by national action alone;

	6.	Urges Member States that have not yet done so to pay special attention to the considerable psychological, social and economic damage associated with kidnapping by adopting legislative, administrative or any other measures to provide appropriate support and assistance to victims and their families;
	7.	Requests the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources, to prepare a handbook, for use by competent authorities, of proven and promising practices in the fight against kidnapping, including:

	(d)	Response to and management of crises;
	(e)	Identification of the minimum elements that would help States to make adjustments to their domestic legislation with a view to having a common understanding of the crime of kidnapping, which would also help to ascertain reliable trends from a global perspective;
	(f)	Development of specialized measures for providing support and assistance to victims and their families;
	(g)	Information on national authorities responsible for preventing and combating kidnapping;
	(h)	Reporting procedures, rescue operations, information systems and prosecutions;

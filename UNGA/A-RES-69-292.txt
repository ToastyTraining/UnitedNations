	(f)	Requests the President of the Assembly to invite the regional groups to nominate candidates to the bureau as soon as possible;
	(g)	Recognizes the desirability that any legally binding instrument relating to marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction under the Convention would secure the widest possible acceptance, and for that reason;

	(i)	Recognizes the importance of proceeding efficiently in the preparatory committee on the development of the elements of a draft text of an international legally binding instrument under the Convention, and recognizes further that any elements where consensus is not attained, even after exhausting every effort, may also be included in a section of the recommendations of the preparatory committee to the General Assembly;

	(k)	Decides that, before the end of its seventy-second session, and taking into account the aforementioned report of the preparatory committee, it will decide on the convening and on the starting date of an intergovernmental conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, to consider the recommendations of the preparatory committee on the elements and to elaborate the text of an international legally binding instrument under the Convention;

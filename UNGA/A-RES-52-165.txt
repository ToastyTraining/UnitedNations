	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of Sixth Committee (A/52/653)]


52/165.Measures to eliminate international terrorism

	The General Assembly,

	Guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling all its relevant resolutions, including resolution 49/60 of 9 December 1994, by which it adopted the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism, and resolutions 50/53 of 11 December 1995 and 51/210 of 17 December 1996,

	Recalling also the Declaration on the Occasion of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the United Nations,1

	Deeply disturbed by the persistence of terrorist acts, which have taken place worldwide,

	Stressing the need further to strengthen international cooperation between States and between international organizations and agencies, regional organizations and arrangements and the United Nations in order to prevent, combat and eliminate terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever committed,

	Mindful of the need to enhance the role of the United Nations and the relevant specialized agencies in combating international terrorism, and of the proposals of the Secretary-General to enhance the role of the Organization in this respect,

	Recalling that in the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism contained in the annex to resolution 49/60 the General Assembly encouraged States to review urgently the scope of the existing international legal provisions on the prevention, repression and elimination of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, with the aim of ensuring that there was a comprehensive legal framework covering all aspects of the matter,


	Bearing in mind the possibility of considering in the near future the elaboration of a comprehensive convention on international terrorism,

	Having examined the report of the Secretary-General,2

	1.	Strongly condemns all acts, methods and practices of terrorism as criminal and unjustifiable, wherever and by whomsoever committed;

	2.	Reiterates that criminal acts intended or calculated to provoke a state of terror in the general public, a group of persons or particular persons for political purposes are in any circumstance unjustifiable, whatever the considerations of a political, philosophical, ideological, racial, ethnic, religious or other nature that may be invoked to justify them;

	3.	Reiterates its call upon all States to adopt further measures in accordance with the relevant provisions of international law, including international standards of human rights, to prevent terrorism and to strengthen international cooperation in combating terrorism and, to that end, to consider, in particular, the implementation of the measures set out in paragraphs 3 (a) to (f) of its resolution 51/210;

	4.	Also reiterates its call upon all States, with the aim of enhancing the efficient implementation of relevant legal instruments, to intensify, as and where appropriate, the exchange of information on facts related to terrorism and, in so doing, to avoid the dissemination of inaccurate or unverified information;

	5.	Further reiterates its call upon States to refrain from financing, encouraging, providing training for or otherwise supporting terrorist activities;

	6.	Urges all States that have not yet done so to consider, as a matter of priority, becoming parties to relevant conventions and protocols as referred to in paragraph 6 of resolution 51/210, and calls upon all States to enact, as appropriate, domestic legislation necessary to implement the provisions of those conventions and protocols, to ensure that the jurisdiction of their courts enables them to bring to trial the perpetrators of terrorist acts and to cooperate with and provide support and assistance to other States and relevant international and regional organizations to that end;

	7.	Reaffirms the Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism contained in the annex to resolution 49/60 and the Declaration to Supplement the 1994 Declaration on Measures to Eliminate International Terrorism contained in the annex to resolution 51/210, and calls upon all States to implement them;

	8.	Reaffirms also the mandate of the Ad Hoc Committee established by General Assembly resolution 51/210 of 17 December 1996;

	9.	Decides that the Ad Hoc Committee shall meet from 16 to 27 February 1998 to continue its work in accordance with the mandate provided in paragraph 9 of resolution 51/210, and recommends that the work continue during the fifty-third session of the General Assembly from 28 September to 9 October 1998 within the framework of a working group of the Sixth Committee;


	10.	Requests the Secretary-General to invite the International Atomic Energy Agency to assist the Ad Hoc Committee in its deliberations;

	11.	Also requests the Secretary-General to continue to provide the Ad Hoc Committee with the necessary facilities for the performance of its work;

	12.	Requests the Ad Hoc Committee to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-third session on progress made in accomplishing its mandate;

	13.	Recommends that the Ad Hoc Committee be convened in 1999 to continue its work as referred to in paragraph 9 of resolution 51/210;

	14.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-third session the item entitled "Measures to eliminate international terrorism".

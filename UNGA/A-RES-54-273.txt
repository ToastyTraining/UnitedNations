	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

54/273.	Financing of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina

    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina1 and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2 

    Having considered also the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the investigation into allegations of fraud in travel at the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina,3

    Recalling Security Council resolution 1035 (1995) of 21 December 1995, by which the Council established the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina for an initial period of one year, and Council resolution 1247 (1999) of 18 June 1999, by which the Council extended the mandate of the Mission until 21 June 2000,

    Recalling also Security Council resolution 1285 (2000) of 13 January 2000, in which the Council authorized the United Nations military observers to continue to monitor the demilitarization of the Prevlaka peninsula until 15 July 2000,

    Recalling further its decision 50/481 of 11 April 1996 on the financing of the Mission and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 53/233 of 8 June 1999,
    
    Reaffirming that the costs of the Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

    Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Mission,

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

    1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina as at 30 April 2000, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 53.6 million United States dollars, representing 8 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Mission to the period ending 21 June 2000, notes that some 41 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

    8.	Endorses the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,4 and requests the Secretary-General to ensure their full implementation;

    9.	Takes note of the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services on the investigation into allegations of fraud in travel at the United Nations Mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina;3

    10.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

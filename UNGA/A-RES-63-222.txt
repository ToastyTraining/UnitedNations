[on the report of the Second Committee (A/63/416/Add.1)]
63/222.	Role of the United Nations in promoting development in the context of globalization and interdependence


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 53/169 of 15 December 1998, 54/231 of 22 December 1999, 55/212 of 20 December 2000, 56/209 of 21 December 2001, 57/274 of 20 December 2002, 58/225 of 23 December 2003, 59/240 of 22 December 2004, 60/204 of 22 December 2005, 61/207 of 20 December 2006 and 62/199 of 19 December 2007 on the role of the United Nations in promoting development in the context of globalization and interdependence, 
	Recalling also the 2005 World Summit Outcome1 and all relevant General Assembly resolutions, in particular those that have built upon the 2005 World Summit Outcome, in the economic, social and related fields, including resolution 60/265 of 30 June 2006 on follow-up to the development outcome of the 2005 World Summit, including the Millennium Development Goals and the other internationally agreed development goals, 
	Reaffirming that the United Nations has a central role in promoting international cooperation for development and in promoting policy coherence on global development issues, including in the context of globalization and interdependence, 
	Reaffirming also the resolve expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration2 to ensure that globalization works as a positive force for all,
	Recognizing that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,
	Recognizing also that globalization, driven largely by economic liberalization and technology, implies that the economic performance of a country is increasingly affected by factors outside its geographical borders and that maximizing in an equitable manner the benefits of globalization requires developing responses to globalization through a strengthened global partnership for development to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, 
	Expressing concern that the number of people living in poverty is higher than previously estimated,3 despite significant progress, and that the current financial and food insecurity crises and unpredictable energy prices may pose significant challenges for the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals,
	Recognizing that domestic economies are now interwoven with the global economy and that globalization affects all countries in different ways, and that countries on the one hand have trade and investment opportunities to, inter alia, fight poverty, while on the other hand they face constraints in the degree of flexibility they have in pursuing their national development strategies, 
	Reaffirming its strong support for fair and inclusive globalization and the need to translate growth into reduction of poverty and, in this regard, its resolve to make the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all, including for women and young people, a central objective of relevant national and international policies as well as national development strategies, including poverty reduction strategies, as part of efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals,
	Noting that particular attention must be given, in the context of globalization, to the objective of protecting, promoting and enhancing the rights and welfare of women and girls, as stated in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action,4
	Reaffirming its commitment to governance, equity and transparency in the financial, monetary and trading systems and its commitment to open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial systems, 
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;5
	2.	Expresses deep concern at the impact of the current financial crisis and global economic slowdown on the ability of developing countries to gain access to the financing necessary for their development objectives, and underlines the fact that developing countries and countries with economies in transition risk suffering very serious setbacks to their development objectives, in particular the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals;
	3.	Recognizes the measures adopted by Governments to address the present financial crisis, and, in that regard, calls upon all countries to manage their macroeconomic and financial policies in ways that contribute to global stability and sustained economic growth and sustainable development;
	4.	Also recognizes that greater coherence is required among the macroeconomic, trade, aid, financial, environmental and gender-equality policies to support the common aim of ensuring that globalization works as a positive force for all; 
	5.	Further recognizes that new and highly globalized financial instruments continue to change the nature of risks in the world economy, requiring continuing enhancement of market oversight and regulation, and underlines the fact that, to strengthen the resilience of the international financial system, reforms will need to be implemented that will strengthen the regulatory and supervisory frameworks of financial markets; 
	6.	Underlines the fact that economies exist in a globalizing world where the emergence of rule-based regimes for international economic relations has meant that the space for national economic policy, that is to say the scope for domestic policies, especially in the areas of trade, investment and industrial development, is now often framed by international disciplines, commitments and global market considerations, that it is for each Government to evaluate the trade-off between the benefits of accepting international rules and commitments and the constraints posed by the loss of policy space, and that it is particularly important for developing countries, bearing in mind development goals and objectives, that all countries take into account the need for appropriate balance between national policy space and international disciplines and commitments, and, in this regard, notes with appreciation the outcome of the twelfth session of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, held in Accra from 20 to 25 April 2008;6
	7.	Reaffirms that good governance is essential for sustainable development, that sound economic policies, solid democratic institutions responsive to the needs of the people and improved infrastructure are the basis for sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and employment creation, and that freedom, peace and security, domestic stability, respect for human rights, including the right to development, and the rule of law, gender equality, market-oriented policies and an overall commitment to just and democratic societies are also essential and mutually reinforcing; 
	8.	Also reaffirms that good governance at the international level is fundamental for achieving sustainable development, that, in order to ensure a dynamic and enabling international economic environment, it is important to promote global economic governance by addressing the international finance, trade, technology and investment patterns that have an impact on the development prospects of developing countries and that, to this end, the international community should take all necessary and appropriate measures, including ensuring support for structural and macroeconomic reform, a comprehensive solution to the external debt problem and increasing the market access of developing countries; 
	9.	Further reaffirms that each country has primary responsibility for its own development, that the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized in the achievement of sustainable development, and that national efforts should be complemented by supportive global programmes, measures and policies aimed at expanding the development opportunities of developing countries, while taking into account national conditions and ensuring respect for national ownership, strategies and sovereignty; 
	10.	Reaffirms the commitment to broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in international economic decision-making and norm-setting, stresses, to that end, the importance of continuing efforts to reform the international financial architecture, noting that enhancing the voice and participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the Bretton Woods institutions remains a continuous concern, and calls in this regard for further and effective progress; 
	11.	Stresses the need for increased support for investment in agricultural productivity, particularly in developing countries, in order to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals; 
	12.	Encourages all development partners to help to strengthen and support the national health and education policies and plans of developing countries by providing assistance and funding in accordance with their development needs and priorities; 
	13.	Calls upon Governments to assign a high priority to education, including by establishing institutions, in particular for basic education and vocational training, and improving access to and the quality of primary, secondary and tertiary education, including by developing a clear vision for the long-term development of a comprehensive, diversified and well-articulated tertiary education system; 
	14.	Calls upon countries to increase public expenditure and encourage greater private and community investment to achieve international goals and targets in the areas of health, nutrition and sanitation consistent with public policy objectives related to equitable access as well as meeting the specific health goals of reducing child and maternal mortality and reducing the spread of diseases such as HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria; 
	15.	Calls upon all countries to promote sustainable consumption and production patterns, with the developed countries taking the lead and all countries benefiting from the process, taking into account the Rio principles, including, inter alia, the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities as set out in principle 7 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development;7 
	16.	Stresses the need for all countries to harness knowledge and technology and stimulate innovation if they are to improve their competitiveness and benefit from trade and investment, and in this regard underlines the importance of concrete actions to facilitate technology transfer under fair, transparent and mutually agreed terms to developing countries in support of the implementation of their sustainable development strategies;
	17.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session a report on the theme "Globalization and interdependence: the role of the United Nations in poverty reduction and sustainable development" under the item entitled "Globalization and interdependence"; 
	18.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-fourth session, under the item entitled "Globalization and interdependence", the sub-item entitled "Role of the United Nations in promoting development in the context of globalization and interdependence".

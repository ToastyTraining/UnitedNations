	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[without reference to a Main Committee (A/52/L.10 and Add.1)]


52/9.University for Peace

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling that in its resolution 34/111 of 14 December 1979 it approved the idea of establishing the University for Peace as a specialized international centre for postgraduate studies, research and the dissemination of knowledge specifically aimed at training and education for peace and its universal promotion within the United Nations system,

	Recalling also that in its resolution 35/55 of 5 December 1980 it approved the establishment of the University for Peace in conformity with the International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace,1

	Recalling further its resolutions 45/8 of 24 October 1990 and 46/11 of 24 October 1991, on the tenth anniversary of the University for Peace and the report of the Secretary-General on that anniversary,2 its resolution 48/9 of 25 October 1993, in which it decided to include in the agenda of its fiftieth session the item entitled "University for Peace", and its resolution 50/41 of 8 December 1995, in which it decided to include in the agenda of its fifty-second session the item entitled "University for Peace" and requested the Secretary-General to consider ways of strengthening cooperation between the United Nations and the University for Peace and to submit a report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session,

	Recognizing once again that the University has suffered from financial limitations which have impeded the full development of the activities and programmes necessary for carrying out its important mandate,

	Recognizing also the important and varied activities carried out by the University during the period 1995-1997, largely thanks to the financial contributions made by Canada, Costa Rica and Spain and contributions by foundations and non-governmental organizations,


	Noting that in 1991 the Secretary-General, with the assistance of the United Nations Development Programme, established a Trust Fund for Peace consisting of voluntary contributions in order to provide the University with the means necessary to extend its sphere of activity to the rest of the world, to take full advantage of its potential capacity for education, research and support of the United Nations and to carry out its mandate of promoting peace in the world,

	Noting also that the University has placed special emphasis, in the context of the report of the Secretary-General entitled "An Agenda for Peace",3 on the area of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peace-building, as well as on the peaceful settlement of disputes, and that it has launched programmes in the area of democratic consensus-building and in the training of academic experts in the techniques of the peaceful settlement of conflicts, as well as a broad programme in Central America and the Caribbean on the building of cultures of peace,

	Considering the importance of promoting an education for peace which will help to foster respect for the values inherent in peace and universal coexistence among human beings, such as respect for life, friendship and solidarity between peoples and the dignity and integrity of persons irrespective of their nationality, race, sex, religion or culture,

	Considering with appreciation that the Government of Uruguay established in 1997 in the city of Montevideo a World Centre for Research and Information on Peace, by agreement with the University for Peace, which gave that Centre the status of regional sub-headquarters of the University for Peace for South America,

	Taking into account the efforts being made by the United Nations and by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization for the development and promotion of a new culture of peace,

	Recalling that in its resolution 46/11 it decided to include in the agenda of its forty-eighth session and biennially thereafter an item entitled "University for Peace",

	1.	Requests the Secretary-General, in view of the intense work done by the University for Peace, to consider ways of strengthening cooperation between the United Nations and the University for Peace and to submit a report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session;

	2.	Invites Member States, non-governmental organizations and intergovernmental bodies, as well as interested organizations and individuals, to contribute directly to the Trust Fund for Peace and to the budget of the University;

	3.	Invites Member States to accede to the International Agreement for the Establishment of the University for Peace, thereby demonstrating their support for a global peace studies institution whose mandate is the promotion of a global culture of peace;

	4.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-fourth session the item entitled "University for Peace".

Introduction
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General submitted to the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 67/226 on the quadrennial comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system;3
	2.	Also takes note of the note by the Secretary-General transmitting the report of the Joint Inspection Unit on an analysis of the resource mobilization function within the United Nations system4 and the note by the Secretary-General transmitting his comments and those of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination thereon,5 and decides to postpone the consideration of these documents to its seventy-first session, in 2016;
	3.	Further takes note of the reports of the High-level Committee on South-South Cooperation on its eighteenth session6 and on its intersessional meeting held on 8 September 2015,7 and welcomes the decisions adopted at those meetings;8
	4.	Recalls Economic and Social Council resolution 2015/15 on operational activities for development, and expresses appreciation for the guidance provided by the Council on the implementation of General Assembly resolution 67/226;
	5.	Reaffirms the request by the Economic and Social Council that the United Nations funds and programmes make every effort to continue to improve monitoring and data-collection methods, with a view to contributing to the further enhancement of the analytical quality of the report of the Secretary-General on operational activities for development of the United Nations system;
	6.	Urges the organizations of the United Nations development system with responsibility for operational activities for development that have not done so to fully align their strategic plans and their strategic planning and budgeting cycles with the quadrennial comprehensive policy review, taking into account their respective mandates;
	7.	Recognizes the importance of continuing to strengthen and improve the results-focused delivery of operational activities for development of the funds and programmes of the United Nations system in order to maximize their support towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, which build upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seek to address their unfinished business, also recognizes in this regard that the most vulnerable countries, in particular African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, deserve special attention, as do countries in situations of conflict and post-conflict countries, and further recognizes that there are also serious challenges within many middle-income countries;
	8.	Calls upon the organizations of the United Nations development system at Headquarters, regional and country levels to improve coordination among organizations working on common themes;

Funding of operational activities for development of the United Nations system
	9.	Reiterates that core resources, because of their untied nature, continue to be the bedrock of the operational activities for development of the United Nations system, and in this regard recognizes the need for the organizations of the United Nations development system to address, on a continuous basis, the imbalance between core and non-core resources and to report to the Economic and Social Council in 2016, as part of their regular reporting, on the measures taken to address this imbalance;
	10.	Emphasizes that international public finance plays an important role in complementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited domestic resources, notes that an important use of international public finance, including official development assistance, is to catalyse additional resource mobilization from other sources, public and private, also notes that providers of official development assistance have reaffirmed their respective commitments, including the commitment by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance to developing countries and 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance to the least developed countries;
	11.	Reiterates the call for donor countries and other countries in a position to do so to maintain and substantially increase their voluntary contributions, in a manner consistent with their capacities, to the core or regular budgets of the organizations of the United Nations development system, in particular its funds, programmes and the specialized agencies, and to contribute on a multi-year basis in a sustained and predictable manner;
	12.	Notes that the majority of the increase in funding for the United Nations development system between 1998 and 2013 was in the form of non-core resources, resulting in an imbalance between core and non-core resources, and notes with concern that the percentage of core resources in the overall funding for operational activities continued to decline, representing only 25 per cent in 2013;
	13.	Stresses that funding for operational activities should be aligned with the national priorities and plans of the programme countries as well as the strategic plans, mandates, resource frameworks and priorities of the United Nations funds and programmes and the specialized agencies, and underscores in that regard the need to further strengthen the delivery of results and the results-based frameworks of the funds, programmes and the specialized agencies of the United Nations development system and to improve their reporting on outputs and nationally owned outcomes;
	14.	Notes that non-core resources represent an important contribution to the overall resource base of the United Nations development system and that they complement core resources in supporting operational activities for development, thereby contributing to an increase in total resources, while noting the need to make non-core resources more flexible, more predictable and better aligned with strategic plans and national priorities, and recognizes that non-core resources are not a substitute for core resources;
	15.	Recognizes that non-core resources pose challenges, in particular the use of restricted earmarked funding such as single-donor project-specific funding, by potentially increasing transaction costs, demand for additional reporting, fragmentation, competition and overlap among entities and providing disincentives for pursuing an Organization-wide focus, strategic positioning and coherence, and that they may also potentially distort programme priorities regulated by intergovernmental bodies and processes;
	16.	Notes with concern in this regard that contributions to pooled-funding arrangements, such as thematic funds of entities and United Nations multi-partner trust funds and joint programmes, accounted for only 10 per cent of non-core resource flows to development-related activities in 2013, and encourages all contributors of non-core resources to expand the use of less-restricted earmarked funding arrangements;
	17.	Notes the initiatives launched by the United Nations development system through the United Nations Development Group, in line with General Assembly resolution 67/226, aimed at further strengthening the use and management of joint funding mechanisms and approaches in order to improve the quality of non-core resources, and urges the United Nations development system to ensure that non-core resources are fully aligned with national needs and priorities and with the United Nations Development Assistance Framework process;
	18.	Welcomes the progress made by the United Nations funds and programmes and the specialized agencies in ensuring that available and projected core and non-core resources are consolidated within an integrated budgetary framework, based on the priorities of their respective strategic plans, and encourages all entities that have not already done so to develop such integrated frameworks in their next budget cycle;
	19.	Recalls the mandate contained in its resolution 67/226 with respect to taking concrete measures to broaden the donor base, and reiterates its requests to the United Nations funds and programmes, and encourages the specialized agencies, to report annually as part of their regular reporting to their governing bodies on concrete measures taken to broaden the donor base and increase the number of countries and other partners making contributions to the United Nations development system in order to reduce the reliance of the system on a limited number of donors;
	20.	Notes with concern that the mandate contained in its resolution 67/226 with respect to the development and operationalization of the concept of "critical mass" of core resources was not fulfilled as originally foreseen, notes the adoption in 2014 by the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations Office for Project Services of decisions 2014/24 and 2014/25 and the adoption by the Executive Board of the United Nations Children's Fund of decision 2014/17, in which they noted common principles for the concept of critical mass of resources and core resources, requests the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations Children's Fund to consult further with Member States on ways to ensure a critical mass of core resources, for consideration and action during the quadrennial comprehensive policy review in 2016, and reiterates the request to the United Nations funds and programmes that have not yet done so to define common principles for the concept of critical mass of core resources, which may include the level of resources adequate to respond to the needs of programme countries and to produce the results expected in the strategic plans, including administrative, management and programme costs, in consultation with Member States, with a view to a decision being taken by their respective governing bodies in 2016;
	21.	Stresses the need to avoid the use of core or regular resources to subsidize activities financed by non-core or extrabudgetary resources, reaffirms that the guiding principle governing the financing of all non-programme costs should be based on full cost recovery from core and non-core funding sources, proportionally, and in this regard notes the timelines agreed by the Executive Boards of the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Children's Fund and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) for an independent and external assessment, to be performed in 2016, of the consistency and alignment of the cost-recovery methodology with the quadrennial comprehensive policy review;
	22.	Takes note of decisions 2015/16 and 2015/18 adopted by the Executive Boards of the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations Office for Project Services, decision 2015/14 adopted by the Executive Board of the United Nations Children's Fund and decision 2015/5 adopted by the Executive Board of UN-Women on the organization of structured dialogues with Member States on ways to finance the development results agreed in the strategic planning cycles of the respective entities, and in this regard notes the progress made and requests the Executive Boards of the United Nations funds and programmes and the governing bodies of the specialized agencies, as appropriate, to continue to organize such structured dialogues on an annual basis, while ensuring adequate preparation, including through informal dialogues and exchanges of information and analysis throughout the year, as part of their regular schedule of meetings, with a view to making non-core resources more predictable and less restricted/earmarked, broadening the donor base and improving the adequacy and predictability of resource flows;
	23.	Calls upon United Nations country teams to adopt as a practice the use of common budgetary frameworks as soon as possible, which would not constitute a legal constraint on resource spending authority, and requests United Nations funds and programmes, and encourages the specialized agencies, to continue to provide the necessary information on contributions to the resident coordinators, upon agreement with programme countries, improve the timeliness and quality of information provided and ensure that the common budgetary framework is a useful and effective instrument for strengthening the quality of system-wide resource planning in support of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework process;

	25.	Requests the funds and programmes of the United Nations development system, and invites the specialized agencies, to consider the findings and observations related to national capacity gaps repeatedly highlighted by programme countries to be addressed through the work of the operational activities for development of the United Nations system, including through the strengthening and use of national capacities, and to report to their governing bodies in 2016 with recommendations for implementation in this regard;
	26.	Notes that national monitoring and reporting systems and national procurement, financial and evaluation capacities have been underused, and in this regard reiterates the mandate contained in its resolution 67/226 that the United Nations development system make increased use of national public and private systems for support services as a means of strengthening national capacities and reducing transaction costs;
	27.	Requests the Secretary-General to include in his report on the implementation of its resolution 67/226 to the Economic and Social Council in 2016, in consultation with Member States, information on steps taken by the organizations of the United Nations development system to strengthen and use national capacities, including ensuring the long-term impact of capacities built, and to make proposals to address any obstacles and challenges;

	28.	Welcomes the integration of poverty eradication, as the overarching priority, into the strategic plans of some organizations of the United Nations system, in accordance with their mandates;
	29.	Underlines the need to better reflect the multidimensional nature of development and poverty, as well as the importance of developing a common understanding among Member States and other stakeholders of that multidimensionality, looks forward to a discussion of this matter in the context of the ongoing dialogues of the Economic and Social Council and the quadrennial comprehensive policy review in 2016, and in the context of the implementation and follow-up of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development9 and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda,10 and in this regard invites Member States, supported by the international community, to consider developing complementary measurements, including methodologies and indicators for measuring human development, that better reflect that multidimensionality;

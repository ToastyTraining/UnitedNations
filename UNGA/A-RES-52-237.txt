	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/52/932)]


52/237.		Financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon


	The General Assembly,

	Reaffirming its resolution 51/233 of 13 June 1997,

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978, by which the Council established the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force, the latest of which was resolution 1151 (1998) of 30 January 1998,

	Recalling its resolution S-8/2 of 21 April 1978 on the financing of the Force and its subsequent resolutions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 51/233, 


	Reaffirming that the costs of the Force are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	Concerned that the Secretary-General continues to face difficulties in meeting the obligations of the Force on a current basis, including reimbursement to current and former troop-contributing States,

	Concerned also that the surplus balances in the Special Account for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon have been used to meet expenses of the Force in order to compensate for the lack of income resulting from non-payment and late payment by Member States of their contributions,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon as at 15 May 1998, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 106.2 million United States dollars, representing 3.8 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Force to the period ending 30 June 1998, notes that some 18.3 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	3.	Expresses its deep concern that Israel did not comply with General Assembly resolution 51/233;

	4.	Stresses once again that Israel should strictly abide by General Assembly resolution 51/233;

	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure the full implementation of paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution 51/233, stressing that Israel shall pay the amount of 1,773,618 dollars resulting from the incident at Qana on 18 April 1996;

	6.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

	7.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Force in full and on time;

	8.	Takes note of the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;2

	9.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Force is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

	10.	Also requests the Secretary-General, in order to reduce the cost of employing General Service staff, to continue efforts to employ locally recruited staff for the Force against General Service posts, commensurate with the operational requirements of such posts;

	11.	Decides, as an ad hoc arrangement, to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon the amount of 142,984,560 dollars gross (139,133,160 dollars net) for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999, inclusive of the amount of 7,152,660 dollars for the support account for peacekeeping operations, to be apportioned among Member States at the monthly rate of 11,915,380 dollars gross (11,594,430 dollars net), in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996, 51/218 A to C of 18 December 1996 and 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and 50/451 B of 23 December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the years 1998 and 1999, as set out in its resolution 52/215 A of 22 December 1997, subject to the decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the Force beyond 31 July 1998;

	12.

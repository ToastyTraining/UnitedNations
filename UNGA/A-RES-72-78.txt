	2.	Recall that the Treaty on Principles Governing the Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon and Other Celestial Bodies, was adopted by the General Assembly in its resolution 2222 (XXI) of 19 December 1966, was opened for signature in London, Moscow and Washington, D.C., on 27 January 1967, and entered into force on 10 October 1967;
	3.	Note that, as at 1 January 2017, 105 States had become parties to the Treaty and an additional 25 States had signed it;
	4.	Reaffirm the fundamental role played by the Treaty in maintaining outer space for peaceful purposes and in furthering the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, in the interest of maintaining international peace and security and promoting international cooperation and understanding;
	5.	Are convinced that the Treaty and its principles, as reflected in its articles I to XIII, will continue to provide an indispensable framework for the conduct of outer space activities, which continue to hold immense potential to deliver further advancements in human knowledge, to drive socioeconomic progress for all humankind and to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030;
	6.	Recognize that the achievements made in space exploration and the development of space science and technology for the benefit of all humankind, and international cooperation initiatives to those ends, have exceeded all expectations existing at the time of the adoption of the Treaty;
	7.	Acknowledge that there has been a significant rise in the importance to States of space science and technology applications, which enable greater understanding of the universe and of the Earth and contribute to advances in, inter alia, education, health, environmental monitoring, the management of natural resources on Earth, disaster management, meteorological forecasting, climate modelling, the protection of cultural heritage, information technology and satellite navigation and communications, and to the well-being of humanity through economic, social and cultural development;
	8.	Are deeply convinced that strengthening the long-term sustainability of outer space activities requires efforts at the national, regional, interregional and international levels;
	9.	Emphasize the constantly evolving and increasingly multifaceted nature of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, with fundamentally complex scientific and technological advancements in the space field and an increasing variety of actors in the space arena, and therefore encourage the building of stronger partnership, cooperation and coordination;
	10.	Recognize the need for further promotion of international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space, taking into account the particular needs of developing countries;
	11.	Call upon all States parties to the Treaty conducting outer space activities to work under the principles of cooperation and mutual assistance, paying due regard to the corresponding interests of other parties to the Treaty;
	12.	Are inspired by the prospects that continue to open up before humankind as a result of human activities in outer space;
	13.	Encourage States that have not yet become parties to the Treaty, in particular those States that are members of the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, to consider becoming party to it;
	14.	Emphasize, in this regard, that the benefits arising from adherence to the Treaty, as part of the legal regime of outer space, are significant for all States, irrespective of the degree of their economic or scientific development, and that being party to the Treaty would enhance the ability of States to become part of international cooperation efforts in the exploration and use of outer space for peaceful purposes;
	15.	Reiterate the role of the Treaty as the cornerstone of the international legal regime governing outer space activities and that the Treaty manifests the fundamental principles of international space law;
	16.	Affirm that the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space, together with its Legal Subcommittee and Scientific and Technical Subcommittee, has a distinguished historical record in the establishment and further development of the international legal regime governing outer space activities, that under that regime, outer space activities by States, international intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental entities are flourishing and that, as a result, space science and technology and their applications contribute immeasurably to economic growth and improvements in the quality of life around the world;
	17.	Call upon the Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space and its Legal Subcommittee to continue, with the support of the Office for Outer Space Affairs of the Secretariat, to promote the widest adherence to the Treaty, and its application by States, and to foster the progressive development of international space law;
	18.	Request the Office for Outer Space Affairs to continue fostering capacity-building in space law and policy for the benefit of all countries and to continue providing assistance to developing countries, at their request, in the development of national space policy and legislation, in conformity with international space law.

	Recognizing also that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,

	Reaffirming further the commitment to broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in international economic decision-making and norm-setting, and to that end stressing the importance of continuing efforts to reform the international financial architecture, and noting that enhancing the voice and participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the Bretton Woods institutions is a continuing concern, 
	Reaffirming its commitment to governance, equity and transparency in the financial, monetary and trading systems and its commitment to open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial systems,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;4
	2.	Reaffirms the need for the United Nations to play a fundamental role in the promotion of international cooperation for development and the coherence, coordination and implementation of development goals and actions agreed upon by the international community, and resolves to strengthen coordination within the United Nations system in close cooperation with all other multilateral financial, trade and development institutions in order to support sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and sustainable development;
	3.	Reaffirms also that good governance is essential for sustainable development; that sound economic policies, solid democratic institutions responsive to the needs of the people and improved infrastructure are the basis for sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and employment creation; and that freedom, peace and security, domestic stability, respect for human rights, including the right to development, and the rule of law, gender equality, market-oriented policies and an overall commitment to just and democratic societies are also essential and mutually reinforcing;
	4.	Reaffirms further that good governance at the international level is fundamental for achieving sustainable development, that, in order to ensure a dynamic and enabling international economic environment, it is important to promote global economic governance through addressing the international finance, trade, technology and investment patterns that have an impact on the development prospects of developing countries, and that to this effect the international community should take all necessary and appropriate measures, including ensuring support for structural and macroeconomic reform, a comprehensive solution to the external debt problem and increasing the market access of developing countries;
	5.	Reaffirms that each country has primary responsibility for its own development, that the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized in the achievement of sustainable development and that national efforts should be complemented by supportive global programmes, measures and policies aimed at expanding the development opportunities of developing countries, while taking into account national conditions and ensuring respect for national ownership, strategies and sovereignty;
	6.	Recognizes, at the same time, that domestic economies are now interwoven with the global economic system and that, inter alia, the effective use of trade and investment opportunities can help countries to fight poverty;
	7.	Stresses that, in the increasingly globalizing interdependent world economy, a holistic approach to the interconnected national, international and systemic challenges of financing for development, namely, sustainable, gender-sensitive and people-centred development, is essential and that such an approach must open up opportunities for all and help to ensure that resources are created and used effectively and that solid and accountable institutions are established at all levels; 
	8.	Stresses also that development strategies have to be formulated with a view to minimizing the negative social impact of globalization and maximizing its positive impact, while striving to ensure that all groups of the population, in particular the poorest, benefit from it, and that at the international level, efforts should focus on the means to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals;
	9.	Stresses further that, in the common pursuit of growth, poverty eradication and sustainable development, a critical challenge is to ensure the necessary internal conditions for mobilizing domestic savings, both public and private, sustaining adequate levels of productive investment and increasing human capacity, while a crucial task is to enhance the efficacy, coherence and consistency of macroeconomic policies and an enabling domestic environment is vital for mobilizing domestic resources, increasing productivity, reducing capital flight, encouraging the private sector and attracting and making effective use of international investment and assistance, and in this regard stresses also that efforts to create such an environment should be supported by the international community;
	10.	Stresses the special importance of creating an enabling international economic environment through strong cooperative efforts by all countries and institutions to promote equitable economic development in a world economy that benefits all people;
	11.	Invites developed countries, in particular major industrialized economies, to take into account the effect of their macroeconomic policies on international growth and development;
	12.	Underlines the fact that the increasing interdependence of national economies in a globalizing world and the emergence of rule-based regimes for international economic relations have meant that the space for national economic policy, i.e., the scope for domestic policies, especially in the areas of trade, investment and industrial development, is now often framed by international disciplines, commitments and global market considerations, that it is for each Government to evaluate the trade-off between the benefits of accepting international rules and commitments and the constraints posed by the loss of policy space and that it is particularly important for developing countries, bearing in mind development goals and objectives, that all countries take into account the need for appropriate balance between national policy space and international disciplines and commitments;
	13.	Underlines also that in addressing the linkages between globalization and sustainable development, particular focus should be placed on identifying and implementing mutually reinforcing policies and practices that promote sustained economic growth, social development and environmental protection and that this requires efforts at both the national and international levels; 
	14.	Underlines further that the issue of enhancing the voice of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in the Bretton Woods institutions is of vital importance, stresses the importance of advancing ongoing work in this regard, taking into account progress in the context of the International Monetary Fund quota review, and invites the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to continue to provide information on this issue, using existing cooperation forums, including those involving Member States; 
	15.	Reaffirms the commitments made in the Doha Ministerial Declaration5 and the decision of the General Council of the World Trade Organization of 1 August 20046 to fulfil the development dimensions of the Doha Development Agenda, which places the needs and interests of developing and least developed countries at the heart of the Doha work programme,5 and calls for the successful and timely completion of the Doha round of trade negotiations with the fullest realization of the development dimensions of the Doha work programme, and looks to the Sixth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, to be held in Hong Kong, China, from 13 to 18 December 2005, to constitute an important milestone to this end; 
	16.	Stresses the importance of building a people-centred and inclusive information society so as to enhance digital opportunities for all people in order to help bridge the digital divide, putting the potential of information and communication technologies at the service of development and addressing the new challenges of the information society, and in this regard calls for the implementation of the outcomes of the World Summit on the Information Society;7 
	17.	Reaffirms that development is a central goal in itself and that sustainable development in its economic, social and environmental aspects constitutes a key element of the overarching framework of United Nations activities, stresses the importance of continuing efforts in this regard, and invites the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the regional development banks and other relevant institutions to further integrate development dimensions into their strategies and policies, consistent with their respective mandates; 
	18.	Reaffirms also that gender equality is of fundamental importance for achieving sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and sustainable development, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and United Nations conferences, and that investing in the development of women and girls has a multiplier effect, in particular on productivity, efficiency and sustained economic growth, in all sectors of economy, especially in key areas such as agriculture, industry and services; 
	19.	Invites relevant organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant multilateral bodies to provide information to the Secretary-General on their activities to promote an inclusive and equitable globalization;

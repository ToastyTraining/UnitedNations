Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 8 December 2005
[on the report of the First Committee (A/60/463)]
60/56.	Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: accelerating the implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 58/51 of 8 December 2003 and 59/75 of 3 December 2004,
	Also recalling the decisions and resolution on the Middle East of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons1 and the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,2
	Regretting the lack of any substantive outcome of the 2005 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, as well as the inability of the General Assembly, at its 2005 World Summit, to reach agreement on matters relating to nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation,
	Bearing in mind that 2005 marks the sixtieth anniversary of the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, and that humankind should never again be exposed to such horrific devastation,
	Expressing its grave concern at the danger to humanity posed by the possibility that nuclear weapons could be used,
	Noting the growing concern at the lack of implementation of binding obligations and agreed steps towards nuclear disarmament, 
	Reaffirming that nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are mutually reinforcing processes requiring urgent irreversible progress on both fronts,
	Recalling the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear disarmament, in accordance with commitments made under article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,3
	Underlining the importance of the Treaty and its universality to achieving nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation,
	1.	Reaffirms that the outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons sets out the framework for systematic and progressive efforts towards nuclear disarmament;2
	2.	Calls upon the nuclear-weapon States to accelerate the implementation of the practical steps towards nuclear disarmament that were agreed upon at the 2000 Review Conference, thereby contributing to a safer world for all;
	3.	Calls upon all States to comply fully with commitments made regarding nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation and not to act in any way that may be detrimental to either cause or that may lead to a new nuclear arms race;
	4.	Calls upon all States parties to spare no efforts to achieve the universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,3 and urges India, Israel and Pakistan, which are not yet parties to the Treaty, to accede to it as non-nuclear-weapon States promptly and without conditions; 
	5.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-first session the item entitled "Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: accelerating the implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments" and to review the implementation of the present resolution at that session.

[on the report of the Second Committee (A/62/425)]
62/210.	United Nations Institute for Training and Research


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 51/188 of 16 December 1996, 52/206 of 18 December 1997, 53/195 of 15 December 1998, 54/229 of 22 December 1999, 55/208 of 20 December 2000, 56/208 of 21 December 2001, 57/268 of 20 December 2002, 58/223 of 23 December 2003, 59/252 of 22 December 2004 and 60/213 of 22 December 2005 and its decision 61/542 of 20 December 2006,
	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,1
	Acknowledging the work of the Board of Trustees of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research on the functioning of the Institute,
	Expressing its deep gratitude for the dedication and commitment, as well as the accomplishments, of Mr. Marcel Boisard, Assistant Secretary-General and, for fifteen years, Executive Director of the Institute,
	Noting the continued progress made by the Institute in its various programmes and activities, including the strengthened cooperation with other organizations of the United Nations system and with regional and national institutions,
	Expressing its appreciation to the Governments and private institutions that have made or pledged financial and other contributions to the Institute,
	Noting that the activities of the Institute have thus far been funded entirely from voluntary contributions,
	Noting also that, despite the growing need for training and capacity development, voluntary contributions remain at a low level, putting at risk the Institute's core training courses that it delivers to diplomats and delegates accredited to United Nations Headquarters in New York and to the United Nations Offices at Geneva, Nairobi and Vienna,
	Reiterating that training and capacity-development activities should be accorded a more visible and larger role in support of the management of international affairs and in the execution of the economic and social development programmes of the United Nations system,
	1.	Notes the strategic reforms introduced by the new Executive Director of the United Nations Institute for Training and Research, and endorsed by its Board of Trustees, for the Institute to be a centre of excellence;
	2.	Reaffirms the importance of a coordinated United Nations system-wide approach to research and training, based on an effective coherent strategy and an effective division of work among the relevant institutions and bodies;
	3.	Also reaffirms the relevance of the Institute, in view of the growing importance of training and capacity development within the United Nations and the training requirements of States and local authorities, and the relevance of capacity development-related research activities undertaken by the Institute within its mandate;
	4.	Welcomes the progress made in building partnerships between the Institute and other organizations and bodies of the United Nations system with respect to their training and capacity-development programmes, and in this context underlines the need to develop further and to expand the scope of those partnerships, in particular at the country level;
	5.	Requests the Board of Trustees to continue to ensure fair and equitable geographic distribution and transparency in the preparation of the programmes and in the employment of experts, and in this regard stresses that the courses of the Institute should focus primarily on development issues and the management of international affairs;
	6.	Reiterates the importance of using objective, impartial and scientific course materials, compatible with the objectives and priorities of the United Nations, and expects a better screening of the course materials utilized by the Institute; 
	7.	Urges the Board of Trustees to complete expeditiously the implementation of the remaining recommendation made by the Board of Auditors in respect of the biennium 2002-2003, while appreciating the work done thus far;2 
	8.	Renews its appeal to all Governments, in particular those of developed countries, and to private institutions that have not yet contributed financially or otherwise to the Institute to give it their generous financial and other support, and urges the States that have interrupted their voluntary contributions to consider resuming them in view of the strategic reforms;
	9.	Encourages the Board of Trustees to continue its efforts to resolve the financial situation of the Institute, in particular with a view to broadening its donor base, and seeking more predictable and adequate support from Member States for its activities, in particular its core training activities;
	10.	Decides to streamline the reporting arrangements of the Institute through:
	(a)	Consolidation of the reports of the Secretary-General and the Executive Director of the Institute;
	(b)	Submission of the new consolidated report of the Secretary-General to the Economic and Social Council rather than to the General Assembly;
	(c)	Establishment of a biennial reporting cycle starting from 2009; 
	11.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the Economic and Social Council at its substantive session of 2008 a report on the implementation of the present resolution, including details on its financial implications, and the status of contributions to and the financial situation of the Institute.

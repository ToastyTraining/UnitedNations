	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/51/625)]


51/159.Action to be taken in 1999 dedicated to the centennial of the first International Peace Conference and to the closing of the United Nations Decade of International Law

	The General Assembly,

	Noting that the year 1999 will mark the one-hundredth anniversary of the historic first International Peace Conference, held at The Hague on the initiative of Russia,

	Recalling its resolution 44/23 of 17 November 1989, by which it proclaimed the United Nations Decade of International Law, to begin in 1990 and conclude in 1999, marking the centennial of the first International Peace Conference,

	Recognizing that the first and the second International Peace Conference, as well as the League of Nations and the United Nations subsequently, have significantly encouraged the progressive development and codification of international law and thereby contributed to the maintenance of international peace and security,

	Recognizing also the invaluable contribution of the first International Peace Conference to the settling or resolving of international disputes or situations which can cause the infringement of peace, by its adoption of the Convention for the Pacific Settlement of International Disputes1 and the establishment of the Permanent Court of Arbitration,

	Recalling that the Final Act of the second International Peace Conference1 incorporated a proposal to convene a third international peace conference,


	Recalling that one of the purposes of the United Nations is to maintain international peace and security, inter alia, by means of adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace,

	Recalling that, according to its resolution 44/23, one of the main purposes of the Decade of International Law is to promote means and methods for the settlement of disputes between States, including resort to and full respect for the International Court of Justice,

	Recalling also that, at the forty-fifth session of the General Assembly, the Sixth Committee convened the Working Group on the United Nations Decade of International Law with a view to preparing generally acceptable recommendations on the programme of activities for the Decade, and that the Working Group has been reconvened at all subsequent sessions of the General Assembly and was requested at the fiftieth session to continue its work,

	Stressing the need for the international community to continue efforts with a view to strengthening international peace and security, achieving full compliance with international law and promoting its progressive development,

	Recalling that in its resolution 44/23 it requested the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States and appropriate international bodies, as well as of non-governmental organizations working in the field, on the programme for the Decade and on appropriate action to be taken during the Decade, including the possibility of holding a third international peace conference or other suitable international conference at the end of the Decade,

	Noting that the heads of State or Government of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries at their ninth summit meeting reaffirmed General Assembly resolution 44/23 and the strong support of the Movement for the programme of the United Nations Decade of International Law, including the recommendation of holding a third international peace conference at the conclusion of the Decade on the occasion of the one-hundredth anniversary of the first International Peace Conference,

	Noting also the proposal by the Russian Federation for a third international peace conference with a view to considering international law and order in the post-cold-war world at the threshold of the twenty-first century,

	Convinced that the United Nations could assist significantly with its expertise and knowledge with the development of such a proposal,

	1.	Considers it desirable to draft a programme of action dedicated to the centennial of the first International Peace Conference and to the closing of the United Nations Decade of International Law in 1999;

	2.	Invites the Governments of the Russian Federation and the Netherlands to arrange, as a matter of urgency, a preliminary discussion with other interested Member States on the substantive content of action to be taken in 1999 and to seek, in this respect, the cooperation of the International Court of Justice, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, relevant intergovernmental organizations, as well as other relevant organizations;

	3.	Calls upon the competent United Nations organs, programmes and specialized agencies to study the possibilities of providing assistance to that end;




	4.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-second session, under the item entitled "United Nations Decade of International Law", a sub-item entitled "Action to be taken in 1999 dedicated to the centennial of the first International Peace Conference and to the closing of the United Nations Decade of International Law".

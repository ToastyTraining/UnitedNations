Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the question of Antarctica3 and the role accorded by the Secretary-General to the United Nations Environment Programme in preparing his report, and also of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meetings, which took place at Seoul from 8 to 19 May 1995 and at Utrecht, the Netherlands, from 29 April to 10 May 1996, respectively;

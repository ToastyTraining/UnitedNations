	72/99.	Question of the British Virgin Islands 


	The General Assembly, 
	Having considered the question of the British Virgin Islands and examined the relevant chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2017,1 
	Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on the British Virgin Islands2 and other relevant information, 
	Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people of the British Virgin Islands and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly, 
	Expressing concern that 57 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,3 there still remain 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including the British Virgin Islands, 
	Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second4 and Third International Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism, 
	Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of the British Virgin Islands require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, size of population or natural resources, 
	Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should continue to guide the development of their future political status and that referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people, 
	Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the Non-Self-Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by the use of the Territories as tax havens to the detriment of the world economy and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 1514 (XV), 
	Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views of the people of the British Virgin Islands in respect of their right to self-determination should be ascertained, 
	Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional organizations, 
	Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding of the political status of the people of the British Virgin Islands and to fulfil its mandate effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as the administering Power and to receive information from other appropriate sources, including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory, 
	Aware of the importance both to the British Virgin Islands and to the Special Committee of the participation of elected and appointed representatives of the British Virgin Islands in the work of the Committee, 
	Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at assisting the people of the British Virgin Islands with their inalienable right to self-determination and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self-determination, on a case-by-case basis, 
	Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of the Territories, 
	Welcoming the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme "Implementation of the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: the future for decolonization in the Non-Self-Governing Territories - what are the prospects?", held by the Special Committee in Kingstown and hosted by the Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines from 16 to 18 May 2017, as a significant and forward-looking event, which enabled the participants to assess progress made and address challenges faced in the decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and renew its commitment to implementing its historic task, 
	Recognizing the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee5 and which outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General Assembly of the period 2011-2020 as the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism,6 
	Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well as regional institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific, 
	Recalling the statement made by the Deputy Premier and Minister of Natural Resources and Labour, as a representative of the Government of the British Virgin Islands, at the Caribbean regional seminar held in Quito from 28 to 30 May 2013, 
	Taking into account that the Territory last participated in the activities of the Special Committee in 2013, when it was stated that, while the Territory's relationship with the administering Power was stable and not problematic, it could be enhanced, and in this regard stressing the importance of the continued participation of the Territory in order to provide the Committee with up-to-date information regarding the decolonization process,
	Cognizant of the potential usefulness of regional ties for the development of a small island Territory and of the Territory's membership in the Caribbean Overseas Countries and Territories Council, 
	Recalling the general elections which took place in June 2015,7

	Recalling also the Paris Declaration and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the 1990s,1 adopted by the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries on 14 September 1990, as well as the mutual commitments undertaken on that occasion and the importance attached to the follow-up to that Conference,

	Noting that the economic and social development efforts of Djibouti are constrained by the extremes of the local climate, in particular cyclical droughts and torrential rains and floods such as those that occurred in 1989, 1994 and, more recently, in October and November 1997, and that the implementation of reconstruction and development programmes, as well as of the demobilization programme, requires the deployment of substantial resources which exceed the real capacity of the country,

	Conscious that Djibouti is included in the list of least developed countries and that it is ranked 162nd out of the 175 countries studied in the Human Development Report 1997,15

	Noting that the situation in Djibouti has been made worse by the deteriorating situation in the Horn of Africa and in particular in Somalia, and noting also the presence of tens of thousands of refugees and persons displaced from their countries, which has placed serious strains on the fragile economic, social and administrative infrastructure of Djibouti and caused security problems in the country, in particular in the city of Djibouti,

	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,16

	Deeply concerned that intermittent drought and heavy rains which caused river flooding and consequent severe devastation, coupled with the dire economic situation and persistent civil conflict, have seriously impaired the traditional coping mechanisms of the people in some parts of Somalia and have aggravated the increasingly fragile food security situation in the country, worsening the overall humanitarian situation,

	Welcoming the joint strategy for efficient and targeted assistance and the framework for collaboration developed and adopted by the United Nations and non-governmental organizations, and reaffirming the importance it attaches to the need for effective coordination and cooperation among the United Nations agencies and their partners,

	Deeply appreciative of the humanitarian assistance and rehabilitation support rendered by a number of States to alleviate the hardship and suffering of the affected Somali population,

	Recognizing that, while the humanitarian situation remains fragile in some parts, there is a need to continue the ongoing rehabilitation and reconstruction process alongside the national reconciliation process, without prejudice to the provision of emergency relief assistance wherever and whenever required, as security allows,

	Noting with appreciation the efforts of the United Nations system aimed at working directly with Somali communities, whenever possible, in the absence of a recognized national government, and welcoming the continuing focus of the United Nations, in partnership with Somali elders, other local leaders and skilled local counterparts at the grass-roots level, as well as non-governmental organizations, on a programme of assistance combining humanitarian and developmental approaches, given the varying conditions in different areas,

Also welcomes the strategy of the United Nations focusing on the implementation of community-based interventions aimed at rebuilding local infrastructures and increasing the self-reliance of the local population, and the ongoing efforts by the United Nations agencies, their Somali counterparts and their partner organizations to establish and maintain close coordination and cooperation mechanisms available for the implementation of relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction programmes;

	5.	Emphasizes the principle that the Somali people, in particular at the local level, have the primary responsibility for their own development and for the sustainability of rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance programmes, and reaffirms the importance it attaches to the creation of workable arrangements for collaboration between the United Nations system and its partner organizations and their Somali counterparts for the effective execution of rehabilitation and development activities in those parts of the country where peace and security prevail;

	6.	Urges all States and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations concerned to continue the further implementation of its resolution 47/160 so as to assist the Somali people to embark on the rehabilitation of basic social and economic services, as well as institution-building aimed at the restoration of civil administration at the local level in all those parts of the country where peace and security prevail;

	7.	Appeals to all States and relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to provide emergency disaster relief assistance, including food, medical and shelter supplies, as well as logistical support facilities to reach the segment of the population affected by the recent severe floods, to rescue those stranded by water and to curb the impact of potential health and economic consequences;

	8.	Also appeals to all the Somali parties concerned to seek peaceful means for resolving differences and to redouble their efforts to achieve national reconciliation that allows for transition from relief to reconstruction and development;

	9.	Calls upon all parties, movements and factions in Somalia to respect fully the security and safety of personnel of the United Nations and its specialized agencies and of non-governmental organizations, and to guarantee their complete freedom of movement throughout the country;

	10.	Calls upon the Secretary-General to continue to mobilize international humanitarian, rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance for Somalia;

	11.	Calls upon the international community to provide continuing and increased assistance in response to the United Nations Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction assistance for Somalia covering the period from October 1997 to December 1998;

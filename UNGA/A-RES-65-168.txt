[on the report of the Second Committee (A/65/438/Add.1)]
65/168.	Role of the United Nations in promoting development in the context of globalization and interdependence


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 62/199 of 19 December 2007, 63/222 of 19 December 2008 and 64/210 of 21 December 2009 on the role of the United Nations in promoting development in the context of globalization and interdependence,
	Recalling also the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development1 and the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development: outcome document of the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus,2 
	Recalling further its resolution 63/303 of 9 July 2009 entitled "Outcome of the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development",
	Recalling the outcome document of the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals,3 
	Recalling also its resolution 63/199 of 19 December 2008, in which it took note with interest of the adoption of the International Labour Organization Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization,4 
	Recalling further the 2005 World Summit Outcome5 and all its relevant resolutions in the economic, social and related fields, in particular those that have built upon the 2005 World Summit Outcome, including its resolution 60/265 of 30 June 2006 entitled "Follow-up to the development outcome of the 2005 World Summit, including the Millennium Development Goals and the other internationally agreed development goals", 
	Reaffirming the central role of the United Nations in promoting international cooperation for development and policy coherence on global development issues, including in the context of globalization and interdependence, 
	Reaffirming also the resolve expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for all,6
	Recognizing that globalization and interdependence imply that the economic performance of a country is increasingly affected by factors outside its geographical borders and that maximizing in an equitable manner the benefits of globalization requires responses to globalization to be developed through a strengthened global partnership for development to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, 
	Reaffirming its strong support for fair and inclusive globalization and the need to translate growth into poverty reduction and, in this regard, its resolve to make the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all, including for women and young people, a central objective of relevant national and international policies as well as national development strategies, including poverty reduction strategies, as part of efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, 
	1.	Recognizes that some countries have successfully adapted to the changes and have benefited from globalization but that many others, especially the least developed countries, have remained marginalized in the globalizing world economy, and recognizes also that, as stated in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,6 the benefits are unevenly shared, while the costs are unevenly distributed;
	2.	Reaffirms the need for the United Nations to play a fundamental role in the promotion of international cooperation for development and the coherence, coordination and implementation of development goals and actions agreed upon by the international community, and resolves to strengthen coordination within the United Nations system in close cooperation with all other multilateral financial, trade and development institutions in order to support sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and sustainable development;
	3.	Recognizes that the scaling up of successful strategies, policies and approaches in the implementation and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals needs to be complemented by a strengthened global partnership for development;
	4.	Reaffirms the need to strengthen the central role of the United Nations in enhancing the global partnership for development, with a view to creating a supportive global environment for the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, including by accelerating efforts to deliver and fully implement existing global partnership for development commitments;
	5.	Stresses that subregional, regional and interregional cooperation plays an important role in helping developing countries to integrate into the global economy and to achieve their development objectives and the Millennium Development Goals as well as in promoting the global partnership for development;
	6.	Recognizes that the increasing interdependence of national economies in a globalizing world and the emergence of rules-based regimes for international economic relations have meant that the space for national economic policy, that is, the scope for domestic policies, especially in the areas of trade, investment and international development, is now often framed by international disciplines, commitments and global market considerations and that it is for each Government to evaluate the trade-off between the benefits of accepting international rules and commitments and the constraints posed by the loss of policy space;
	7.	Notes with concern the continuing high levels of unemployment as a consequence of the global financial and economic crisis, recognizes that decent work remains one of the best routes out of poverty, and in this regard invites donor countries, multilateral organizations and other development partners to continue to assist Member States, in particular developing countries, in adopting policies consistent with the Global Jobs Pact adopted by the International Labour Conference at its ninety-eighth session, as a general framework within which each country can formulate policy packages specific to its situation and national priorities in order to promote a job-intensive recovery and sustainable development;
	8.	Recognizes that policies which link economic development and social development can contribute to reducing inequalities within and among countries with a view to guaranteeing that the poor and those living in the most vulnerable situations maximize their benefits from economic growth and development;
	9.	Underlines the fact that, in addressing the linkages between globalization and sustainable development, a particular focus should be placed on identifying and implementing mutually reinforcing policies and practices that promote sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development and that this may benefit from efforts to improve policy coherence for development at the national, regional and international levels; 
	10.	Stresses the need for all countries to harness knowledge and technology and to stimulate innovation if they are to improve their competitiveness, benefit from trade and investment and promote sustainable development, and in this regard underlines the importance of concrete actions to promote the development and dissemination of appropriate, affordable and sustainable technologies and the transfer of such technologies on fair, transparent and mutually agreed terms to developing countries in support of the implementation of their development strategies;
	11.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session a report on the theme "Globalization and interdependence: sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth for a fair and more equitable globalization for all, including job creation";
	12.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-sixth session, under the item entitled "Globalization and interdependence", the sub-item entitled "Role of the United Nations in promoting development in the context of globalization and interdependence".

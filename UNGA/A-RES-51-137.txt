Fifty-first session
Agenda item 86


	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Special Political and Decolonization Committee
	(Fourth Committee)(A/51/593 and Corr.1)]


51/137.Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 49/59 of 9 December 1994, by which it adopted the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel,

	Gravely concerned by the continuing attacks and acts of violence against United Nations and associated personnel that have caused death or serious injury,

	Conscious of the need effectively to promote and protect the safety and security of the personnel who act on behalf of the United Nations, attacks against whom are unjustifiable and unacceptable,

	Recognizing that United Nations and associated personnel, while carrying out their activities in support of the fulfilment of the mandate of a United Nations operation, are acting in the common interests of the international community,

	Considering that the entry into force of the Convention would strengthen arrangements for the protection of personnel who act on behalf of the United Nations,

	Noting, however, that only a small number of States have become parties to the Convention,


	Recalling the report of the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations,1 in which, in particular, the Committee called upon Member States to ratify the Convention so as to ensure its early entry into force,

	1.	Welcomes all signatures, ratifications, acceptances and approvals of the Convention on the Safety of United Nations and Associated Personnel and accessions thereto;

	2.	Urges all States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to the Convention, to bring about its entry into force at the earliest possible date;

	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to take the necessary steps to facilitate the dissemination of information relating to the Convention and to promote its wider appreciation;

	4.	Also requests the Secretary-General to inform the General Assembly at its fifty-third session on the status of the Convention and on the steps taken pursuant to paragraph 3 above.

	83rd plenary meeting
	13 December 1996
     1 A/51/130 and Corr.1.

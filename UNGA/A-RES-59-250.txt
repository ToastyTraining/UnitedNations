	9.	Decides that, with the agreement of the host country, the United Nations development system should assist national Governments in creating an enabling environment in which the links between national Governments, the United Nations development system, civil society, national non-governmental organizations and the private sector that are involved in the development process are strengthened, with a view to seeking new and innovative solutions to development problems in accordance with national policies and priorities;
	10.

Urges developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete efforts to reach the targets of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product as official development assistance to developing countries and 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of their gross national product to least developed countries, as reconfirmed at the Third United Nations Conference on Least Developed Countries, held in Brussels from 14 to 20 May 2001,4 encourages developing countries to build on progress achieved in ensuring that official development assistance is used effectively to help to achieve development goals and targets, acknowledges the efforts of all donors, commends those donors whose official development assistance contributions exceed, reach or are increasing towards the targets, and underlines the importance of undertaking to examine the means and time frames for achieving the targets and goals;5
	20.	Notes the increase in non-core resources as a mechanism to supplement the means of operational activities for development of the United Nations system, which contributes to an increase in total resources, while recognizing that non-core resources are not a substitute for core resources and that unearmarked contributions are vital for the coherence and harmonization of the operational activities for development;
	21.	Invites the governing bodies of all organizations of the United Nations development system to address systematically the funding of their operational activities and to explore, within the context of their multi-year planning and related financial frameworks, where appropriate, additional sources of financial support and alternative funding modalities so as to secure, on a predictable, continuous and sustained basis, the critical mass of resources required to ensure adequate functioning and pursuit of long-term development objectives;

	43.	Recognizes that, in spite of these efforts, participation of the funds, programmes and agencies of the United Nations development system in country-level operational activities for development and coordination mechanisms still differs in level, quality and intensity, and that for some organizations it is inadequate, and in this context calls upon the United Nations development system to improve its country-level coordination so as to optimize its support to national development efforts, at the request of national authorities;

	46.	Stresses the importance of the common country assessment as the common analytical tool of the United Nations system at the country level, including the specialized agencies, the regional commissions and other United Nations agencies with no country representation or limited country-level presence, which should contribute their accumulated analytical and normative experience so as to enable the use of all capacities available within the United Nations system;

	57.	Reaffirms that the utilization of advanced information and communication technologies by the United Nations system could contribute to enhanced information-sharing and knowledge management, resulting in more effective delivery of development cooperation by the United Nations system, and encourages United Nations organizations to intensify their efforts to expand the use of information and communication technologies and to further harmonize their information technology platforms;

	59.	Underscores the fact that the resident coordinator system is owned by the United Nations development system as a whole and that its functioning should be participatory, collegial and accountable; 
	60.	Also underscores the fact that the management of the resident coordinator system continues to be firmly anchored in the United Nations Development Programme, while recognizing that many resident coordinators, especially in countries with large country teams, complex coordination situations or in situations of complex emergencies, lack the capacity to address equally well all tasks inherent to their functions, and in this regard requests that in such cases the United Nations Development Programme appoint, within the existing programming arrangement, a country director to run its core activities, including fund-raising, so as to assure that resident coordinators are fully available for their tasks;

	64.	Stresses the principle that no core function of the Secretariat can be outsourced to operational bodies, in particular at the field level, without proper financial compensation;
	65.	Invites the governing bodies of the organizations of the United Nations development system to consider means to strengthen their country-level capacities, including through complementary measures at their headquarters; 

VII
Evaluation of operational activities for development
	66.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to assess the effectiveness of the operational activities for development of the United Nations system, including, in particular, by assessing the effective use of all capacities available to provide a comprehensive and flexible response to the demand of developing countries for development support, and to report on the results of this assessment in the context of the next triennial policy review at its sixty-second session;
	67.	Reaffirms that the effectiveness of operational activities should be assessed by their impact on the poverty eradication efforts, economic growth and sustainable development of recipient countries; 
	68.

	73.	Also requests the United Nations development system to consider, where appropriate, applying lessons learned in the course of monitoring and evaluation to programming processes; 
	74.	Stresses the need for all organizations of the United Nations development system to implement their global, regional and country-level activities in accordance with their mandates and the priorities of the recipient countries, urges their governing bodies to ensure that the activities, responsibilities and operational strategies of each fund and programme are consistent with their mandates and the overall policy guidance set forth by the General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council and to report on these issues within the context of the annual reports submitted to the Council, and requests the Secretary-General to include an assessment of these issues in the report on the triennial comprehensive policy review prepared for the sixty-second session of the General Assembly;

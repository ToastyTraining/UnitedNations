	Taking note also of the reports of the Special Rapporteurs of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, in which they describe the situation in Kosovo, the various discriminatory measures taken in the legislative, administrative and judicial areas, acts of violence and arbitrary arrests perpetrated against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and the continuing deterioration of the human rights situation in Kosovo, including:

	(a)	Police brutality against ethnic Albanians, the killing of ethnic Albanians resulting from such violence, arbitrary searches, seizures and arrests, forced evictions, torture and ill-treatment of detainees and discrimination in the administration of justice, including the recent trials of ethnic Albanian former policemen;

	(b)	Discriminatory and arbitrary dismissals of ethnic Albanian civil servants, notably from the ranks of the police and the judiciary, mass dismissals of ethnic Albanians, confiscation and expropriation of their properties, discrimination against ethnic Albanian pupils and teachers, the closing of Albanian-language secondary schools and the university, as well as the closing of all Albanian cultural and scientific institutions;

	(c)	The harassment and persecution of political parties and associations of ethnic Albanians and their leaders and activities, their maltreatment and imprisonment;

	3.	Urgently demands that the authorities of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro):

	(a)	Take all necessary measures to bring to an immediate end all human rights violations against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo, including, in particular, the discriminatory measures and practices, arbitrary searches and detention, the violation of the right to a fair trial and the practice of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and to revoke all discriminatory legislation, in particular that which has entered into force since 1989;

	(b)	Release all political prisoners and cease the persecution of political leaders and members of local human rights organizations;

	(c)	Allow the establishment of genuine democratic institutions in Kosovo, including the parliament and the judiciary, and respect the will of its inhabitants as the best means of preventing the escalation of the conflict there;

	5.	Encourages the Secretary-General to pursue his humanitarian efforts in the former Yugoslavia, in liaison with the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Children's Fund and other appropriate humanitarian organizations, with a view to taking urgent practical steps to tackle the critical needs of the people in Kosovo, especially of the most vulnerable groups affected by the conflict, and to assist in the voluntary return of displaced persons to their homes;

	10.	Calls upon the Special Rapporteur to continue to monitor closely the situation of human rights in Kosovo and to continue to pay due attention to this matter in her reporting;

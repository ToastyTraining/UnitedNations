Resolution adopted by the General Assembly

[on the report of the Second Committee (A/55/579/Add.1)]
55/181.	Transit environment in the landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours
	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 48/169 and 48/170 of 21 December 1993, 49/102 of 19 December 1994, 51/168 of 16 December 1996, 53/171 of 15 December 1998 and  55/2 of 8 September 2000,
	Recalling also the Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation between Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries and the Donor Community1 and other relevant international legal instruments,
	Recognizing that the overall socio-economic development efforts of the landlocked States in Central Asia, seeking to enter world markets through the establishment of a multicountry transit system, are impeded by a lack of territorial access to the sea and by remoteness and isolation from world markets as well as by a lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector in their transit developing neighbours owing to their economic problems,
	Reaffirming that transit States, in the exercise of full sovereignty over their territory, have the right to take all measures necessary to ensure that the rights and facilities provided for landlocked States in no way infringe upon their legitimate interests,
	Expressing its support for the current efforts being undertaken by the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours, through relevant multilateral, bilateral and regional arrangements, to address issues regarding the development of a viable transit infrastructure in the region,
	Taking note of the report prepared by the secretariat of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development on the transit environment in the landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours,2 and considering that the problems of transit transport facing the Central Asian region need to be seen against the backdrop of increased trade and capital flows and advancement in technology in the region,
	Recognizing that, to be effective, a transit transport strategy for the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours should incorporate actions that address both the problems inherent in the use of existing transit routes and those associated with the early development and smooth functioning of new alternative routes, and welcoming in this context the further cooperation of landlocked States with all interested countries,
	Noting that there have been a number of important developments at the subregional and regional levels, including the signing at Almaty, Kazakhstan, on 9 May 1998, of a transit transport framework agreement among States members of the Economic Cooperation Organization, the signing on 26 March 1998 by the heads of State of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the Economic Commission for Europe and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific of the Tashkent Declaration on the United Nations Special Programme for the Economies of Central Asia,3 the implementation of the expanded Transport Corridor-Europe-Caucasus-Asia programme and the signing on 8 September 1998 of the Baku Declaration,4
	Welcoming the presentation of the United Nations Special Programme for the Economies of Central Asia, held at Almaty, Kazakhstan, on 27 April 2000, the adoption of the concept of the Special Programme and the joint statement by the Governments of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, the Economic Commission for Europe and the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific,
	Emphasizing once again the importance of strengthening international support measures to address further the problems of the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours,
	1.	Notes with appreciation the contribution of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to improving the efficiency of the transit transport system in the landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours;
	2.	Invites the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Governments concerned, in cooperation with the United Nations Development Programme, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the Economic Commission for Europe and relevant regional and international organizations and in accordance with approved programme priorities and within existing financial resources, to continue to elaborate a programme for improving the efficiency of the current transit environment in the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours;
	3.	Invites the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in close cooperation with the regional commissions within their respective mandates and current resources, as well as with other relevant international organizations, to provide technical assistance and advisory services to the newly independent landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours, taking into account the relevant transit transport agreements;
	4.	Invites donor countries and multilateral financial and development institutions, within their mandates, to continue to provide the newly independent and developing landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours with appropriate financial and technical assistance for the improvement of the transit environment, including construction, maintenance and improvement of their transport, storage and other transit-related facilities and improved communications;
	5.	Calls upon the United Nations system to continue to study, within the scope of the implementation of the present resolution, possible ways of promoting more cooperative arrangements between the landlocked States in Central Asia and their transit developing neighbours, and to encourage a more active supportive role on the part of the donor community;
	6.	Requests the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in close cooperation with the regional commissions, to prepare a report on the implementation of the present resolution, to be submitted to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session.

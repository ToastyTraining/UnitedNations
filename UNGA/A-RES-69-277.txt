Political declaration on strengthening cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations
	We, high-level representatives of Member States and observers meeting in New York on 4 May 2015, declare that the high-level thematic debate on strengthening cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations constitutes an important opportunity to further build upon and enhance the strategic partnership between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations. We therefore:

	2.	Underscore the important role that regional and subregional organizations play, in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, in the areas of peace and security, development and human rights, and recognize that these organizations are well positioned to understand the challenges and dynamics facing their respective regions given their geographic, cultural and historical proximity, as well as information about specific local and conflict situations within their mandates, and contribute to the prevention and resolution of such conflicts;
	3.	Also underscore that the cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations has evolved over the years and that strengthening these partnerships is strategic for promoting the principles of comparative advantage and complementarity;
	4.	Reaffirm our determination and commitment to support efforts to strengthen cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations in addressing challenges facing their respective regions and the international community, and recognize that fostering cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations is a common and shared objective requiring an integrated approach in full conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter and international law;
	5.	Encourage all Member States to promote and support the strengthening of cooperation between the United Nations and regional and subregional organizations given the magnitude and complexity of challenges facing the international community and, inter alia, galvanize international support towards building the capacities of regional and subregional organizations in conflict prevention and resolution, including mediation and reconciliation, peacekeeping in accordance with the purposes and principles of the Charter and the basic principles of peacekeeping operations, and peacebuilding;
	6.	Reiterate that regional and subregional organizations have the responsibility to secure human, financial, logistical and other resources for their organizations, including through contributions by their members and support from partners, and welcome the valuable financial support provided by partners in this regard;
	7.	Recognize that, in cases when regional or subregional organizations deploy peacekeeping operations authorized by the Security Council, they contribute towards the maintenance of international peace and security, consistent with the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter, and stress the need to enhance the predictability, sustainability and flexibility of financing regional organizations when they undertake peacekeeping under a Council mandate;
	8.	Encourage the United Nations, in cooperation with regional and subregional organizations, to enhance partnership and support efforts to combat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations as well as to counter violent extremism, and reiterate strong condemnation of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, committed by whomever, wherever and for whatever purposes, as it constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security;
	9.	Reaffirm that regional and subregional organizations, as well as the United Nations regional commissions and their subregional offices, have a significant role to play in promoting balanced integration of the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development in their respective regions, and in this regard encourage increased cooperation among regional and subregional organizations, including in the areas of technical assistance, capacity-building and information-sharing;
	10.	Also reaffirm our commitment to strengthen international cooperation to address the persistent challenges related to sustainable development, by eradicating poverty in all its dimensions, ending hunger, achieving sustained and inclusive economic growth, and promoting social equity, equality and environmental sustainability, in the context of the post-2015 development agenda, and underscore the need to support regional and subregional organizations, including through the United Nations system, in the effective operationalization and implementation of sustainable development;

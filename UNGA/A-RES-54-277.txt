	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/54/908)]


54/277.	Financing of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic

    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

    Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 1159 (1998) of 27 March 1998, by which the Council decided to establish the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Mission, the latest of which was resolution 1271 (1999) of 22 October 1999, 

    Recalling its resolution 52/249 of 26 June 1998 on the financing of the Mission and its subsequent resolutions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 53/238 of 8 June 1999,

    Reaffirming that the costs of the Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

    Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,


    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Mission,

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the account of the Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to meet its outstanding liabilities,

    1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic as at 30 April 2000, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 36.6 million United States dollars, representing 32 per cent of the total assessed contributions, notes that some 41 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

    2.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

    3.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursements to troop contributors that bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

    4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Mission in full and on time;

    5.	Expresses concern at the delay experienced by the Secretary-General in deploying and providing adequate resources to some recent peacekeeping missions, in particular those in Africa;

    6.	Emphasizes that all future and existing peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements;

    7.	Also emphasizes that all peacekeeping missions shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates; 

    8.	Endorses the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2 and requests the Secretary-General to ensure their full implementation;

    9.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the liquidation of the Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;


    10.	Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic the amount of 7,730,200 dollars gross (7,496,600 dollars net) for the maintenance and liquidation of the Mission for the period ending 30 June 2000, in addition to the amount of 33,367,875 dollars gross (32,572,675 dollars net) already appropriated under the terms of General Assembly resolution 53/238 and inclusive of an amount of 6,701,900 dollars gross and net authorized by the Advisory Committee under the terms of section IV of Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994;

    11.	Decides also, as an ad hoc arrangement, taking into account the amount of 33,367,875 dollars gross (32,572,675 dollars net) already apportioned under the terms of its resolution 53/238, to apportion among Member States the additional amount of 7,730,200 dollars gross (7,496,600 dollars net) for the period ending 30 June 2000, in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996, 51/218 A to C of 18 December 1996 and 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993, 50/451 B of 23 December 1995 and 54/456 to 54/458 of 23 December 1999, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the year 2000, as set out in its resolutions 52/215 A of 22 December 1997 and 54/237 A of 23 December 1999;

    14.	Decides also that, for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission, there shall be set off against their apportionment, as provided for in paragraph 11 above, their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 3,193,900 dollars gross (3,238,500 dollars net) in respect of the period ending 30 June 1999;

    16.	Emphasizes that no peacekeeping mission shall be financed by borrowing funds from other active peacekeeping missions;

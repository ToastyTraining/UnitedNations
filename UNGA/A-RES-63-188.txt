Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 18 December 2008
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/63/430/Add.2)]
63/188.	Respect for the right to universal freedom of travel and the vital importance of family reunification


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 61/162 of 19 December 2006,
	Reaffirming that all human rights and fundamental freedoms are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,
	Recalling the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 as well as article 12 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,2
	Stressing that, as stated in the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development,3 family reunification of documented migrants is an important factor in international migration and that remittances by documented migrants to their countries of origin often constitute a very important source of foreign exchange and are instrumental in improving the well-being of relatives left behind,
	Noting with great concern that, while some positive developments have occurred during the past few years in the accomplishment of the objectives highlighted in previous resolutions adopted by the General Assembly on this matter,4 in particular relating to facilitating the flow of remittances across international borders to help families, in certain cases it has been reported that measures have been adopted that increased the restrictions imposed on documented migrants in relation to family reunification and the possibility of sending remittances to their relatives in the country of origin,
	Recalling that the family is the basic unit of society and, as such, should be strengthened, and that it is entitled to receive comprehensive protection and support,
	1.	Once again calls upon all States to guarantee the universally recognized freedom of travel to all foreign nationals legally residing in their territory;
	2.	Reaffirms that all Governments, in particular those of receiving countries, must recognize the vital importance of family reunification and promote its incorporation into national legislation in order to ensure protection of the unity of families of documented migrants;
	3.	Calls upon all States to allow, in conformity with international legislation, the free flow of financial remittances by foreign nationals residing in their territory to relatives in the country of origin;
	4.	Also calls upon all States to refrain from enacting, and to repeal if it already exists, legislation intended as a coercive measure that discriminates against individuals or groups of legal migrants by adversely affecting family reunification and the right to send financial remittances to relatives in the country of origin;
	5.	Decides to continue its consideration of the question at its sixty-fifth session under the item entitled "Promotion and protection of human rights".

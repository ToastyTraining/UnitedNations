52/21.Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 50/13 of 7 November 1995, in which it decided to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-second session the item entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal" and to consider this item every two years in advance of each Summer and Winter Olympic Games,

	Recalling also its resolution 48/11 of 25 October 1993, which, inter alia, revived the ancient Greek tradition of ekecheiria or "Olympic Truce", calling for all hostilities to cease during the Games, thereby mobilizing the youth of the world in the cause of peace,

	Recognizing the valuable contribution that the appeal launched by the International Olympic Committee for an Olympic Truce, with which the National Olympic Committees of the Member States are associated, could make towards advancing the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Taking into account resolution CM/Res.1608 (LXII), adopted by the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity at its sixty-second ordinary session, held at Addis Ababa from 21 to 23 June 1995,1 and endorsed by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of that organization, which supports the appeal for an Olympic Truce,

	Reaffirming that the Olympic ideal promotes international understanding, particularly among the youth of the world, through sport and culture in order to advance the harmonious development of humankind,

	Noting with satisfaction the increasing number of joint endeavours of the International Olympic Committee and the United Nations system, for example in the fields of development, humanitarian assistance, protection of the environment, health promotion and education, in which the United Nations Development Programme, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the United Nations Environment Programme, the World Health Organization and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization have participated,


	1.	Urges Member States to observe the Olympic Truce during the XVIII Olympic Winter Games, which will be held in Nagano, Japan, from 7 to 22 February 1998, the vision of which is to be a link to the twenty-first century, inspiring the search for wisdom for the new era, respect for the beauty and bounty of nature and the furtherance of peace and goodwill;

	2.	Takes note of the idea of the Olympic Truce, as dedicated in ancient Greece to the spirit of fraternity and understanding between peoples, and urges Member States to take the initiative to abide by the Olympic Truce, individually and collectively, and to pursue in conformity with the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations the peaceful settlement of all international conflicts;

	3.	Calls upon all Member States to cooperate with the International Olympic Committee in its efforts to promote the Olympic Truce;

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to promote the observance of the Olympic Truce among Member States, drawing the attention of world public opinion to the contribution such a truce would make to the promotion of international understanding and the preservation of peace and goodwill, and to cooperate with the International Olympic Committee in the realization of this objective;

	5.	Welcomes the decision of the International Olympic Committee to fly the United Nations flag at all competition sites of the Olympic Games;

	6.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-fourth session the item entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal" and to consider this item before the Games of the XXVII Olympiad in Sydney, Australia, in the year 2000.

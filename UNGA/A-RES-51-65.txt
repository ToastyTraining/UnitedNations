	Noting the large numbers of women from developing countries and from some countries with economies in transition who continue to venture forth to more affluent countries in search of a living for themselves and their families as a consequence of, inter alia, poverty, unemployment and other socio-economic conditions, and acknowledging the duty of sending States to work for conditions that provide employment and security to their citizens,

	Acknowledging the economic benefits that accrue to sending and receiving States from the employment of women migrant workers,

	Emphasizing the need for accurate, objective and comprehensive information and data as a basis for policy formulation,

	Concerned by the continuing reports of grave abuses and acts of violence committed against the persons of women migrant workers by some employers in some host countries,

	Encouraged by measures adopted by some receiving States to alleviate the plight of women migrant workers residing within their areas of jurisdiction,

	4.	Also encourages Member States to adopt and/or implement and periodically to review and analyse legislation to ensure its effectiveness in eliminating violence against women, emphasizing the prevention of violence and the prosecution of offenders, and to take measures to ensure the protection of women subjected to violence and their access to just and effective remedies, including compensation and indemnification and healing of victims, and for the rehabilitation of perpetrators;

	5.	Invites Member States concerned, specifically the sending and receiving States, to consider adopting appropriate legal measures against intermediaries who deliberately encourage the clandestine movement of workers and who exploit women migrant workers;

	6.	Reiterates the need for States concerned, specifically the sending and receiving States of women migrant workers, to conduct regular consultations for the purpose of identifying problem areas in promoting and protecting the rights of women migrant workers and ensuring health, legal and social services for them, adopting specific measures to address those problems, setting up, as necessary, linguistically and culturally accessible services and mechanisms to implement those measures and, in general, creating conditions that foster greater harmony and tolerance between women migrant workers and the rest of the society in which they reside;

	7.	Encourages Member States to consider signing and ratifying or acceding to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families,8 as well as the Slavery Convention of 1926;9 

	8.	Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the Centre for Human Rights of the Secretariat and the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on violence against women, its causes and consequences, as well as all relevant bodies and programmes in the United Nations system, when addressing the issue of violence against women, to give particular attention to the issue of violence perpetrated against women migrant workers;

	The General Assembly,
	Guided by the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1
	Recalling the 2005 World Summit Outcome,2 particularly its recognition that all individuals, in particular vulnerable people, are entitled to freedom from fear and freedom from want, with an equal opportunity to enjoy all their rights and fully develop their human potential,
	Recalling also its resolution 59/137 of 10 December 2004, in which it requested the Secretary-General to encourage relevant agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system to continue to work with the Government of Rwanda to develop and implement programmes aimed at supporting vulnerable groups that continue to suffer from the effects of the 1994 genocide,
	Recalling further the findings and recommendations of the independent inquiry commissioned by the Secretary-General, with the approval of the Security Council, into the actions of the United Nations during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda,3
	Recalling the report containing the findings and recommendations of the International Panel of Eminent Personalities commissioned by the Organization of African Unity to investigate the genocide in Rwanda and the surrounding events, entitled "Rwanda: The Preventable Genocide",

	Recognizing the numerous difficulties faced by survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, particularly the orphans, widows and victims of sexual violence, who are poorer and more vulnerable as a result of the genocide, especially the many victims of sexual violence who have contracted HIV and have since either died or become seriously ill with AIDS,
	Firmly convinced of the necessity to restore the dignity of the survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, which would help to promote reconciliation and healing in Rwanda,
	Commending the tremendous efforts of the Government and people of Rwanda and civil society organizations, as well as international efforts, to provide support for restoring the dignity of the survivors, including the allocation by the Government of Rwanda of 5 per cent of its national budget every year to support genocide survivors,
	1.	Requests the Secretary-General to encourage the relevant agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system to implement resolution 59/137 expeditiously;
	2.	Encourages all Member States to provide assistance to genocide survivors and other vulnerable groups in Rwanda in support of the present resolution;

	4.	Urges Member States to develop educational programmes that will inculcate future generations with the lessons of the genocide in Rwanda in order to help to prevent future acts of genocide;
	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to establish a programme of outreach entitled "The Rwanda Genocide and the United Nations" as well as measures to mobilize civil society for Rwanda genocide victim remembrance and education, in order to help to prevent future acts of genocide, and to report to the General Assembly on the establishment of the programme within six months from the date of the adoption of the present resolution;
	6.	Also requests the Secretary-General, in view of the critical situation of the survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, particularly orphans, widows and victims of sexual violence, to take all necessary and practicable measures for the implementation of the present resolution and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its sixty-second session;
	7.	Requests the General Committee to consider including in the provisional agenda of the General Assembly at its sixty-second session an additional item entitled "Assistance to survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, particularly orphans, widows and victims of sexual violence".

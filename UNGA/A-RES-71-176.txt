71/176.	Protecting children from bullying


	The General Assembly, 
	Recalling its resolution 69/158 of 18 December 2014 on protecting children from bullying, all its previous resolutions on the rights of the child and the resolutions adopted by the Human Rights Council that are relevant to the protection of children from bullying, 
	Emphasizing that the Convention on the Rights of the Child1 constitutes the standard in the promotion and protection of the rights of the child and that States parties to the Convention shall undertake all appropriate legislative, administrative and other measures for the implementation of the rights recognized therein, 
	Recalling the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights Education and Training,2 and noting the adoption of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Declaration of Principles on Tolerance,3 
	Welcoming the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in its entirety,4 including goals and targets aimed at ending abuse, exploitation, trafficking and all forms of violence against and torture of children contained therein, and underscoring the importance of its implementation for ensuring the enjoyment of the rights of the child, 
	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,5 including, in particular, the conclusions and recommendations contained therein,
	Noting with appreciation the establishment of the Global Partnership to End Violence against Children and the "High time to end violence against children" initiative of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Violence against Children, and noting that they constitute platforms for multi-stakeholder engagement that can contribute to the prevention and elimination of violence against children, including forms of bullying, 
	Recognizing that bullying, including cyberbullying, can take both direct and indirect forms, from acts of violence and aggression to social exclusion, and that, although rates differ from country to country, bullying, online or in person, can have a negative impact on the rights of the child and is among children's main concerns, affecting a high percentage of children and compromising their health, emotional well-being and academic work, and acknowledging the need to prevent and eliminate bullying among children, 
	Recognizing also the importance of generating appropriate statistical information on bullying, 
	Concerned about the occurrence of bullying in different parts of the world and the fact that children who are victimized by such practices may be at heightened risk for a wide range of emotional problems, as well as potential long-term effects on the individual's ability to realize his or her own potential, 
	Concerned also that bullying is associated with long-lasting consequences that continue on into adulthood, 
	Noting with concern that children who are marginalized or vulnerable, who face stigmatization, discrimination or exclusion, are disproportionately affected by bullying, both in person and online, 
	Recognizing that bullying often includes a gender dimension and is associated with gender-based violence and stereotyping that negatively affects both boys and girls, 
	Noting the risks associated with the misuse of new information and communications technologies and applications, including increased vulnerability to bullying, while stressing that they can create new ways to enhance education and, inter alia, learn and teach about the rights of the child and can be useful tools to promote children's protection, 
	Noting also the role that information and communications technologies play in reducing the risk of sexual abuse and exploitation, including by empowering children to report such abuses, 
	Acknowledging the obligations and commitments of States to take all appropriate legislative, administrative, social and educational measures to protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, and, as appropriate, the implementation of educational measures to address behavioural practices that condone such violence, 
	Acknowledging also that the environments surrounding children can affect their behaviour and the important roles that parents, legal guardians, family members, schools, civil society, communities, State institutions and the media have in securing children's protection from the risks associated with bullying and in preventing all forms of violence against children, 
	Stressing that children should grow up in a family environment and in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding, given the important role that family plays in this regard, and acknowledging that parents or, as the case may be, legal guardians, have the primary responsibility for the upbringing and development of the child, 
	Recognizing that evidence-based initiatives to strengthen children's life skills and respect for human rights, tolerance, concern for others and the responsibility to foster safety, as well as whole-school and whole-community programmes that fully respect all human rights, constitute best practices that should be developed, strengthened and shared through international cooperation, 
	Acknowledging that children's participation and their contributions need to be at the centre of efforts to prevent and address bullying, 
	1.	Calls upon Member States:

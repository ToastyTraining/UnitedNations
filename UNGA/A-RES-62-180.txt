	The General Assembly,
	Recalling that the period 2001-2010 has been proclaimed the Decade to Roll Back Malaria in Developing Countries, Particularly in Africa, by the General Assembly,1 and that combating HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and other diseases is included in the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,2

	10.	Calls upon the international community, inter alia, by helping to meet the financial needs of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria and through country-led initiatives with adequate international support, to intensify access to affordable, safe and effective antimalarial combination treatments, intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancies, long-lasting insecticide-treated mosquito nets, including through the free distribution of such nets where appropriate, and insecticides for indoor residual spraying for malaria control, taking into account relevant international rules, standards and guidelines;

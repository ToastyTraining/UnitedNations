	The General Assembly,
	Recalling all of its previous resolutions on violence against women migrant workers and those adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women, the Commission on Human Rights and the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, and the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women,1
	Reaffirming the provisions concerning women migrant workers contained in the outcome documents of the World Conference on Human Rights,2 the International Conference on Population and Development,3 the Fourth World Conference on Women4 and the World Summit for Social Development5 and their reviews,
	Noting with appreciation the various activities initiated by entities of the United Nations system, such as the Regional Programme on Empowering Women Migrant Workers in Asia of the United Nations Development Fund for Women, the high-level panel discussion on the gender dimensions of international migration held by the Commission on the Status of Women at its fiftieth session, the discussions held by the Commission at its fifty-third session, during which it recognized the particular situation of women migrant domestic workers of all ages, and the general discussion on migrant domestic workers held by the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families at its eleventh session, and noting the contribution of the International Labour Organization through the development of the Multilateral Framework on Labour Migration, as well as other activities through which the plight of women migrant workers continues to be assessed and alleviated,
	Recalling the discussions during the High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development, held on 14 and 15 September 2006, which recognized, inter alia, the need for special protection for migrant women,
	Taking note with appreciation of the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report 2009: Overcoming Barriers - Human Mobility and Development,6 which discussed, inter alia, the need to protect women migrant workers from abuse, exploitation and violence,
	Noting the decision of the Governing Body of the International Labour Office to include discussion of the issue of decent work for domestic workers in the agenda for the ninety-ninth session of the International Labour Conference in June 2010,
	Recognizing the increasing participation of women in international migration, driven in large part by socio-economic factors, and that this feminization of migration requires greater gender sensitivity in all policies and efforts related to the subject of international migration,
	Stressing the shared responsibility of all stakeholders, in particular countries of origin, transit and destination, relevant regional and international organizations, the private sector and civil society, in promoting an environment that prevents and addresses violence against women migrant workers, and in this regard recognizing the importance of joint and collaborative approaches and strategies at the national, bilateral, regional and international levels,
	Recognizing that women migrant workers are important contributors to social and economic development, and underlining the value and dignity of their labour, including the labour of domestic workers, 
	Acknowledging the contribution that women migrant workers make to development through the economic benefits that accrue to both the country of origin and the country of destination,
	Recognizing the particular vulnerability of women and their children at all stages of the migration process, extending from the moment of deciding to migrate, and including transit, engagement in formal and informal employment, and integration into the host society, as well as during their return to their countries of origin,
	Expressing deep concern at the continuing reports of grave abuses and violence committed against migrant women and girls, including gender-based violence, in particular sexual violence, trafficking, domestic and family violence, racist and xenophobic acts, abusive labour practices and exploitative conditions of work,
	Recognizing that the intersection of, inter alia, gender, age, class and ethnic discrimination and stereotypes can compound the discrimination faced by women migrant workers,
	Reaffirming the commitment to protect and promote the human rights of all women, including, without discrimination, indigenous women who migrate for work, and in this regard noting the attention paid in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples7 to the elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination against indigenous women, as appropriate,
	Concerned that many migrant women who are employed in the informal economy and in less skilled work are especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, underlining in this regard the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants so as to prevent abuse and exploitation, and observing with concern that many women migrant workers take on jobs for which they may be overqualified and in which, at the same time, they may be more vulnerable because of poor pay and inadequate social protection,
	Emphasizing the need for objective, comprehensive and broad-based information, including sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics, and gender-sensitive indicators for research and analysis, and a wide exchange of experience and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of policies and concrete strategies to address the problem of violence against women migrant workers,
	Realizing that the movement of a significant number of women migrant workers may be facilitated and made possible by means of fraudulent or irregular documentation and sham marriages with the object of migration, that this may be facilitated through, inter alia, the Internet, and that those women migrant workers are more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation,
	Recognizing the importance of exploring the link between migration and trafficking in order to further efforts towards protecting women migrant workers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse,
	Encouraged by some measures adopted by some countries of destination to alleviate the plight of women migrant workers residing in their areas of jurisdiction, such as the establishment of protection mechanisms for migrant workers, facilitating their access to mechanisms for reporting complaints, or providing assistance during legal proceedings,
	Underlining the important role of relevant United Nations treaty bodies in monitoring the implementation of human rights conventions and the relevant special procedures, within their respective mandates, in addressing the problem of violence against women migrant workers and in protecting and promoting their human rights and welfare,

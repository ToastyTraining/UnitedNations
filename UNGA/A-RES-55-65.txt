	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 52/92 of 12 December 1997, 53/115 of 9 December 1998 and 54/132 of 17 December 1999,
	Reaffirming its commitment to the outcome of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly devoted to countering the world drug problem together, held in New York from 8 to 10 June 1998, and welcoming the continued determination of Governments to overcome the world drug problem by a full and balanced application of national, regional and international strategies to reduce the demand for, production of and trafficking in illicit drugs, as reflected in the Political Declaration,1 the Action Plan2 for the Implementation of the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction3 and the measures to enhance international cooperation to counter the world drug problem,4
	Gravely concerned that, despite continued increased efforts by States, relevant international organizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, the drug problem is still a challenge of a global dimension, which constitutes a serious threat to the health, safety and well-being of all mankind, in particular young people, in all countries, undermines development, including efforts to reduce poverty, socio-economic and political stability and democratic institutions, entails an increasing economic cost for Governments, also threatens the national security and sovereignty of States, as well as the dignity and hope of millions of people and their families, and causes irreparable loss of human lives,
	Concerned that the demand for, production of and trafficking in illicit drugs and psychotropic substances continue to threaten seriously the socio-economic and political systems, stability, national security and sovereignty of many States, especially those involved in conflicts and wars, and that trafficking in drugs could make conflict resolution more difficult, 
	Deeply alarmed by the violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug-trafficking activities and other criminal activities, such as money-laundering and illicit traffic in arms, precursors and essential chemicals, and by the increasing transnational links between them, and recognizing the need for international cooperation and implementation of effective strategies on the basis of the outcome of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly, which are essential to achieving results against all forms of transnational criminal activities,
	Noting with grave concern the global increase in the use of minors in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, as well as in the number of children and young people starting to use drugs at an earlier age and in their access to substances not previously used, 
	Alarmed by the rapid and widespread increase in the illicit manufacture, trafficking and consumption, in particular by young people, of synthetic drugs in many countries and by the high probability that amphetamine-type stimulants, in particular methamphetamine and amphetamine, may become drugs of choice among abusers in the twenty-first century,
	Deeply convinced that the special session made a significant contribution to a new comprehensive framework for international cooperation, based on an integrated and balanced approach with strategies, measures, methods, practical activities, goals and specific targets to be met, that all States, the United Nations system and other international organizations must implement them with concrete actions and that the international financial institutions, such as the World Bank, and the regional development banks should be invited to include action against the world drug problem in their programmes, taking into account the priorities of States,
	Reaffirming the importance of the commitments of Member States in meeting the objectives targeted for 2003 and 2008, as set out in the Political Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its twentieth special session, and welcoming the guidelines for reporting on the follow-up to the twentieth special session adopted by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs at its reconvened forty-second session,5
	Emphasizing the importance of the Action Plan for the Implementation of the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction, which introduces a global approach, recognizing a new balance between illicit supply and demand reduction, under the principle of shared responsibility, aims at preventing the use of drugs and at reducing the adverse consequences of drug abuse, ensuring that special attention is paid to vulnerable groups, in particular children and young people, and constitutes one of the pillars of the new global strategy, and reaffirming the need for demand reduction programmes,
	Emphasizing equally the importance of supply reduction as an integral part of a balanced drug control strategy under the principles enshrined in the Action Plan on International Cooperation on the Eradication of Illicit Drug Crops and on Alternative Development,6 reaffirming the need for alternative development programmes that are sustainable, welcoming the achievements of some States on their way to eradicating illicit drug crops, and inviting all other States to make similar efforts,
	Underlining the role of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs as the principal United Nations policy-making body on drug control issues, the leadership role and commendable work of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the main focus for concerted multilateral action and the important role of the International Narcotics Control Board as an independent monitoring authority, as set out in the international drug control treaties,
	Recognizing the efforts of all countries, in particular those that produce narcotic drugs for scientific and medical purposes, and of the International Narcotics Control Board in preventing the diversion of such substances to illicit markets and in maintaining production at a level consistent with licit demand, in line with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of l9617 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971,8
	Recognizing also that the problem of the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances is often related to development problems and that those links and the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade require, within the context of shared responsibility, appropriate measures, including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities, in the affected areas of those countries, that have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production,
	Stressing that respect for all human rights is and must be an essential component of measures taken to address the drug problem,
	Ensuring that women and men benefit equally, and without any discrimination, from strategies directed against the world drug problem, through their involvement in all stages of programmes and policy-making,
	Recognizing that the use of the Internet poses new opportunities and challenges to international cooperation in countering drug abuse and illicit production and trafficking, and recognizing also the need for increased cooperation among States and the exchange of information, including with reference to national experiences, on how to counter the promotion of drug abuse and illicit drug trafficking through this instrument and on ways to use the Internet for information concerning drug demand reduction, 
	Convinced that civil society, including non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations, should continue to play an active role and make an effective contribution to countering the world drug problem,
	Acknowledging with appreciation the increased efforts and achievements of many States, relevant international organizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations in countering drug abuse and illicit production of and trafficking in drugs, and that international cooperation has shown that positive results can be achieved through sustained and collective efforts,

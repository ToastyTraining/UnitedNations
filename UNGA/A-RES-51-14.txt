	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/51/637)]


51/14.Financing of the United Nations Mission in Haiti

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Mission in Haiti1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

	Recalling Security Council resolution 1048 (1996) of 29 February 1996, in which the Council extended the mandate of the Mission for a final period of four months, to 30 June 1996, as well as all previous Security Council resolutions on the Mission,

	Recalling also its decision 48/477 of 23 December 1993 on the financing of the Mission and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 50/90 B of 7 June 1996,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling further its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,


	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Mission by certain Governments,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Mission in Haiti as at 29 October 1996, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 19.9 million United States dollars, representing 6 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Mission to the period ending 30 June 1996, notes that some 23 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

	4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Mission in full and on time;

	5.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;2

	6.	Shares the concern expressed by the Advisory Committee in paragraph 9 of its report,2 and requests the Secretary-General to submit detailed explanations to the General Assembly on the circumstances that led to the overexpenditures of approximately 6.7 million dollars with respect to the original estimates;

	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

	8.	Decides to reduce the appropriation and apportionment provided by the General Assembly in its resolution 50/90 B in the amount of                 15,897,900 dollars gross (15,440,300 dollars net), inclusive of the amount of 377,400 dollars for the support account for peacekeeping operations, for the liquidation of the Mission for the period beginning 1 July 1996, to the amount of 1,197,100 dollars gross (1,185,800 dollars net), inclusive of the amount of 377,400 dollars for the support account for peacekeeping operations;


	9.	Decides also that, for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission, there shall be set off against the apportionment, as provided for in paragraph 8 above, their respective share in the amount of 1,197,100 dollars gross (1,185,800 dollars net) from the unencumbered balance of 17,390,100 dollars gross (16,715,100 dollars net) for the period from 1 August 1995 to 29 February 1996;

	10.	Decides further that, for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission, their share in the amount of 1,197,100 dollars gross (1,185,800 dollars net) from the unencumbered balance of 17,390,100 dollars gross (16,715,100 dollars net) for the period from 1 August 1995 to 29 February 1996 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations;

	11.	Decides that the remaining unencumbered balance of                  16,193,000 dollars gross (15,529,300 dollars net) for the period from           1 August 1995 to 29 February 1996 shall be credited to Member States;

	12.	Decides also to keep under review during its fifty-first session the agenda item entitled "Financing of the United Nations Mission in Haiti".

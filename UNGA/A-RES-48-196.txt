	Aware also of the serious destruction and devastation of the productive areas of the territory of Sierra Leone, and of its economy as a whole, brought about by the spill-over effect of the conflict in Liberia,

	Concerned at the consequent devastating effects on the lives and properties of Sierra Leoneans in the eastern and southern provinces, which have resulted in massive outflows of refugees and displaced persons,

	Alarmed at the astronomical cost to the Government of Sierra Leone of protecting its territory and people from the spill-over effect of the conflict in Liberia,

	Conscious of the need for the international community to assist Sierra Leone in the rehabilitation of its economy and the effective implementation of reconstruction and rehabilitation programmes, which require the mobilization of substantial resources that are beyond the current means of the country,

	Aware that the financial crisis that Sierra Leone is undergoing has led to a slowing down of its economic and social development,

	1.	Expresses its gratitude to the Secretary-General for his efforts in mobilizing the international community, the United Nations system and other organizations to provide assistance to Sierra Leone;

	2.	Calls upon the international community and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to provide Sierra Leone with technical, financial and other forms of assistance for the repatriation and resettlement of Sierra Leonean refugees, returnees and displaced persons;

	3.	Appeals to the international community and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to provide adequate assistance for the rehabilitation of the economy of Sierra Leone and the reconstruction of its devastated areas;

	4.	Urges all States and relevant United Nations bodies to provide all possible assistance to help the Government of Sierra Leone meet the critical humanitarian needs of the population and to provide, as appropriate, food, medicine and essential equipment for hospitals and schools;

	5.	Urgently reiterates its appeal to the international community, including the specialized agencies and other organizations and bodies of the United Nations system, to contribute generously, through bilateral and multilateral channels, to the economic and social development of Sierra Leone;

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts to mobilize the resources necessary for an effective programme of financial, technical and material assistance to Sierra Leone;

	7.	Also requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its forty-ninth session on the implementation of the present resolution;

	8.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its forty-ninth session an item entitled "International assistance to Sierra Leone".

Benefit provisions
	6.	Endorses the decision taken by the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Board in 2007, in which it reaffirmed its earlier decision maintaining that the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund should determine entitlements to pension benefits, in particular under articles 34 and 35 of the Regulations of the Fund, which cover spousal benefits, in accordance with the personal status of a participant as recognized and reported to the Fund by the participant's employing organization, on the understanding that the final verification that the personal status has remained the same will be done by the Fund at the time of granting such pension benefits;

	8.	Also approves the amendment to article 24 (b) of the Regulations of the Fund, as set out in annex XIV to the report of the Board, which would allow participants who return to active contributory service after a period of disability to count such periods of disability as contributory service without requiring the participant to pay contributions for that period;
	9.	Further approves the agreement of the Board to clarify that the scope of the revision in 2006 of article 24, concerning the elimination of the limitation on the right to restoration based on years of prior service, did not cover only those participants who had received a withdrawal settlement, but also those who had elected a deferred retirement benefit (full or partial) as long as no periodic benefit payments of their deferred benefit had been made, as set out in paragraphs 329 and 330 of the report of the Board, and as clarified in the technical amendments to the Regulations of the Fund, set out in annex XIV to the report of the Board;

	72/267.	The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the link between the illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts


	The General Assembly, 
	Recognizing that the trade in conflict diamonds continues to be a matter of serious international concern, which can be directly linked to the fuelling of armed conflict, the activities of rebel movements aimed at undermining or overthrowing legitimate Governments and the illicit traffic in and proliferation of armaments, especially small arms and light weapons, 
	Recognizing also the devastating impact of conflicts fuelled by the trade in conflict diamonds on the peace, safety and security of people in affected countries, and the systematic and gross human rights violations that have been perpetrated in such conflicts, 
	Noting the negative impact of such conflicts on regional stability and the obligations placed upon States by the Charter of the United Nations regarding the maintenance of international peace and security, and recognizing that continued action to curb the trade in conflict diamonds is imperative, 
	Noting with appreciation that the Kimberley Process, as an international initiative led by Participants, has pursued its deliberations on an inclusive basis involving concerned stakeholders, including producing, exporting and importing States, the diamond industry and civil society, as well as applicant States and international organizations, 
	Noting that the vast majority of rough diamonds produced in the world are from legitimate sources, recalling that the elimination of conflict diamonds from legitimate trade is the primary objective of the Kimberley Process, and stressing the need to continue its activities in order to achieve this objective,
	Welcoming the important contribution of the Kimberley Process, which was initiated by African diamond-producing countries, and calling for the consistent implementation of commitments made by Kimberley Process Participants and the diamond industry and civil society organizations, as observers, 
	Acknowledging the successful role that the Kimberley Process has played, in the last 15 years, in stemming the flow of conflict diamonds and the valuable development impact it has had in improving the lives of most people dependent on the trade in diamonds, 
	Acknowledging also that the diamond sector is an important catalyst for promoting economic and social development, which are necessary for poverty reduction and meeting the requirements of the Sustainable Development Goals in many producing countries, particularly in developing countries, 
	Recalling its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development", in which it adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, committed itself to working tirelessly for the full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, recognized that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, and expressed its commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental - in a balanced and integrated manner and to building upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking to address their unfinished business, 
	Recalling also the positive benefits of the legitimate diamond trade to producing countries and its critical contribution to the economies of the producing, exporting and importing States, and underlining the need for continued international action to prevent the problem of conflict diamonds from negatively affecting the trade in legitimate diamonds, 
	Recalling further the Charter and all the relevant resolutions of the Security Council related to conflict diamonds, and determined to contribute to and support the implementation of the measures provided for in those resolutions, 
	Recalling Security Council resolution 1459 (2003) of 28 January 2003, in which the Council strongly supported the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme1 as a valuable contribution against trafficking in conflict diamonds, 
	Noting with satisfaction that the implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme continues to have a positive impact in reducing the opportunity for conflict diamonds to play a role in fuelling armed conflict and helps to protect legitimate trade and ensure the effective implementation of the relevant resolutions on trade in conflict diamonds, 
	Acknowledging that lessons learned from the Kimberley Process may be useful for the work of the Peacebuilding Commission in its consideration of the countries included in its agenda, as appropriate, 
	Recognizing that regular review and reform of the Kimberley Process will be necessary to keep pace with and aim to address the ongoing threat of instability, conflict and contemporary challenges in the diamond trade, as well as to seize contemporary opportunities,
	Welcoming the implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme in such a way as not to impede the legitimate trade in diamonds or impose an undue burden on Governments or industry, particularly smaller producers, nor to hinder the development of the diamond industry, 
	Welcoming also the decision of the 54 Kimberley Process Participants, representing 81 countries, including the 28 States members of the European Union represented by the European Commission, to address the problem of conflict diamonds by participating in the Kimberley Process and implementing the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, 
	Welcoming further the demonstration by Gabon of its determination to become a Kimberley Process Participant and its having met the main requirements,
	Noting the decision of the General Council of the World Trade Organization of 11 December 2012 granting an extension until 31 December 2018 of a waiver with respect to the measures taken to implement the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme,
	Recognizing that State sovereignty should be fully respected and that the principles of equality, mutual benefits and consensus should be adhered to, 
	Recognizing also that the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which came into effect on 1 January 2003, will be credible only if all Participants have the requisite national legislation coupled with effective and credible internal systems of control designed to eliminate the presence of conflict diamonds in the chain of producing, exporting and importing rough diamonds within their own territories and across their borders, while taking into account that differences in production methods and trading practices, as well as differences in the institutional controls thereof, may require different approaches to meeting minimum standards, encouraging all Participants to exceed them and to work towards overall compliance with the Kimberley Process standards, 
	Recalling its resolution 71/277 of 2 February 2017 and its previous resolutions 55/56 of 1 December 2000, 56/263 of 13 March 2002, 57/302 of 15 April 2003, 58/290 of 14 April 2004, 59/144 of 15 December 2004, 60/182 of 20 December 2005, 61/28 of 4 December 2006, 62/11 of 26 November 2007, 63/134 of 11 December 2008, 64/109 of 11 December 2009, 65/137 of 16 December 2010, 66/252 of 25 January 2012, 67/135 of 18 December 2012, 68/128 of 18 December 2013, 69/136 of 12 December 2014 and 70/252 of 22 January 2016, in which it called, inter alia, for the development and implementation as well as a periodic review of proposals for a simple, effective and pragmatic international certification scheme for rough diamonds,

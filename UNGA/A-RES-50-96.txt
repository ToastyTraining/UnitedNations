	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Second Committee (A/50/617/Add.1)]


50/96.Economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against developing countries


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling the relevant principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations,

	Reaffirming that no State may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights,

	Bearing in mind the general principles governing the international trading system and trade policies for development contained in relevant resolutions, rules and provisions of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the World Trade Organization,

	Reaffirming its resolutions 44/215 of 22 December 1989, 46/210 of 20 December 1991 and 48/168 of 21 December 1993,

	Gravely concerned that the use of coercive economic measures adversely affects the economy and development efforts of developing countries and has a general negative impact on international economic cooperation and on worldwide efforts to move towards a non-discriminatory and open trading system,

	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General, 1/ which contains a summary of the deliberations of the group of experts on coercive economic measures;


	2.	Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use by some developed countries of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries which are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles contained in the Charter of the United Nations, as a means of forcibly imposing the will of one State on another;

	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to assign to the Department for Economic and Social Information and Policy Analysis of the Secretariat, in cooperation with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the task of continuing to monitor the imposition of measures of this nature and to prepare possible methodologies or criteria for evaluating the impact of such measures on the affected countries, including the impact on trade and development, for the consideration of Member States;

	4.	Also requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session on the implementation of the present resolution.

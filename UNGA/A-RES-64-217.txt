	Reaffirming the Beijing Declaration2 and Platform for Action3 and the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century",4
	Reaffirming also the commitments to gender equality and the advancement of women made at the Millennium Summit,5 the 2005 World Summit6 and other major United Nations summits, conferences and special sessions, and reaffirming further that their full, effective and accelerated implementation are integral to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals,
	Reaffirming further the United Nations Millennium Declaration,5 which affirms that the equal rights and opportunities of women and men must be assured, and calls for, inter alia, the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women as being effective in and essential to eradicating poverty and hunger, combating diseases and stimulating development that is truly sustainable,
	Recalling the outcomes of the International Conference on Financing for Development7 and the World Summit on Sustainable Development,8 the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development9 and the Outcome of the Conference on the World Financial and Economic Crisis and Its Impact on Development,10 
	Taking note with appreciation of the discussion on women in development in the Commission on the Status of Women at its fiftieth session, and recalling its agreed conclusions on "Enhanced participation of women in development: an enabling environment for achieving gender equality and the advancement of women, taking into account, inter alia, the fields of education, health and work",11 
	Recognizing that access to basic affordable health care, preventive health information and the highest standard of health, including in the areas of sexual and reproductive health, is critical to women's economic advancement, that lack of economic empowerment and independence increases women's vulnerability to a range of negative consequences, including the risk of contracting HIV/AIDS, and that the neglect of the full enjoyment of human rights by women severely limits their opportunities in public and private life, including the opportunity for education and economic and political empowerment,
	Reaffirming that gender equality is of fundamental importance for achieving sustained and inclusive economic growth, poverty eradication and sustainable development, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and United Nations conferences, and that investing in the development of women and girls has a multiplier effect, in particular on productivity, efficiency and sustained and inclusive economic growth, in all sectors of the economy, especially in key areas such as agriculture, industry and services,
	Reaffirming also the significant contribution that women make to the economy, that women are key contributors to the economy and to combating poverty and inequalities through both remunerated and unremunerated work at home, in the community and in the workplace and that the empowerment of women is a critical factor in the eradication of poverty, 
	Recognizing that the difficult socio-economic conditions that exist in many developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, have contributed to the feminization of poverty, 
	Expressing deep concern over the disproportionate negative impact on women of the multiple interrelated and mutually exacerbating current global crises, in particular the world financial and economic crisis, the volatile energy prices, the food crisis and the challenges posed by climate change, 
	Noting that gender biases in labour markets and women's lack of control over their own labour and earned income are also major factors in women's vulnerability to poverty and, together with women's disproportionate responsibilities for domestic work, result in a lack of economic autonomy and influence in economic decision-making within households and in society at all levels, 
	Recognizing that population and development issues, education and training, health, nutrition, the environment, water supply, sanitation, housing, communications, science and technology and decent employment opportunities are important elements for effective poverty eradication and the advancement and empowerment of women, 
	Welcoming its resolution 63/311 of 14 September 2009, in particular the provisions on strengthening the institutional arrangements for support of gender equality and the empowerment of women, reaffirming its strong support expressed therein for the consolidation of the Office of the Special Adviser on Gender Issues and Advancement of Women, the Division for the Advancement of Women, the United Nations Development Fund for Women and the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women into a composite entity, taking into account the existing mandates, to be led by an Under-Secretary-General, and looking forward to the full implementation of resolution 63/311,
	Recognizing, in this context, the importance of respect for all human rights, including the right to development, and of a national and international environment that promotes, inter alia, justice, gender equality, equity, civil and political participation and civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights and fundamental freedoms for the advancement and empowerment of women, 
	Reaffirming the need to eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education by the earliest possible date and at all levels by 2015, and reaffirming that equal access to education and training at all levels, in particular in business, trade, administration, information and communications technology and other new technologies, and fulfilment of the need to eliminate gender inequalities at all levels, are essential for gender equality, the empowerment of women and poverty eradication and to allow women's full and equal contribution to, and equal opportunity to benefit from, development, 
	Recognizing that poverty eradication and the achievement and preservation of peace are mutually reinforcing, and recognizing also that peace is inextricably linked to equality between women and men and to development,
	Aware that, while globalization and liberalization processes have created employment opportunities for women in many countries, they have also made some women, especially in developing countries and in particular in the least developed countries, more vulnerable to problems caused by increased economic volatility, including in the agricultural sector, and that special support, particularly for women who are small-scale farmers, and empowerment are necessary to enable them to take advantage of the opportunities arising from agricultural market liberalization,
	Recognizing that enhanced trade opportunities for developing countries, including through trade liberalization, will improve the economic condition of their societies, including women, which is of particular importance in rural communities, 
	Expressing its concern that, while women represent an important and growing proportion of business owners, their contribution to economic and social development is constrained by, inter alia, the denial and lack of equal rights and their lack of access to legal aid, education, training, information, support services and credit facilities including salaries, and control over land, capital, technology and other areas of production,
	Expressing its concern also regarding the underrepresentation of women in political and economic decision-making, and stressing the importance of mainstreaming a gender perspective in the formulation, implementation and evaluation of all policies and programmes, including in conflict prevention and fragile situations and in post-conflict peacebuilding,

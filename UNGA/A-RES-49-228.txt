	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/49/756/Add.1)]


49/228.Financing of the United Nations Protection Force


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Protection Force 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Noting with concern the comments of the Advisory Committee, contained in paragraphs 41 and 42 of its report, regarding the use of international contractual personnel in the United Nations Protection Force, and noting the additional information provided by the representatives of the Secretary-General on this subject,

	Recalling Security Council resolutions 727 (1992) of 8 January 1992 and 740 (1992) of 7 February 1992, in which the Council endorsed the sending of a group of military liaison officers to Yugoslavia to promote maintenance of the cease-fire,

	Recalling also Security Council resolution 743 (1992) of 21 February 1992, by which the Council established the Force, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended its mandate, the latest of which was resolution 947 (1994) of 30 September 1994,

	Recalling further its resolution 46/233 of 19 March 1992 on the financing of the Force and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which were resolutions 48/238 A of 24 March 1994 and 48/238 B of 29 July 1994 and decisions 48/470 A of 23 December 1993, 48/470 B of 9 March 1994, 48/470 C of 14 April 1994 and 49/413 of 8 December 1994,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Force are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force by certain Governments,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

		Regrets that, owing to the late submission of relevant reports, it found itself obliged to give commitment authority without assessment for one month ending 31 December 1994 in order to respond to the operational requirements of the United Nations Protection Force;

		Takes note of the status of contributions to the Force as at 20 December 1994, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 660,524,218 United States dollars, and urges all Member States concerned to make every possible effort to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

		Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peace-keeping activities, particularly as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, due to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments, particularly Member States in arrears;

		Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure the payment of their assessed contributions to the Force promptly and in full;

		Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/ subject to the provisions of the present resolution;

		Also endorses the recommendation of the Advisory Committee contained in paragraph 42 of its report regarding the use of international contractual personnel in the Force, pending a further examination by the General Assembly of this issue, and on the understanding that the recommendation will be applied with the necessary flexibility to ensure that operational requirements are met;

		Notes that the thorough and independent investigation and evaluation of the use of international contractual personnel in the Force called for by the Advisory Committee in paragraph 72 of its report on the administrative and budgetary aspects of the financing of the United Nations peace-keeping operations 3/ is currently being conducted by the Office of Internal Oversight Services, and requests that the results of this study be submitted to the General Assembly in order to enable it to take a decision on this issue at its resumed forty-ninth session;

		Requests the Secretary-General to entrust the Office of Internal Oversight Services with undertaking an independent and thorough review of the management structure in the civilian staff component of the Force, and to report thereon to the General Assembly before the end of its resumed forty-ninth session;

		Also requests the Secretary-General to review the policy governing the personal use of United Nations vehicles in peace-keeping operations with a view to ensuring tighter control of such use and speedy reimbursement to the United Nations where applicable, and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its fiftieth session;

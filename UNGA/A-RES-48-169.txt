	Recognizing further that most transit countries are themselves developing countries facing serious economic problems, including the lack of adequate infrastructure in the transport sector,

	Recalling that measures to deal with the transit problems of land-locked developing countries require closer and even more effective cooperation and collaboration between those countries and their transit neighbours,






	Recalling the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, adopted on 10 December 1982, 1/

	Recognizing the important role played by bilateral cooperative arrangements and regional and subregional cooperation and integration in comprehensively solving the transit problems of the land-locked developing countries and improving the transit-transport systems in land-locked and transit developing countries,

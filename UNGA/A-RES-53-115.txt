	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Third Committee (A/53/617)]


53/115.  International cooperation against the world drug problem

    The General Assembly,

    Recalling its resolution 52/92 of 12 December 1997,

    Welcoming the outcome of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly devoted to countering the world drug problem together, held in New York from 8 to 10 June 1998, and the determination of Governments at the highest political level to overcome the world drug problem by a full and balanced application of national, regional and international strategies to reduce the illicit demand for, production of and trafficking in drugs, as reflected in the Political Declaration,1 the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction,2 and the measures to enhance international cooperation to counter the world drug problem,3


    Gravely concerned that, despite continued increased efforts by States, relevant international organizations, civil society and non-governmental organizations, there is a global expansion of the drug problem, which constitutes a serious threat to the health, safety and well-being of all mankind, in particular young people, in all countries, undermines development, socio-economic and political stability and democratic institutions, entails an increasing economic cost for Governments, also threatens the national security and sovereignty of States, as well as the dignity and hope of millions of people and their families, and causes irreparable loss of human lives,

    Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug-trafficking activities and other criminal activities, such as money-laundering and illicit traffic in arms, precursors and essential chemicals, and by the increasing transnational links between them, and recognizing the need for international cooperation and implementation of effective strategies on the basis of the outcome of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly, which are essential to achieving results against all forms of transnational criminal activities,

    Deeply convinced that the special session made a significant contribution to a new comprehensive framework for international cooperation, based on an integrated and balanced approach with strategies, measures, methods, practical activities, goals and specific targets to be met, that all States, the United Nations system and other international organizations must implement them with concrete actions and that the international financial institutions, such as the World Bank, and the regional development banks should be invited to include action against the world drug problem in their programmes, taking into account the priorities of States,

    Convinced that civil society, including non-governmental organizations, can make an effective contribution to and should play an active role in addressing the world drug problem,

    Emphasizing the importance of the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction that introduces a global approach, recognizing a new balance between illicit supply and demand reduction, under the principle of shared responsibility, aims at preventing the use of drugs and at reducing the adverse consequences of drug abuse, special attention being paid to youth, and is one of the pillars of the new global strategy and an important initiative of the United Nations Decade against Drug Abuse, 1991-2000, and reaffirming the need for demand reduction programmes,

    Emphasizing equally the importance of supply reduction as an integral part of a balanced drug control strategy under the principles enshrined in the Action Plan on International Cooperation on the Eradication of Illicit Drug Crops and on Alternative Development,4 and reaffirming the need for alternative development programmes,

    Underlining the role of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs as the principal United Nations policy-making body on drug control issues, the leadership role and commendable work of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the main focus for concerted multilateral action and the important role of the International Narcotics Control Board as an independent monitoring authority, as set out in the international drug control treaties,

    Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific and medical purposes to prevent the diversion of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand in line with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961,5


    Acknowledging that there are links, under certain circumstances, between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures, including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries, which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production,

    Stressing that respect for all human rights is and must be an essential component of measures taken to address the drug problem,

    Ensuring that women and men benefit equally, and without any discrimination, from strategies directed against the world drug problem, through their involvement in all stages of programmes and policy-making,

    Recognizing that the use of the Internet poses new opportunities and challenges to international cooperation in combating drug abuse and illicit production and trafficking,

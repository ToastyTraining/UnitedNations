Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 20 December 2012
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/67/457/Add.2 and Corr.1)]
67/167.	Committee on the Rights of the Child


	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming the Convention on the Rights of the Child1 and the Optional Protocols thereto,2
	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the status of the Convention3 and the report of the Committee on the Rights of the Child,4
	Taking note also of the request of the Committee contained in annex III to its report,
	Recalling its resolutions 66/254 of 23 February 2012 and 66/295 of 17 September 2012 on the intergovernmental process of the General Assembly on strengthening and enhancing the effective functioning of the human rights treaty body system, and recognizing in this regard that a long-term solution to the problem of the increasing backlog of reports of States parties to the Convention and the Optional Protocols thereto awaiting review by the Committee can be found in this context,
	1.	Expresses its appreciation for the efforts made so far by the Committee on the Rights of the Child to improve the efficiency of its working methods, and encourages the Committee to build upon its activities in this regard;
	2.	Notes that a backlog of more than 100 reports exists related to the submission by States parties of their reports under the Convention on the Rights of the Child1 and the Optional Protocols thereto2 in conformity with their obligations, and notes with concern that if this backlog is not addressed, it will impede the ability of the Committee to consider reports in a timely manner;
	3.	Authorizes the Committee, recognizing that such a temporary measure is not a long-term solution to the backlog and without prejudice to the intergovernmental process of the General Assembly on strengthening and enhancing the effective functioning of the human rights treaty body system, to meet in parallel chambers, of nine members each, for the 5 working days of one of its three pre-sessional working group meetings in 2014 and 13 working days of one of its three regular sessions in 2015, for the purposes of considering the reports of the States parties submitted under article 44 of the Convention, article 8 of the Optional Protocol thereto on the involvement of children in armed conflict5 and article 12 of the Optional Protocol thereto on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography,6 taking due account of equitable geographical distribution and the principal legal systems;
	4.	Invites States parties to the Convention and the Optional Protocols thereto to adhere to the page limit established by the Committee for their reports, and notes that this would reduce the operating costs of the Committee.

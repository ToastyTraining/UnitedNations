Resolution adopted by the General Assembly

[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/55/712)]
55/235.	Scale of assessments for the apportionment of the expenses of United Nations peacekeeping operations


	The General Assembly,


I
	Reaffirming the principles set out in its resolutions 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963 and 3101 (XXVIII) of 11 December 1973,
	1.	Reaffirms the following general principles underlying the financing of United Nations peacekeeping operations:
	(a)	The financing of such operations is the collective responsibility of all States Members of the United Nations and, accordingly, the costs of peacekeeping operations are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations;
	(b)	In order to meet the expenditures caused by such operations, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures under the regular budget of the United Nations;
	(c)	Whereas the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions to peacekeeping operations, the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards peacekeeping operations involving heavy expenditures;
	(d)	The special responsibilities of the permanent members of the Security Council for the maintenance of peace and security should be borne in mind in connection with their contributions to the financing of peace and security operations;
	(e)	Where circumstances warrant, the General Assembly should give special consideration to the situation of any Member States which are victims of, and those which are otherwise involved in, the events or actions leading to a peacekeeping operation;
	2.	Recognizes the need to reform the current methodology for apportioning the expenses of peacekeeping operations;
	3.	Notes with appreciation voluntary contributions made to peacekeeping operations and, without prejudice to the principle of collective responsibility, invites Member States to consider making such contributions;


II
	4.	Decides that assessment rates for the financing of peacekeeping operations should be based on the scale of assessments for the regular budget of the United Nations, with an appropriate and transparent system of adjustments based on levels of Member States, consistent with the principles outlined above;
	5.	Decides also that the permanent members of the Security Council should form a separate level and that, consistent with their special responsibilities for the maintenance of peace and security, they should be assessed at a higher rate than for the regular budget;
	6.	Decides further that all discounts resulting from adjustments to the regular budget assessment rates of Member States in levels C through J shall be borne on a pro rata basis by the permanent members of the Security Council;
	7.	Decides that the least developed countries should be placed in a separate level and receive the highest rate of discount available under the scale;
	8.	Decides also that the statistical data used for setting the rates of assessment for peacekeeping should be the same as the data used in preparing the regular budget scale of assessments, subject to the provisions of the present resolution;
	9.	Decides further to create levels of discount to facilitate automatic, predictable movement between categories on the basis of the per capita gross national product of Member States;
	10.	Decides that, as from 1 July 2001, the rates of assessment for peacekeeping should be based on the ten levels of contribution and parameters set forth in the table below:


Peacekeeping scale levels based on average per capita gross national product (PCGNP) of all Member States

	11.	Decides also that Member States will be assigned to the lowest level of contribution with the highest discount for which they are eligible, unless they indicate a decision to move to a higher level;
	12.	Decides further that for purposes of determining the eligibility of Member States for contribution in particular levels during the 2001-2003 scale period, the average per capita gross national product of all Member States will be 4,797 United States dollars and the per capita gross national product of Member States will be the average of 1993 to 1998 figures;
	13.	Decides that transitions as specified above will occur in equal increments over the transition period as designated above;
	14.	Decides also that after 2001-2003, transition periods of two years will apply to countries moving up by two levels, and that transition periods of three years will apply to countries moving up by three levels or more without prejudice to paragraph 11 above;
	15.	Requests the Secretary-General to update the composition of the levels described above on a triennial basis, in conjunction with the regular budget scale of assessment reviews, in accordance with the criteria established above, and to report thereon to the General Assembly;
	16.	Decides that the structure of levels to be implemented from 1 July 2001 shall be reviewed after nine years;
	17.	Decides also that Member States may agree upon adjustments to their assessment rates under the ad hoc scale in the light of the special transitional circumstances applying during the period 1 January to 30 June 2001;

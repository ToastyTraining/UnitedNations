[without reference to a Main Committee (A/58/L.35 and Add.1)]
58/26.  Emergency humanitarian assistance to Malawi

	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its relevant resolutions in particular, resolutions 46/182 of 19 December 1991, 54/219 and 54/233 of 22 December 1999, 55/163 of 14 December 2000 and 56/103 of 14 December 2001, and Economic and Social Council resolution 2002/32 of 26 July 2002,
	Convinced that all people have the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of themselves and their families, including food, medical care, necessary social services and security in the event of lack of livelihood in circumstances beyond their control,
	Noting that drought and other types of natural disasters have proved to be recurring phenomena in Malawi,
	Reiterating that natural disasters damage the social and economic infrastructure of affected countries, although the long-term consequences of such natural disasters are especially severe for poor developing countries, including Malawi, and hamper sustainable development,
	Concerned that Malawi continues to face natural catastrophes such as drought, floods and heavy rains, causing serious crop failure, loss of life and extensive damage to property and infrastructure,
	Noting that an increasing number of cases of malnutrition, particularly among children, and deaths due to hunger-related diseases continue to occur in Malawi, with adverse long-term consequences,
	Deeply alarmed that the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS has increased the vulnerability of communities, creating greater levels of dependency and severely reducing their ability to cope with humanitarian crises,
	Gravely concerned that the capability of the national economy to absorb such shocks has been seriously eroded and that the frequent occurrence of extreme natural disasters has increasingly contributed to the stagnation of social and economic development,
	Acknowledging that national efforts are critical to prevent the deepening of the humanitarian crisis,
	Noting with appreciation the mobilization and allocation of resources by States, relevant organizations of the United Nations system and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to complement the national efforts of Malawi,
	Aware that international cooperation remains a critical factor for the success of all national efforts to address the crisis situation,
	1.	Welcomes the positive role of the Government of Malawi in the relief operations, in particular the close coordination between the United Nations system and the Government;
	2.	Also welcomes the launching by the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat of the consolidated appeal for Malawi on 18 July 2002 and the humanitarian appeal for 2004 on 18 November 2003, as well as the continued monitoring of the situation, including through the activities of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-General for Humanitarian Needs in Southern Africa;
	3.	Requests the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs to continue to seek ways and means of improving the effectiveness of the United Nations consolidated appeals process;
	4.	Calls upon all States to adopt, where required, and to continue to implement effectively, the legislative and other appropriate measures necessary to mitigate the effects of natural disasters, inter alia, in the areas of disaster prevention, including building regulations and appropriate land use, as well as early warning, disaster preparedness and capacity-building in disaster response, and in that context requests the international community to continue to assist Malawi as the need arises;
	5.	Emphasizes the importance of enhanced international cooperation, including with the United Nations and regional organizations, to assist Malawi in its efforts to build capacity and to predict, prepare for and respond to natural disasters; 
	6.	Stresses, in that context, the need to further strengthen international cooperation in the provision of emergency humanitarian assistance in support of the efforts of Malawi to deal with natural disasters in all their phases, from relief and mitigation to development, including through the provision of adequate resources, and encourages the effective use of multilateral mechanisms; 
	7.	Also stresses that emergency humanitarian assistance for natural disasters should be provided in accordance with the guiding principles contained in the annex to resolution 46/182, on the basis of human dimensions and needs; 
	8.	Urges the international community to continue to support the efforts of Malawi to fight the HIV/AIDS pandemic, poverty and malnutrition in order to increase its capacity to cope during natural disasters;
	9.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly for consideration at its fifty-ninth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution.

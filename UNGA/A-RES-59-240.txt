	Recalling also its resolution 58/291 of 6 May 2004,
	Reaffirming the resolve expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration1 to ensure that globalization becomes a positive force for the people of the world,
	Recognizing that globalization and interdependence have opened new opportunities for the growth of the world economy and development, that globalization offers new perspectives for the integration of developing countries into the world economy and that it can improve the overall performance of the economies of developing countries by opening up market opportunities for their exports, by promoting the transfer of information, skills and technology and by increasing the financial resources available for investment in physical and intangible assets, acknowledging that globalization has also brought new challenges for growth and sustainable development and that developing countries have been facing special difficulties in responding to them, recognizing that some countries have successfully adapted to the changes and benefited from globalization but that many others, especially the least developed countries, have  remained marginalized in the globalizing world economy, and recognizing also that, as stated in the Millennium Declaration, the benefits and costs of globalization are very unevenly distributed,
	Recognizing also that a universal, rule-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system, as well as meaningful trade liberalization, can substantially stimulate development worldwide, benefiting countries at all stages of development, reaffirming its commitment to trade liberalization and to ensuring that trade plays its full part in promoting economic growth, employment and development for all, welcoming in that regard the decisions taken by the World Trade Organization to place the needs and interests of developing countries at the heart of its work programme, and committing itself to their implementation,
	Recognizing further that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,
	Noting that an overall commitment to multiculturalism helps to provide an environment preventing and combating discrimination and promoting solidarity and tolerance in our societies, 
	Recognizing that an enabling economic environment should, inter alia, foster a dynamic and well-functioning business sector and include efforts to further promote good corporate and public sector governance, to combat corruption in the public and private sectors and to promote the strengthening of and respect for the rule of law,
	Noting that particular attention must be given, in the context of globalization, to the objective of protecting, promoting and enhancing the rights and welfare of women and girls, as stated in the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action,2 
	Taking note of the report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization entitled A Fair Globalization: Creating Opportunities for All3 as a contribution to the international dialogue towards a fully inclusive and equitable globalization,
	Noting the report of the Commission on the Private Sector and Development entitled Unleashing Entrepreneurship: Making Business Work for the Poor,4
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;5 
	2.	Reaffirms that the United Nations has a central role in promoting international cooperation for development and in promoting policy coherence on global development issues, including in the context of globalization and interdependence;
	3.	Reaffirms also that each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development and that the role of national policies and development strategies cannot be overemphasized;
	4.	Invites the international community, including all Member States, to devote special attention to improving resource flows for development, including public and private, foreign and domestic, to assist the developing countries, particularly the least developed countries, to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration;1
	5.	Stresses that, in the common pursuit of growth, poverty eradication and sustainable development, a critical challenge is to ensure the necessary internal conditions for mobilizing domestic savings, both public and private, sustaining adequate levels of productive investment and increasing human capacity, while a crucial task is to enhance the efficacy, coherence and consistency of macroeconomic policies and an enabling domestic environment is vital for mobilizing domestic resources, increasing productivity, reducing capital flight, encouraging the private sector and attracting and making effective use of international investment and assistance, and in this regard stresses also that efforts to create such an environment should be supported by the international community;
	6.	Underlines the fact that, in addressing the linkages between globalization and sustainable development, particular focus should be placed on identifying and implementing mutually reinforcing policies and practices that promote sustained economic growth, social development and environmental protection and that this requires efforts at both the national and international levels;
	7.	Reiterates that success in meeting the objectives of development and poverty eradication depends, inter alia, on good governance, both within individual countries and at the international level, sound economic policies, solid democratic institutions that are responsive to the needs of the people and improved infrastructure, which are the basis for sustained growth, poverty eradication and employment creation, and that transparency in financial, monetary and trading systems and commitment to an open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system are equally essential;
	8.	Stresses that improved coherence between national and international efforts and between the international monetary, financial and trading systems is fundamental for sound global economic governance; in this context reaffirms the commitment to improving the coherence between those systems in order to enhance their capacities to better respond to the needs of development and recognizes that the institutional dimension in terms of development is central; emphasizes that development should be at the centre of the international economic agenda and that  coherence between national development strategies, on the one hand, and international obligations and commitments, on the other, contributes to the creation of an enabling economic environment for development; and stresses the need to broaden and strengthen the participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in international economic decision-making and norm-setting;
	9.	Stresses also that development strategies have to be formulated with a view to minimizing the negative social impact of globalization and maximizing its positive impact, while ensuring that all groups of the population, in particular the poorest, benefit from it, and that at the international level, efforts have to converge on the means to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration;
	10.	Underlines the fact that the increasing interdependence of national economies in a globalizing world and the emergence of rule-based regimes for international economic relations have meant that the space for national economic policy, i.e., the scope for domestic policies, especially in the areas of trade, investment and industrial development, is now often framed by international disciplines, commitments and global market considerations, that it is for each Government to evaluate the trade-off between the benefits of accepting international rules and commitments and the constraints posed by the loss of policy space and that it is particularly important for developing countries, bearing in mind development goals and objectives, that all countries take into account the need for appropriate balance between national policy space and international disciplines and commitments;
	11.	Reaffirms that education, employment creation and improvement of working conditions, which are some of the indispensable elements of poverty eradication, social integration, gender equality and overall development, should be at the centre of development strategies and international cooperation in support of national policies, and recognizes the need to promote employment that takes into account labour standards as defined in the relevant instruments of the International Labour Organization and other international instruments;
	12.	Urges all Governments to ensure women's equal rights with men and their full and equal access to education, training, employment, technology and economic and financial resources, including credit, in particular for rural women and women in the informal sector, and to facilitate, where appropriate, the transition of women from the informal to the formal sector;
	13.	Stresses the importance of migration as a phenomenon accompanying increased globalization, including its impact on economies, and underlines further the need for greater coordination and cooperation among countries as well as relevant regional and international organizations;
	14.	Recognizes the special needs of the least developed countries, the small island developing States and the landlocked developing countries within a new global framework for transit transport cooperation for landlocked and transit developing countries, and reaffirms continued support and assistance for their endeavours, particularly in their efforts to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration, and the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010,6 the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States,7 and the Almaty Programme of Action;8
	15.	Emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing the specific concerns of countries with economies in transition so as to help them to benefit from globalization, with a view to their full integration into the world economy;
	16.	Invites all relevant agencies of the United Nations system, through, inter alia, the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, within existing resources, to continue to review the impact of their work on the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the Millennium Declaration;
	17.	Welcomes the decision taken by the General Council of the World Trade Organization on 1 August 2004,9 which rededicates and recommits members to fulfilling the development dimensions of the Doha development agenda, which places the needs of developing and least developed countries at the heart of the Doha work programme;10
	18.	Stresses the need to build an inclusive information society, which is intrinsically global in nature, and that therefore national efforts need to be supported by effective international and regional cooperation among Governments, the private sector, civil society and other stakeholders, including the international financial institutions, in order, inter alia, to assist in bridging the digital divide, promoting access to information and communication technologies, creating digital opportunities and harnessing the potential of information and communication technologies for development, and invites the World Summit on the Information Society to encourage all stakeholders in this regard;
	19.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session a report on globalization and interdependence;
	20.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixtieth session the item entitled "Globalization and interdependence".

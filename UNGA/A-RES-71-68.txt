Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 5 December 2016
[on the report of the First Committee (A/71/450)] 
71/68.	National legislation on transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology 


	The General Assembly, 
	Recognizing that disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation are essential for the maintenance of international peace and security,
	Recalling that effective national control of the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology, including those transfers that could contribute to proliferation activities, is an important tool for achieving those objectives,
	Recalling also that the States parties to the international disarmament and non-proliferation treaties have undertaken to facilitate the fullest possible exchange of materials, equipment and technological information for peaceful purposes, in accordance with the provisions of those treaties,
	Considering that the exchange of national legislation, regulations and procedures on the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology contributes to mutual understanding and confidence among Member States, 
	Convinced that such an exchange would be beneficial to Member States that are in the process of developing such legislation,
	Welcoming the electronic database established by the Office for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat, in which all information exchanged pursuant to General Assembly resolutions 57/66 of 22 November 2002, 58/42 of 8 December 2003, 59/66 of 3 December 2004, 60/69 of 8 December 2005, 62/26 of 5 December 2007, 64/40 of 2 December 2009, 66/41 of 2 December 2011 and 68/44 of 5 December 2013, entitled "National legislation on transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology", can be consulted,
	Welcoming also the adoption by the General Assembly and the entry into force of the Arms Trade Treaty1 on 2 April 2013 and 24 December 2014, respectively, and noting that the Treaty remains open for accession by any State that has not signed it, 
	Considering that, as long as not all States that report to the electronic database established by the Office for Disarmament Affairs have become party to the Treaty, the database will retain its added value,
	Reaffirming the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations,
	1.	Invites Member States that are in a position to do so, without prejudice to the provisions contained in Security Council resolution 1540 (2004) of 28 April 2004 and subsequent relevant Council resolutions, to enact or improve national legislation, regulations and procedures to exercise effective control over the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology, while ensuring that such legislation, regulations and procedures are consistent with the obligations of States parties under international treaties, such as the Arms Trade Treaty;1
	2.	Encourages Member States to provide, on a voluntary basis, information to the Secretary-General on their national legislation, regulations and procedures on the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology, as well as the changes therein, and requests the Secretary-General to make that information accessible to Member States;
	3.	Decides to remain attentive to the matter.

50/54.Review of the procedure provided for under article 11 of the statute of the Administrative Tribunal of the United Nations


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General, 1/

	Noting that the procedure provided for under article 11 of the statute of the Administrative Tribunal of the United Nations has not proved to be a constructive or useful element in the adjudication of staff disputes within the Organization, and noting also the views of the Secretary-General to that effect,

	(a)	Delete article 11;

	(b)	Renumber former articles 12, 13 and 14 as articles 11, 12 and 13, respectively, and in paragraph 3 of article 9 substitute the words "article 13" for "article 14";

	(c)	Amend paragraph 2 of article 10 by substituting the words "article 11" for "articles 11 and 12";


	2.	Decides also that, with respect to judgements rendered by the Tribunal before 1 January 1996, the statute of the Tribunal shall continue to apply as if the amendments in paragraph 1 above had not been made;

	3.	Stresses the importance for the staff and the Organization alike of ensuring a fair, efficient and expeditious internal system of justice within the United Nations, including effective mechanisms for the resolution of disputes.

	72/97.	Question of Anguilla 
         

	The General Assembly,
	Having considered the question of Anguilla and examined the relevant chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2017,1
	Taking note of the working paper prepared by the Secretariat on Anguilla2 and other relevant information,
	Recognizing that all available options for self-determination of the Territory are valid as long as they are in accordance with the freely expressed wishes of the people of Anguilla and in conformity with the clearly defined principles contained in General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, 1541 (XV) of 15 December 1960 and other resolutions of the Assembly,
	Expressing concern that 57 years after the adoption of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples,3 there still remain 17 Non-Self-Governing Territories, including Anguilla,
	Conscious of the importance of continuing the effective implementation of the Declaration, taking into account the target set by the United Nations to eradicate colonialism by 2020 and the plans of action for the Second4 and Third International Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,
	Recognizing that the specific characteristics and the aspirations of the people of Anguilla require flexible, practical and innovative approaches to the options for self-determination, without any prejudice to territorial size, geographical location, size of population or natural resources,
	Convinced that the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory should continue to guide the development of their future political status and that referendums, free and fair elections and other forms of popular consultation play an important role in ascertaining the wishes and aspirations of the people,
	Concerned by the use and exploitation of the natural resources of the 
Non-Self-Governing Territories by the administering Powers for their benefit, by
the use of the Territories as tax havens to the detriment of the world economy and by the consequences of any economic activities of the administering Powers that
are contrary to the interests of the people of the Territories, as well as to resolution 1514 (XV),
	Convinced that any negotiations to determine the status of the Territory must take place with the active involvement and participation of the people of the Territory, under the auspices of the United Nations, on a case-by-case basis, and that the views of the people of Anguilla in respect of their right to self-determination should be ascertained,
	Noting the continued cooperation of the Non-Self-Governing Territories at the local and regional levels, including participation in the work of regional organizations,
	Mindful that, in order for the Special Committee to enhance its understanding of the political status of the people of Anguilla and to fulfil its mandate effectively, it is important for it to be apprised by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland as the administering Power and to receive information from other appropriate sources, including the representatives of the Territory, concerning the wishes and aspirations of the people of the Territory,
	Aware of the importance both to Anguilla and to the Special Committee of the participation of elected and appointed representatives of Anguilla in the work of the Committee,
	Recognizing the need for the Special Committee to ensure that the appropriate bodies of the United Nations actively pursue a public awareness campaign aimed at assisting the people of Anguilla with their inalienable right to self-determination and in gaining a better understanding of the options for self-determination, on a case-by-case basis,
	Mindful, in that connection, that the holding of regional seminars in the Caribbean and Pacific regions and at Headquarters, with the active participation of representatives of the Non-Self-Governing Territories, provides a helpful means for the Special Committee to fulfil its mandate and that the regional nature of the seminars, which alternate between the Caribbean and the Pacific, is a crucial element in the context of a United Nations programme for ascertaining the political status of the Territories,
	Welcoming the Caribbean regional seminar on the theme "Implementation of the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism: the future for decolonization in the Non-Self-Governing Territories - what are the prospects?", held by the Special Committee in Kingstown and hosted by the Government of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines from 16 to 18 May 2017, as a significant and forward-looking event, which enabled the participants to assess progress made and address challenges faced in the decolonization process, review the existing working methods of the Committee and renew its commitment to implementing its historic task,
	Recognizing the importance of the conclusions and recommendations adopted by the seminar, which are annexed to the report of the Special Committee5 and which outline the findings of the seminar, including, especially, the way forward for the decolonization process within the context of the proclamation by the General Assembly of the period 2011-2020 as the Third International Decade for the Eradication of Colonialism,6
	Noting with appreciation the contribution to the development of some Territories by the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, in particular the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific, the United Nations Development Programme and the World Food Programme, as well as regional institutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, the Caribbean Community, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, the Pacific Islands Forum and the agencies of the Council of Regional Organizations in the Pacific,
	Recalling that the first regional seminar held in a Non-Self-Governing Territory was the 2003 Caribbean regional seminar in Anguilla, hosted by the territorial Government with the cooperation of the administering Power,
	Taking into account that the Territory last participated in the activities of the Special Committee in 2012, when concerns were expressed that the people of the Territory were being denied the full range of decolonization options under a drafting exercise that began in 2011, and in this regard stressing the importance of the continued participation of the Territory in order to provide the Committee with 
up-to-date information regarding the decolonization process,
	Aware of the follow-up meeting, held after the 2012 Pacific regional seminar, between the Chair of the Special Committee and the Chief Minister of Anguilla, who reiterated the urgent need for a visiting mission,
	Noting the decisions taken in 2011 to set up a drafting team to prepare a new constitution and present it for public consultation in the Territory and the recent efforts undertaken in that regard, including the establishment, in September 2015, of a new Constitutional and Electoral Reform Committee to advance constitutional and electoral reform, as well as draft proposals for electoral and constitutional reforms submitted as the draft constitution by the Committee in November 2016,
	Noting also the participation of the Territory as a member in the Caribbean Overseas Countries and Territories Council and an associate member in the Caribbean Community, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States and the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean,
	Recalling the general elections which took place in April 2015,7

	13.	Reaffirms the responsibility of the administering Power under the Charter to promote the economic and social development and preserve the cultural identity of the Territory, and requests the administering Power to take steps to enlist and make effective use of all possible assistance, on both a bilateral and a multilateral basis, in the strengthening of the economy of the Territory;

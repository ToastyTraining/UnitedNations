	Recognizing the urgent need to enhance the coherence, governance and consistency of the international monetary, financial and trading systems, and the importance of ensuring their openness, fairness and inclusiveness in order to complement national development efforts to ensure sustained economic growth and the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,

	4.	Underlines the importance of promoting international financial stability and sustainable growth, and welcomes the efforts undertaken to this end by the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Forum, as well as the consideration by the International Monetary and Financial Committee of ways to sharpen tools designed to promote international financial stability and enhance crisis prevention, inter alia, through an even-handed implementation of surveillance, including at the regional level, and a sharpening of surveillance of capital markets and systemically and regionally important countries, with a view, inter alia, to the early identification of problems and risks, integrating debt sustainability analysis, the fostering of appropriate policy responses, the possible provision of financing and other instruments designed to prevent the emergence or spread of financial crises, and further improvements in the transparency of macroeconomic data and statistical information on international capital flows;

	8.	Stresses the importance of strong domestic institutions in promoting business activities and financial stability for the achievement of growth and development, inter alia, through sound macroeconomic policies and policies aimed at strengthening the regulatory systems of the corporate, financial and banking sectors, and also stresses that international cooperation initiatives in those areas should encourage flows of capital to developing countries; 
	9.	Notes that building an environment that encourages development of the domestic business sector requires that countries undertake appropriate policies to minimize the risk of and respond to external shocks and their impact, inter alia, on growth and employment, and encourages the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to take into account the specific conditions of developing countries in determining their guidance to them in this area;
	10.	Stresses the importance of advancing in respect of the efforts to reform the international financial architecture, as envisaged in the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development,2 and in this regard encourages the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue examining the issues of the voice and effective participation of developing countries and countries with economies in transition in their decision-making processes;
	11.	Welcomes the ongoing work of the International Monetary Fund on quotas, and notes the conclusion of the Fund's Twelfth General Review of Quotas, the report on which indicated the adequacy of the current level of Fund resources and the intention of the Executive Board, during the period of the Thirteenth General Review, to monitor closely and assess the adequacy of Fund resources, to consider measures to achieve a distribution of quotas that reflects developments in the world economy and to consider measures to strengthen the governance of the Fund;
	12.	Notes the ongoing analysis by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, as mentioned in the communiqué of the Development Committee of 2 October 2004,6 of proposals on financing modalities to complement increased aid flows and commitments with innovative mechanisms, and their technical feasibility;
	13.

	14.	Reaffirms the need to adopt policies and undertake measures to reduce the cost of the transfer of migrant remittances to developing countries, and welcomes the efforts of Governments and stakeholders in this regard;
	15.	Emphasizes that it is essential to ensure the effective and equitable participation of developing countries in the formulation of financial standards and codes, underscores the need to ensure their implementation, on a voluntary and progressive basis, as a contribution to reducing vulnerability to financial crisis and contagion, and notes that more than one hundred countries participated or agreed to participate in a joint World Bank-International Monetary Fund financial sector assessment programme;7
	16.	Invites the multilateral and regional development banks and development funds to continue to play a vital role in serving the development needs of developing countries and countries with economies in transition, including through coordinated action, as appropriate, and stresses that strengthened regional development banks and subregional financial institutions add flexible financial support to national and regional development efforts, thus enhancing their ownership and overall efficiency, and are an essential source of knowledge and expertise for their developing-country members;
	17.	Calls for the continued effort of the multilateral financial institutions, in providing policy advice, technical assistance and financial support to member countries, to work on the basis of nationally owned reform and development strategies, to pay due regard to the special needs and implementing capacities of developing countries and countries with economies in transition, and to minimize the negative impacts of the adjustment programmes on the vulnerable segments of society, while taking into account the importance of gender-sensitive employment and poverty eradication policies and strategies;

	19.	Acknowledges the ongoing work towards a more comprehensive approach to sovereign debt restructurings, supports the increasing inclusion of collective action clauses in international bond issuing, and strongly encourages leading bond issuing countries and the private sector to make substantial progress on the preparation of an effective code of conduct, bearing in mind the need not to preclude emergency financing in times of crisis, to promote fair burden-sharing and minimize moral hazard, which will engage debtors and creditors to come together to restructure unsustainable debts in a timely and efficient manner;
	20.	Welcomes the ongoing efforts, including those of the Bretton Woods institutions, to improve the assessment of debt sustainability in low- and middle-income countries through, inter alia, the development of better tools to deal with exogenous shocks and the need to take country-specific factors into account;

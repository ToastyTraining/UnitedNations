Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 20 December 2012
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/67/449 and Corr.1)]
67/140.	Realizing the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities towards 2015 and beyond


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling earlier operational frameworks, such as the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons,1 which it adopted on 3 December 1982, and the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities,2 which it adopted on 20 December 1993, in which persons with disabilities are recognized as both development agents and beneficiaries in all aspects of development,
	Reaffirming the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,3 which it adopted on 13 December 2006, a landmark convention affirming the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons with disabilities, and recognizing that it is both a human rights treaty and a development tool,
	Recalling its previous resolutions on the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, in which it recognized the collective responsibility of Governments to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality and equity at the global level, and stressing the duty of Member States to achieve greater justice and equality for all, in particular persons with disabilities,
	Recalling also all of its previous resolutions on realizing the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities, as well as the relevant resolutions of the Human Rights Council and the Economic and Social Council and its functional commissions,
	Recalling further the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals,4 the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled "The future we want",5 and the outcome document of the 2011 high-level plenary meeting of the Assembly on HIV and AIDS, entitled "Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying Our efforts to Eliminate HIV and AIDS",6 which contain references to the rights, participation, well-being and perspectives of persons with disabilities in development efforts,
	Gravely concerned that persons with disabilities continue to be subject to multiple and aggravated forms of discrimination and are still largely invisible in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Millennium Development Goals, and noting that, while progress has already been made by Governments, the international community and the United Nations system in mainstreaming disability as an integral part of the development agenda, major challenges do remain,
	Concerned that the continuing lack of reliable data and information on disability and the situation of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and global levels contributes to the invisibility of persons with disabilities in official statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving disability-inclusive development planning and implementation,
	Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics,7 encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities, and underlining the need to have internationally comparable data to assess progress on disability-inclusive development policies,
	1.	Welcomes the holding of the high-level meeting of the General Assembly, at the level of Heads of State and Government, on 23 September 2013, with the overarching theme "The way forward: a disability-inclusive development agenda towards 2015 and beyond", in order to strengthen efforts to ensure accessibility for and inclusion of persons with disabilities in all aspects of development, and looks forward to the contribution its outcome document could make in mainstreaming the rights of persons with disabilities in the development agenda beyond 2015;
	2.	Also welcomes the report of the Secretary-General entitled "Realization of the Millennium Development Goals and internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities: a disability-inclusive development agenda towards 2015 and beyond",8 and the recommendations contained therein;
	3.	Urges Member States, international and regional organizations, regional integration organizations and financial institutions to make a concerted effort to include persons with disabilities and integrate the principles of accessibility and inclusion in the monitoring and evaluation of the development goals;
	4.	Encourages the mobilization of resources on a sustainable basis to mainstream disability in development at all levels, and in this regard underlines the need to promote and strengthen international cooperation, including South-South and triangular cooperation, in support of national efforts, including, as appropriate, through the establishment of national mechanisms, in particular in developing countries;
	5. 	Welcomes the establishment of the United Nations Partnership to Promote the Rights of Persons with Disabilities trust fund, and encourages Member States and other stakeholders to support its objectives, including by providing voluntary contributions;
	6.	Requests the United Nations system to facilitate technical assistance, within existing resources, including the provision of assistance for capacity-building and for the collection and compilation of national and regional data and statistics on disability, in particular to developing countries, and in this regard requests the Secretary-General, in accordance with existing guidelines on disability statistics, to analyse, publish and disseminate disability data and statistics in future periodic reports, as appropriate, on the realization of the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities;
	7.	Encourages Member States, United Nations organizations and the regional commissions to make all efforts to engage with and ensure the full and effective participation and inclusion of persons with disabilities and, as appropriate, organizations of persons with disabilities and national human rights institutions, in development processes and decision-making at the local, national, regional and international levels;
	8.	Requests the United Nations system, within existing resources, to update existing methodologies of disability data collection and analysis for persons with disabilities, to obtain internationally comparable data on the situation of persons with disabilities and to regularly include relevant disability data or relevant qualitative facts, as appropriate, in relevant United Nations publications in the field of economic and social development;
	9.	Requests the Secretary-General:
	(a)	To submit information on the implementation of the present resolution to the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session;
	(b)	To submit the outcome of the sixth review and appraisal of the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons1 to the General Assembly no later than June 2013, in advance of and as a contribution to the high-level meeting of the Assembly on the realization of the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities, and in this regard requests all relevant United Nations organizations, through the Secretary-General, to provide an analysis of the overall situation of persons with disabilities within the context of development and in line with the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,3 based on available data and in accordance with their individual competencies and informed by regional consultations with persons with disabilities and organizations of persons with disabilities, as appropriate within existing resources.

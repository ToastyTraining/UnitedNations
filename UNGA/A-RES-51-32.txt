	Recognizing also, as noted in the mid-term review,3 that poverty and unemployment are expected to increase substantially in Africa, leading to the need for African countries and the international community to take urgent measures to attain the objectives of the New Agenda,

	Taking note of the reports of the Secretary-General concerning the mid-term review of the implementation of the New Agenda,4 

	Taking note also of the document of the Organization of African Unity concerning the mid-term review of the implementation of the New Agenda, the outcome of the High-level Seminar on African Development, held at Tokyo on 27 and 28 August 1996, and the submission by the non-governmental organizations,

	Noting the contribution made by individual Governments and intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to the work of the Ad Hoc Committee,

	1.	Adopts the conclusions of the mid-term review of the implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s, consisting of an assessment of the responses and measures to accelerate the implementation of the New Agenda, as set forth in the report of the Ad Hoc Committee of the Whole of the General Assembly for the Mid-term Review of the Implementation of the United Nations New Agenda for the Development of Africa in the 1990s,1 highlighting key areas for priority attention, inter alia:  (a) economic reforms, including the effective mobilization and efficient utilization of domestic resources; (b) the promotion of private sector and foreign direct investment; (c) the intensification of the democratic process and the strengthening of civil society; (d) environment and development; (e) resource flows; (f) solution of Africa's debt problem; (g) trade facilitation and market access; (h) the diversification of African economies; (i) the improvement of physical and institutional infrastructure and social and human resource development; and (j) women in development;

	5.	Recognizes the complementary role of the United Nations System-wide Special Initiative on Africa in the implementation of the New Agenda, including the mobilization of adequate resources, while avoiding unnecessary duplication of activities;

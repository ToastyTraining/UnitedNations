65/228.	Strengthening crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women


	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women1 and the Beijing Declaration2 and Platform for Action3 adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women, and, in particular, the determination of Governments to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women,
	Reaffirming also the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development,4 as well as the outcome of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century"5 and the declarations adopted at the forty-ninth6 and fifty-fourth7 sessions of the Commission on the Status of Women,
	Recognizing that the term "women", except where otherwise specified, encompasses "girl children",
	Reaffirming the obligation of all States to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms, and reaffirming that discrimination on the basis of sex is contrary to the Charter of the United Nations, the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women8 and other international human rights instruments and that its elimination is an integral part of efforts towards the elimination of all forms of violence against women,
	Stressing that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent and investigate acts of violence against women and girls and punish the perpetrators, eliminate impunity and provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms,
	Emphasizing the importance of preventing violence against migrant women through the implementation, inter alia, of measures aimed at combating racism, xenophobia and related forms of intolerance,

	Recognizing that women's poverty and lack of empowerment, as well as their marginalization resulting from their exclusion from social policies and from the benefits of sustained development, can place them at increased risk of violence and that violence against women impedes the social and economic development of communities and States, as well as the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, 
	Reaffirming its resolution 52/86 of 12 December 1997, in which it adopted the Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice,

	Expressing deep concern about the pervasiveness of violence against women in all its forms and manifestations worldwide, and reiterating the need to intensify efforts to address that challenge,
	Recognizing that effective and integrated criminal justice responses to violence against women require close cooperation among all key stakeholders, including law enforcement officials, prosecutors, judges, victim advocates, health professionals and forensic scientists,
	Stressing the importance of a comprehensive, well-coordinated, effective and adequately resourced response by the United Nations system to all forms of violence against women,
	Recalling the joint dialogue of the Commission on the Status of Women and the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice on addressing violence against women through legal reform, held in New York on 4 March 2009 within the framework of the fifty-third session of the Commission on the Status of Women,
	Recalling also Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice decision 17/1 of 18 April 2008,13 in which the Commission requested the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to convene an intergovernmental group of experts with equitable geographical representation, in cooperation with the institutes of the United Nations crime prevention and criminal justice programme network, the Commission on the Status of Women and the Special Rapporteur on violence against women, its causes and consequences, to review and update, as appropriate, the Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice,

Annex
Updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice

Preamble
1.	The multifaceted nature of violence against women necessitates different strategies to respond to the diverse manifestations of violence and the various settings in which it occurs, both in private and in public life, whether committed in the home, the workplace, educational and training institutions, the community or society, in custody or in situations of armed conflict or natural disaster. In the updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, the importance of adopting a systematic, comprehensive, coordinated, multisectoral and sustained approach to fighting violence against women is recognized. The practical measures, strategies and activities described below can be introduced in the field of crime prevention and criminal justice to address violence against women. Except where otherwise specified, the term "women" encompasses "girl children".
2.	Violence against women exists in every country in the world as a pervasive violation of human rights and a major impediment to achieving gender equality, development and peace. Violence against women is rooted in historically unequal power relations between men and women. All forms of violence against women seriously violate and impair or nullify the enjoyment by women of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and have serious immediate and long-term implications for health, including sexual and reproductive health, for example through increased vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, and public safety, and have a negative impact on the psychological, social and economic development of individuals, families, communities and States.
3.	Violence against women is often embedded in and supported by social values, cultural patterns and practices. The criminal justice system and legislators are not immune to such values and thus have not always regarded violence against women with the same seriousness as other types of violence. Therefore, it is important that States strongly condemn all forms of violence against women and refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligation with respect to its elimination and that the criminal justice system recognize violence against women as a gender-related problem and as an expression of power and inequality. 
4.	Violence against women is defined in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women1 and reiterated in the Platform for Action adopted by the Fourth World Conference on Women3to mean any act of gender-based violence that results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring in public or in private life. The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures build on the measures adopted by Governments in the Platform for Action, which was adopted in 1995 and subsequently reaffirmed in 2000 and 2005, the Model Strategies and Practical Measures on the Elimination of Violence against Women in the Field of Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice adopted in 1997,17 and relevant General Assembly resolutions, including resolutions 61/143 and 63/155, bearing in mind that some groups of women are especially exposed and vulnerable to violence.
5.	The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures specifically acknowledge the need for an active policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective in all policies, programmes and practices to ensure gender equality and equal and fair access to justice, as well as establishing the goal of gender balance in all areas of decision-making, including those related to the elimination of violence against women. The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures should be applied as guidelines in a manner consistent with relevant international instruments, including the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,8 the Convention on the Rights of the Child,18 the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography,19 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,20 the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,21 the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court12 and the Guidelines for the Prevention of Crime,10 with a view to furthering their fair and effective implementation. The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures reaffirm the commitment of States to promote gender equality and empower women with a view to meeting Goal 3 of the Millennium Development Goals.
6.	The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures should be endorsed by national legislation and implemented by Member States and other entities in a manner consistent with the right to equality before the law, while also recognizing that gender equality may sometimes require the adoption of different approaches that acknowledge the different ways in which violence affects women as compared to men. Member States should ensure that women have equal protection under the law and equal access to justice in order to facilitate efforts by Governments to prevent and sanction acts of violence against women through comprehensive and coordinated policies and strategies, and to deal with all forms of violence against women within the criminal justice system.
7.	The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women must be focused on the needs of victims and empower individual women who are victims of violence. They aim to ensure that prevention and intervention efforts are made to not only stop and appropriately sanction violence against women, but also restore a sense of dignity and control to the victims of such violence.
8.	The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures aim to contribute to de jure and de facto equality between women and men. They do not give preferential treatment to women but aim to ensure that any inequalities or forms of discrimination that women face in accessing justice, particularly in respect of acts of violence, are redressed.
9.	The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that sexual violence is an issue of international peace and security, as outlined in Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 and 1820 (2008) of 19 June 2008 on women and peace and security, particularly the need for parties to armed conflict to adopt prevention and protection measures in order to end sexual violence.
10.	The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that some special groups of women are particularly vulnerable to violence, either because of their nationality, ethnicity, religion or language or because they belong to an indigenous group, are migrants, are stateless, are refugees, live in underdeveloped, rural or remote communities, are homeless, are in institutions or in detention, have disabilities, are elderly, are widowed or live in conflict, post-conflict or disaster situations and, as such, require special attention, intervention and protection in the development of crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women.
11.	The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize advances in crime prevention and criminal justice responses to violence against women and the importance of investing in the prevention of violence against women.
12.	The updated Model Strategies and Practical Measures recognize that States have the obligation to promote and protect the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all people, including women, and that they must exercise due diligence and take relevant measures to prevent, investigate and punish the perpetrators of violence against women, to eliminate impunity and to provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of women's human rights and fundamental freedoms.

	(e)	To review and, where appropriate, revise, amend or abolish any laws, regulations, policies, practices and customs that discriminate against women or have a discriminatory impact on women, and to ensure that provisions of multiple legal systems, where they exist, comply with international human rights obligations, commitments and principles, in particular the principle of non-discrimination.

50/231.Proposals on possible means of absorption of the cost of new mandates within the programme budget for 1996-1997

	The General Assembly,

	Reaffirming the budgetary process as adopted in its resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986 and subsequent relevant resolutions,

	Recalling its resolutions 50/214 and 50/215 of 23 December 1995,

	Reaffirming also that changes in mandated programmes and activities are the prerogative of the General Assembly,

	Recalling its authorizations for the Secretary-General to enter into commitments in 1996 in respect of newly mandated activities in Haiti, Guatemala, El Salvador and Rwanda, 1/

	Recalling also its requests that the Secretary-General provide a report, no later than 15 May 1996, on possible means of absorption of the related costs within the programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997, 1/

	Recognizing that the expenditures relating to the newly mandated activities in Haiti, Guatemala, El Salvador and Rwanda are extraordinary in nature and are governed by the procedures specified in paragraph 11 of annex I to resolution 41/213,

	Noting that it has approved commitment authority amounting to 24.7 million United States dollars for activities in Haiti, Guatemala, El Salvador and Rwanda in 1996,



	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on possible means of absorption, 2/

	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;

	2.	Notes that the Secretary-General stated in his report that he could not absorb any additional amount beyond the reductions of 154 million dollars required to maintain expenditures within the approved appropriations and that he anticipated that new approved and prospective mandates might require an additional 120 million dollars during the course of the biennium;

	3.	Reiterates that the authority of the Secretary-General to implement any proposal to change mandated programmes and activities is subject to the prior approval of the General Assembly;

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General, subject to the full implementation of all mandated programmes and activities as required by its resolution 50/214, to submit a report to the General Assembly no later than 1 September 1996 containing proposals on possible means of absorption in the programme budget for the biennium 1996-1997, including, inter alia, in part II thereof and in the area of staff costs where savings might arise from the implementation of the early separation programme during the biennium;

	5.	Decides to revert to the issue of appropriations in the context of the first performance report;

	6.	Authorizes the Secretary-General, in responding to the requirements of resolution 50/86 B of 3 April 1996 concerning Haiti, to enter into further commitments of 1,767,300 dollars gross (1,606,200 dollars net of staff assessment) for the period from 1 June to 31 August 1996;

	7.	Also authorizes the Secretary-General, should the General Assembly decide to extend the mandate of the International Civilian Mission to Haiti beyond 31 August 1996, to enter into commitments up to the end of December 1996 in an amount not exceeding a monthly level of 627,900 dollars gross (567,700 dollars net of staff assessment).

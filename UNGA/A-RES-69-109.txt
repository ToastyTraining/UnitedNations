	Reaffirming the importance of sustainable aquaculture to food security, and concerned about the potential effects of genetically engineered aquatic fish species on the health and sustainability of wild fish stocks,
	Calling attention to the particular vulnerabilities of small island developing States, other developing coastal States and subsistence fishing communities whose livelihoods, economic development and food security are heavily dependent on sustainable fisheries and will suffer disproportionately if sustainable fisheries are negatively affected,
	Welcoming in this regard the third International Conference on Small Island Developing States, held in Apia from 1 to 4 September 2014, which focused on small island developing States as a special case for sustainable development, in view of their unique and particular vulnerabilities, and considered, inter alia, issues of sustainable fisheries, and calling for the full implementation in this regard of the outcome document, entitled "SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway",9

[on the report of the First Committee (A/71/450)]
71/72.	Countering the threat posed by improvised explosive devices


	The General Assembly, 
	Recalling its resolution 70/46 of 7 December 2015, 
	Expressing grave concern over the devastation caused by the increasing use of improvised explosive devices by illegal armed groups, terrorists and other unauthorized recipients,1 which has affected a large number of countries and has resulted in thousands of casualties, both civilian and military, 
	Expressing concern at the serious harm that such improvised explosive device attacks have caused to United Nations staff and peacekeepers, and to humanitarian workers, by threatening their lives, increasing the cost of their activities, limiting their freedom of movement and affecting their ability to deliver on their mandates, 
	Expressing concern also about the negative impact of these attacks on socioeconomic development, infrastructure and freedom of movement, and the security and stability of States, and thus underlining the need to address this issue in order to achieve relevant goals and targets under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,2 in particular target 16.1 on significantly reducing all forms of violence and related death rates everywhere, 
	Recognizing that the wide spectrum of materials that can be used for the manufacture of improvised explosive devices, including those sourced from the military and civilian industry, contributes to their diverse nature and their deployment methods, which thus requires an appropriate approach to the formulation of measures to counter them, 
	Noting that the impact of improvised explosive devices spans a wide array of policy areas and that, owing to the extent of the cross-cutting nature of the issue, a whole-of-government approach focusing on the capacity of Governments to effectively bring together several policy strands for comprehensive action is essential, 
	Underlining the important role that States can play in raising awareness among private sector entities about the possible theft, diversion and misuse of their products to make improvised explosive devices, with a view to enabling business entities to develop effective strategies to counter the threat of improvised explosive devices,3 including to prevent the adverse impact of the diversion of materials and the potential loss of revenue and risk to reputation, 
	Noting the contribution of good governance, the promotion of human rights, the rule of law and sustained and inclusive socioeconomic growth, including through effective measures and mechanisms for persons belonging to vulnerable groups, as important elements in comprehensively addressing the issue of improvised explosive devices, in particular in post-conflict situations, 
	Stressing the paramount need to prevent illegal armed groups, terrorists and other unauthorized recipients from, and identify the networks that support them in, obtaining, handling, financing, storing, using or seeking access to all types of explosives, whether military or civilian, as well as other military or civilian materials and components that can be used to manufacture improvised explosive devices, including detonators, detonating cords and chemical components, while at the same time avoiding any undue restrictions on the legitimate use of those materials, 
	Stressing also the importance of securing conventional ammunition stockpiles in order to mitigate the risk of their diversion to illicit use as materials for improvised explosive devices, 
	Stressing further the importance of engagement by all Member States in a comprehensive and coordinated community of action to counter the global threat posed by improvised explosive devices in the hands of illegal armed groups, terrorists and other unauthorized recipients, taking into account national capacities, 
	Noting that, at the global level, organizations across many sectors have expertise that can contribute to a useful set of measures for the mitigation of improvised explosive devices, and noting also the value of considered and coordinated efforts by various stakeholders, including intergovernmental organizations, with a view to investing effectively in coordination and information exchange, 
	Noting also the discussions on the issue of improvised explosive devices by the informal group of experts under the Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby Traps and Other Devices as amended on 3 May 1996 (Amended Protocol II)4 and on the technical annex to the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War (Protocol V)5 to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects,6 
	Noting further the multilateral efforts to counter improvised explosive devices of the Programme Global Shield, led by the World Customs Organization and assisted by the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL) and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, to prevent the smuggling and illicit diversion of precursor chemicals that could be used to build improvised explosive devices, the network of regional and multilateral communities of action established by States to counter improvised explosive devices, the research on those devices undertaken by the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research and the work undertaken by the Mine Action Service of the United Nations to mitigate the threat posed by those devices to civilians, United Nations staff, peacekeepers and humanitarian personnel, in particular in the field, 
	Taking note of the International Convention for the Suppression of Terrorist Bombings7 and the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy,8 
	Reaffirming the inherent right of Member States to individual or collective self-defence in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, 
	1.	Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General submitted pursuant to resolution 70/46,9 and takes note of the recommendations contained therein; 
	2.	Recognizes that existing approaches in multilateral arms regulation, while valuable, do not fully address the issue of improvised explosive devices, and therefore strongly urges States to develop and implement, where appropriate, all national measures, including outreach and partnerships with relevant actors, including the private sector, necessary to promote awareness and vigilance among their nationals, persons subject to their jurisdiction and firms incorporated in their territory or subject to their jurisdiction that are involved in the production, sale, supply, purchase, transfer and/or storage of precursor components and materials that could be used to make improvised explosive devices; 
	3.	Strongly encourages States, where appropriate, to develop and adopt their own national policy to counter improvised explosive devices that includes civilian-military cooperation, to strengthen their countermeasure capability, to prevent their territory from being used for terrorist purposes and to combat illegal armed groups, terrorists and other unauthorized recipients in their use of improvised explosive devices, while bearing in mind their obligations under applicable international law, and notes that the policy could include measures to support international and regional efforts to prevent, protect against, respond to, recover from and mitigate attacks using improvised explosive devices and their widespread consequences; 
	4.	Stresses the need for States to take appropriate measures to strengthen the management of their national ammunition stockpiles to prevent the diversion of materials for making improvised explosive devices to illicit markets, illegal armed groups, terrorists and other unauthorized recipients, and encourages the application of the International Ammunition Technical Guidelines for the safer and more secure management of ammunition stockpiles, while also recognizing the importance of capacity-building in this regard;10 
	5.	Underlines that, for the issue of improvised explosive devices to be effectively addressed, it is essential to comprehend the importance of action needed at the local and community levels; through activities ranging from awareness-raising with local retailers and intelligence-gathering to establishing deradicalization programmes, Governments will need to engage continuously with local authorities and groups;

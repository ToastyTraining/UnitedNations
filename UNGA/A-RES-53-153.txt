    The General Assembly,


    Guided by the fundamental and universal principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 article 26 of which states that "education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms", and the provisions of other international human rights instruments, such as those of article 13 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,2 article 10 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,3 article 7 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,4 article 29 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child,5 article 10 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment6 and paragraphs 78 to 82 of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993,7 which reflect the aims of the aforementioned article,

    Recalling the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly and the Commission on Human Rights concerning the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education, 1995-2004, public information activities in the field of human rights, including the World Public Information Campaign on Human Rights, the project of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization entitled "Towards a culture of peace", the implementation of and follow-up to the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action and the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,

    Believing that the World Public Information Campaign  is a valuable complement to the activities of the United Nations aimed at the further promotion and protection of human rights, and recalling the importance attached by the World Conference on Human Rights to human rights education and information,

    Convinced that every woman, man, youth and child, in order to realize their full human potential, must be made aware of all their human rights and fundamental freedoms,

    Convinced also that human rights education should involve more than the provision of information and should constitute a comprehensive, lifelong process by which people at all levels of development and in all societies learn respect for the dignity of others and the means and methods of ensuring that respect,

    Recognizing that human rights education and information are essential to the realization of human rights and fundamental freedoms and that carefully designed training, dissemination and information programmes can have a catalytic effect on national, regional and international initiatives to promote and protect human rights and prevent human rights violations,

    Convinced that human rights education and information contribute to a holistic concept of development consistent with the dignity of women and men of all ages, which takes into account particularly vulnerable segments of society such as children, young persons, older persons, indigenous people, minorities, the rural and urban poor, migrant workers, refugees, persons with the human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome  and disabled persons,

    Taking into account the efforts to promote human rights education made by educators and non-governmental organizations in all parts of the world, as well as by intergovernmental organizations, including the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the International Labour Organization, the United Nations Children's Fund and the United Nations Development Programme,

    Recognizing the invaluable and creative role that non-governmental and community-based organizations can play in disseminating public information and engaging in human rights education, especially at the grass-roots level and in remote and rural communities,


    Aware of the potential supportive role of the private sector in implementing at all levels of society the Plan of Action for the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education, 1995-2004,8 and the World Public Information Campaign, through creative initiatives and financial support for governmental and non-governmental activities,

    Convinced that the effectiveness of existing human rights education and public information activities would be enhanced by better coordination and cooperation at the national, regional and international levels,

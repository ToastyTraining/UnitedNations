	The General Assembly,

	Reaffirming that the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action1 and the further initiatives for social development adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session,2 as well as a continued global dialogue on social development issues, constitute the basic framework for the promotion of social development for all at the national and international levels,
	Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration3 and the development goals contained therein, as well as the commitments made at major United Nations summits, conferences and special sessions, including the commitments made at the 2005 World Summit,4
	Recalling also its resolution 57/270 B of 23 June 2003 on the integrated and coordinated implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic and social fields,
	Recalling further its resolution 60/209 of 22 December 2005 on the implementation of the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006),
	Noting with appreciation the ministerial declaration adopted at the high-level segment of the substantive session of 2006 of the Economic and Social Council, on "Creating an environment at the national and international levels conducive to generating full and productive employment and decent work for all, and its impact on sustainable development",5
	Noting that the decent work agenda of the International Labour Organization, with its four strategic objectives, has an important role to play, as reaffirmed in the International Labour Organization Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization,6 in achieving the objective of full and productive employment and decent work for all,
	Emphasizing the need to enhance the role of the Commission for Social Development in the follow-up and review of the World Summit for Social Development and the outcome of the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly,
	Recognizing that a people-centred approach must be at the centre of economic and social development,
	Expressing deep concern that attainment of the social development objectives can be hindered by instability in global and national financial markets as well as challenges brought about by the ongoing food and energy crises,
	Affirming its strong support for fair globalization and the need to translate growth into eradication of poverty and commitment to strategies and policies that aim to promote full, freely chosen and productive employment and decent work for all and that these should constitute a fundamental component of relevant national and international policies as well as national development strategies, including poverty reduction strategies, and reaffirming that employment creation and decent work should be incorporated into macroeconomic policies, taking fully into account the impact and social dimension of globalization, the benefits and costs of which are often unevenly shared and distributed,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;7
	2.	Welcomes the reaffirmation by Governments of their will and commitment to continue implementing the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action,1 in particular to eradicate poverty, promote full and productive employment and foster social integration to achieve stable, safe and just societies for all;
	3.	Recognizes that the implementation of the Copenhagen commitments and the attainment of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, are mutually reinforcing and that the Copenhagen commitments are crucial to a coherent people-centred approach to development;
	4.	Reaffirms that the Commission for Social Development continues to have the primary responsibility for the follow-up and review of the World Summit for Social Development and the outcome of the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly and that it serves as the main United Nations forum for an intensified global dialogue on social development issues, and calls upon Member States, the relevant specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system and civil society to enhance their support for its work;
	5.	Recognizes that the broad concept of social development affirmed by the World Summit for Social Development and the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly has been weakened in national and international policymaking and that, while poverty eradication is a central part of development policy and discourse, further attention should be given to the other commitments agreed to at the Summit, in particular those concerning employment and social integration, which have also suffered from a general disconnect between economic and social policymaking;
	6.	Acknowledges that the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006), launched after the World Summit for Social Development, has provided the long-term vision for sustained and concerted efforts at the national and international levels to eradicate poverty;
	7.	Recognizes that the implementation of the commitments made by Governments during the first Decade has fallen short of expectations, and welcomes the proclamation of the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2008-2017) by the General Assembly in its resolution 62/205 of 19 December 2007 in order to support, in an efficient and coordinated manner, the internationally agreed development goals related to poverty eradication, including the Millennium Development Goals;
	8.

	10.	Stresses that an enabling environment is a critical precondition for achieving equity and social development and that, while economic growth is essential, entrenched inequality and marginalization are an obstacle to the broad-based and sustained growth required for sustainable, inclusive, people-centred development, and recognizes the need to balance and ensure complementarity between measures to achieve growth and measures to achieve economic and social equity in order for there to be an impact on overall poverty levels;
	11.	Also stresses that stability in global financial systems and corporate social responsibility and accountability, as well as national economic policies that have an impact on other stakeholders, are essential in creating an enabling international environment to promote economic growth and social development;

	16.	Reaffirms that there is an urgent need to create an environment at the national and international levels that is conducive to the attainment of full and productive employment and decent work for all as a foundation for sustainable development and that an environment that supports investment, growth and entrepreneurship is essential to the creation of new job opportunities, and also reaffirms that opportunities for men and women to obtain productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity are essential to ensuring the eradication of hunger and poverty, the improvement of economic and social well-being for all, the achievement of sustained economic growth and sustainable development of all nations and a fully inclusive and equitable globalization;

Stresses the importance of removing obstacles to the realization of the right of peoples to self-determination, in particular of peoples living under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation, which adversely affect their social and economic development, including their exclusion from labour markets;
	18.	Reaffirms that violence, in its many manifestations, including domestic violence, especially against women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities, is a growing threat to the security of individuals, families and communities everywhere; total social breakdown is an all too real contemporary experience; organized crime, illegal drugs, the illicit arms trade, trafficking in women and children, ethnic and religious conflict, civil war, terrorism, all forms of extremist violence, xenophobia, and politically motivated killing and even genocide present fundamental threats to societies and the global social order; they also present compelling and urgent reasons for action by Governments individually and, as appropriate, jointly to foster social cohesion while recognizing, protecting and valuing diversity;
	19.	Calls upon the organizations of the United Nations system to commit to mainstreaming the goal of full and productive employment and decent work for all in their policies, programmes and activities;
	20.	Requests the United Nations funds, programmes and agencies and invites financial institutions to support efforts to mainstream the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all in their policies, programmes and activities;
	21.	Recognizes that promoting full employment and decent work also requires investing in education, training and skills development for women and men, and girls and boys, strengthening social protection and health systems and applying labour standards;
	22.	Also recognizes that full and productive employment and decent work for all, which encompass social protection, fundamental principles and rights at work and social dialogue, are key elements of sustainable development for all countries and are therefore a priority objective of international cooperation;
	23.	Stresses that policies and strategies to achieve full employment and decent work for all should include specific measures to promote gender equality and foster social integration for social groups such as youth, persons with disabilities, and older persons, as well as migrants and indigenous peoples;

Acknowledges the important nexus between international migration and social development, and stresses the importance of enforcing labour law effectively with regard to migrant workers' labour relations and working conditions, inter alia, those related to their remuneration and conditions of health, safety at work and the right to freedom of association;
	29.	Reaffirms that social integration policies should seek to reduce inequalities, promote access to basic social services, education for all and health care, increase the participation and integration of social groups, particularly youth, older persons and persons with disabilities, and address the challenges posed by globalization and market-driven reforms to social development in order for all people in all countries to benefit from globalization;

	33.	Acknowledges the important role that the public sector can play as an employer and in developing an environment that enables the effective generation of full and productive employment and decent work for all;
	34.	Also acknowledges the vital role that the private sector can play in generating new investments, employment and financing for development and in advancing efforts towards full employment and decent work;
	35.	Recognizes that the majority of poor people live and work in rural areas, that priority should be given to agricultural and non-farm sectors and that steps should be taken to anticipate and offset the negative social and economic consequences of globalization and to maximize its benefits for poor people living and working in rural areas;

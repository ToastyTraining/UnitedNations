	Recalling the several appeals made by the General Assembly to all Afghan parties to protect the cultural and historic relics and monuments in Afghanistan, and welcoming recent calls by the Security Council, the United Nations Special Mission to Afghanistan, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and others, urging the Taliban to halt their destruction,
	Noting that the destruction of the statues in Afghanistan, in particular of the unique Buddhist sculptures in Bamiyan, would be an irreparable loss for humanity as a whole,
	1.	Strongly calls upon the Taliban to abide by their previous commitments to protect the cultural heritage of Afghanistan from all acts of vandalism, damage and theft;
	2.	Strongly urges the Taliban to review their edict of 26 February 2001 and to stop its implementation;
	3.	Also strongly urges the Taliban to take immediate action to prevent the further destruction of the irreplaceable relics, monuments or artefacts of the cultural heritage of Afghanistan;
	4.	Calls upon Member States to help, through appropriate technical measures, to safeguard the sculptures, including, if necessary, their temporary relocation or removal from public view.

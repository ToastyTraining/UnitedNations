	Recalling the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,
	Particularly concerned that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing continues to constitute a serious threat to fish stocks and marine habitats and ecosystems, to the detriment of sustainable fisheries as well as the food security and the economies of many States, particularly developing States,
	Concerned that some operators increasingly take advantage of the globalization of fishery markets to trade fishery products stemming from illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and make economic profits from those operations, which constitutes an incentive for them to pursue their activities,
	Recognizing that effective deterrence and combating of illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has significant financial and other resource implications,

	Concerned that marine pollution from all sources constitutes a serious threat to human health and safety, endangers fish stocks, marine biodiversity and marine and coastal habitats and has significant costs to local and national economies,
	Recognizing that marine debris is a global transboundary pollution problem and that, owing to the many different types and sources of marine debris, different approaches to its prevention and removal are necessary, including identification of such sources and environmentally sound techniques for its removal, and noting that the United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea focused its discussions at its seventeenth meeting, held from 13 to 17 June 2016, on marine debris, plastics and microplastics, 
	Recognizing also that abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded fishing gear, including ghost fishing gear, is an increasingly pervasive and destructive form of marine debris causing adverse impacts on fish stocks, marine life and the marine environment and that urgent preventative action is needed, such as marking of fishing gear as proposed by the Committee on Fisheries, as well as removal action,
	Reaffirming the importance of sustainable aquaculture to food security, noting that aquaculture is already making a significant contribution to the global seafood supply and that a further increase in that contribution is anticipated,
	Noting that the contribution of sustainable aquaculture to global fish supplies continues to respond to opportunities in developing countries to enhance local food security and nutrition and poverty alleviation and, together with the efforts of other aquaculture-producing countries, will make a significant contribution to meeting future demands in fish consumption, bearing in mind article 9 of the Code,

	Recognizing the need to adopt, implement and enforce appropriate measures to minimize waste, by-catch and discards, including high-grading, loss of fishing gear and other factors that adversely affect the sustainability of fish stocks and ecosystems and, consequently, can also have harmful effects on the economies and food security of small island developing States, other developing coastal States and subsistence fishing communities,
	Recognizing also the need to further integrate ecosystem approaches into fisheries conservation and management and, more generally, the importance of applying ecosystem approaches to the management of human activities in the ocean, and noting in this regard the Reykjavik Declaration on Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem,11 the work of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations related to guidelines for the implementation of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management and the importance of this approach to relevant provisions of the Agreement and the Code, as well as decision VII/1112 and other relevant decisions of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity,
	Recognizing further the economic and cultural importance of sharks in many countries, the biological importance of sharks in the marine ecosystem as key predatory species, the vulnerability of certain shark species to overexploitation, the fact that some are threatened with extinction, the need for measures to promote the long-term conservation, management and sustainable use of shark populations and fisheries, and the relevance of the International Plan of Action for the Conservation and Management of Sharks, adopted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 1999, in providing guidance on the development of such measures,

	Noting with concern that basic data on shark stocks and harvests continue to be lacking and that not all regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements have adopted conservation and management measures for directed shark fisheries and for the regulation of by-catch of sharks from other fisheries,
	Welcoming science-based measures taken by States to conserve and sustainably manage sharks, and noting in this respect management measures taken by coastal States, including limits on catch or fishing effort, technical measures, including by-catch reduction measures, sanctuaries, closed seasons and areas and monitoring, control and surveillance,
	Noting the decisions on sharks and rays adopted at the seventeenth meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, held in Johannesburg, South Africa, from 24 September to 5 October 2016, inter alia, the inclusion of additional species of sharks and rays in appendix II to that Convention,13 and recalling the ongoing work of the secretariat of that Convention and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations on capacity-building in this regard,
	Recalling that the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, in 2014, listed 21 species of sharks and rays under the appendices to that Convention,14
	Noting with concern the continuing practice of the removal of fins from sharks, with the remainder of the carcass being discarded at sea,
	Recognizing the importance of marine species occupying low trophic levels in the ecosystem and for food security, and the need to ensure their long-term sustainability,
	Expressing concern over continued incidental mortality, in fishing operations, of seabirds, particularly albatrosses and petrels, as well as other marine species, including sharks, fin-fish species, marine mammals and marine turtles, while recognizing considerable efforts by States and through various regional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to reduce incidental mortality as a result of by-catch,

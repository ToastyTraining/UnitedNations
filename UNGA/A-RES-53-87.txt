Reaffirms the necessity for humanitarian personnel and United Nations personnel to be properly informed, inter alia, by their sponsoring organizations of the scope of their activities and the standards that they are required to meet, including those contained in relevant domestic and international law, and suitably trained so as to enhance their security and effectiveness in accomplishing their functions;

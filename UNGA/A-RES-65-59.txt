	Recognizing that the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in its final document,5 encouraged the establishment of further nuclear-weapon-free zones, and expressing the hope that this encouragement will be followed by concerted international efforts to create nuclear-weapon-free zones in areas in the world where they do not currently exist, especially in the Middle East,

	Welcoming further the Agreement between the Russian Federation and the United States of America concerning the Management and Disposition of Plutonium Designated as No Longer Required for Defence Purposes and their commitment to conclude legally binding agreements with the International Atomic Energy Agency to implement verification measures,
	Recalling that the 2010 Review Conference reaffirmed and recognized that the total elimination of nuclear weapons is the only absolute guarantee against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons and the legitimate interest of non-nuclear-weapon States in receiving unequivocal and legally binding security assurances from nuclear-weapon States,

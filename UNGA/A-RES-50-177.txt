	The General Assembly,

	Guided by the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1/

	Considering the World Plan of Action on Education for Human Rights and Democracy, 5/ adopted by the International Congress on Education for Human Rights and Democracy convened by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization at Montreal from 8 to 11 March 1993, according to which education for human rights and democracy is itself a human right and a prerequisite for the realization of human rights, democracy and social justice,

	Bearing in mind the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993, 6/ in particular section II, paragraphs 78 to 82 thereof,

	Recalling that it is the responsibility of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to coordinate relevant United Nations education and public information programmes in the field of human rights,

	Recalling its resolution 49/184 of 23 December 1994, by which it proclaimed the ten-year period beginning on 1 January 1995 the United Nations Decade for Human Rights Education, welcomed the Plan of Action for the Decade, 7/ and requested the High Commissioner to coordinate the implementation of the Plan of Action,

	Taking note of the report of the High Commissioner to the General Assembly, 8/ in which he stated that human rights education was essential for the encouragement of harmonious intercommunity relations, for mutual tolerance and understanding and, finally, for peace,

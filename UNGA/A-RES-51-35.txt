	1.	Recognizes the significance of the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks1 as an important contribution to ensuring the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks;

	3.	Calls upon all States and other entities referred to in article 1, paragraph 2 (b), of the Agreement that have not done so to ratify or accede to it and to consider applying it provisionally;

	4.	Takes note with concern that many commercially important straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks have been subject to heavy and little-regulated fishing efforts and that some stocks continue to be overfished;

	5.	Welcomes the fact that a growing number of States and other entities, as well as regional and subregional fishery management organizations and arrangements, have adopted legislation, established regulations or taken other measures to implement the provisions in the Agreement, and urges them to enforce those measures fully;  

	6.	Calls upon States and other entities and regional and subregional fishery management organizations and arrangements that have not done so to consider taking measures to implement the provisions of the Agreement;

	7.	Urges States, relevant specialized agencies, international organizations, intergovernmental bodies and non-governmental organizations that have not yet done so to provide information to the Secretary-General to ensure as comprehensive a report as possible; 

	8.	Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session and biennially thereafter on further developments relating to the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, including the status and implementation of the Agreement, taking into account information provided by States, relevant specialized agencies, in particular the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, and other appropriate organs, organizations and programmes of the United Nations system, regional and subregional organizations and arrangements for the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, as well as other relevant intergovernmental bodies and non-governmental organizations;


	9.	Also requests the Secretary-General to ensure that reporting on all major fishery-related activities and instruments is effectively coordinated and duplication of activities and reporting minimized, and that relevant scientific and technical studies are disseminated to the international community, and invites the relevant specialized agencies, including the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, as well as regional and subregional fishery organizations and arrangements, to cooperate with the Secretary-General to that end;

	10.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-second session, under an item entitled "Oceans and law of the sea", the sub-item entitled "Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks".

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 20 December 2012
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/67/450 and Corr.1)]
67/146.	Intensifying global efforts for the elimination of female genital mutilations


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 53/117 of 9 December 1998 and 56/128 of 19 December 2001, Commission on the Status of Women resolutions 51/2 of 9 March 2007,1 52/2 of 7 March 20082 and 54/7 of 12 March 20103 and all other relevant resolutions,
	Reaffirming that the Convention on the Rights of the Child4 and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,5 together with the Optional Protocols thereto,6 constitute an important contribution to the legal framework for the protection and promotion of the human rights of women and girls,
	Reaffirming also the Beijing Declaration7 and Platform for Action,8 the outcomes of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century",9 the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development10 and the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development11 and their 5-year, 10-year and 15-year reviews, as well as the United Nations Millennium Declaration12 and the commitments relevant to women and girls made at the 2005 World Summit13 and reiterated in Assembly resolution 65/1 of 22 September 2010, entitled "Keeping the promise: united to achieve the Millennium Development Goals",
	Recalling the Protocol to the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights on the Rights of Women in Africa, adopted in Maputo on 11 July 2003, which contains, inter alia, undertakings and commitments on ending female genital mutilation and marks a significant milestone towards the abandonment and ending of female genital mutilation,
	Recalling also the decision of the African Union, adopted in Malabo on 1 July 2011, to support the adoption by the General Assembly at its sixty-sixth session of a resolution banning female genital mutilation,
	Recalling further the recommendation of the Commission on the Status of Women at its fifty-sixth session that the Economic and Social Council recommend to the General Assembly the adoption of a decision to consider the issue of ending female genital mutilation at its sixty-seventh session under the agenda item entitled "Advancement of women",14
	Recognizing that female genital mutilations are an irreparable, irreversible abuse that impacts negatively on the human rights of women and girls, affecting about 100 million to 140 million women and girls worldwide, and that each year an estimated further 3 million girls are at risk of being subjected to the practice throughout the world,
	Reaffirming that female genital mutilations are a harmful practice that constitutes a serious threat to the health of women and girls, including their psychological, sexual and reproductive health, which can increase their vulnerability to HIV and may have adverse obstetric and prenatal outcomes as well as fatal consequences for the mother and the newborn, and that the abandonment of this harmful practice can be achieved as a result of a comprehensive movement that involves all public and private stakeholders in society, including girls and boys, women and men,
	Concerned about evidence of an increase in the incidence of female genital mutilations being carried out by medical personnel in all regions in which they 
are practised,
	Recognizing that negative discriminatory stereotypical attitudes and behaviours have direct implications for the status and treatment of women and girls and that such negative stereotypes impede the implementation of legislative and normative frameworks that guarantee gender equality and prohibit discrimination on the basis of sex,
	Recognizing also that the campaign of the Secretary-General entitled "UNiTE to End Violence against Women" and the database on violence against women will contribute to addressing the elimination of female genital mutilations,
	Welcoming the efforts of the United Nations system to end female genital mutilations, in particular the commitment of 10 United Nations entities15 announced in their joint inter-agency statement of 27 February 2008 on eliminating female genital mutilation, as well as the Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting: Accelerating Change, of the United Nations Population Fund and the United Nations Children's Fund, to accelerate the elimination of the practice,
	Deeply concerned that, despite the increase in national, regional and international efforts and the focus on the abandonment of female genital mutilations, the practice continues to exist in all regions of the world,
	Deeply concerned also that a tremendous gap in resources continues to exist and that the shortfall in funding has severely limited the scope and pace of programmes and activities for the elimination of female genital mutilations,
	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on ending female genital mutilation,16
	1.	Stresses that the empowerment of women and girls is key to breaking the cycle of discrimination and violence and for the promotion and protection of human rights, including the right to the highest attainable standard of mental and physical health, including sexual and reproductive health, and calls upon States parties to fulfil their obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child4 and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women,5 as well as their commitments to implement the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women,17 the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development,10 the Beijing Platform for Action8 and the outcomes of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century",9 and of the special session of the Assembly on children;18

Also calls upon States to develop unified methods and standards for the collection of data on all forms of discrimination and violence against girls, especially forms that are underdocumented, such as female genital mutilations, and to develop additional indicators to effectively measure progress in eliminating 
the practice;
	14.	Urges States to allocate sufficient resources to the implementation of policies and programmes and legislative frameworks aimed at eliminating female genital mutilations;
	15.	Calls upon States to develop, support and implement comprehensive and integrated strategies for the prevention of female genital mutilations, including the training of social workers, medical personnel, community and religious leaders and relevant professionals, and to ensure that they provide competent, supportive services and care to women and girls who are at risk of or who have undergone female genital mutilations, and encourage them to report to the appropriate authorities cases in which they believe women or girls are at risk;
	16.

	Welcoming the agreed conclusions adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women during its fifty-seventh session,8 and taking note, in particular, of the commitment, as appropriate, to further adopt and implement measures to ensure the social and legal inclusion and protection of women migrants, including women migrant workers in countries of origin, transit and destination, promote and protect the full realization of their human rights and their protection against violence and exploitation, implement gender-sensitive policies and programmes for women migrant workers and provide safe and legal channels that recognize their skills and education, provide fair labour conditions and, as appropriate, facilitate their productive employment and decent work as well as integration into the labour force,
	Recalling the declaration of the United Nations High-level Dialogue on International Migration and Development,9 held on 3 and 4 October 2013, which reaffirmed the need to promote and protect effectively the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all migrants, regardless of their migration status, especially those of women and children, and to address international migration through international, regional or bilateral cooperation and dialogue and through a comprehensive and balanced approach, recognizing the roles and responsibilities of countries of origin, transit and destination in promoting and protecting the human rights of all migrants and avoiding approaches that might aggravate their vulnerability,
	Recalling also that the declaration recognized that women and girls account for almost half of all international migrants at the global level and the need to address the special situation and vulnerability of migrant women and girls by, 
inter alia, incorporating a gender perspective into policies and strengthening national laws, institutions and programmes to combat gender-based violence, including trafficking in persons and discrimination against them, and emphasized in this regard the need to establish appropriate measures for the protection of women migrant workers in all sectors, including those involved in domestic work,
	Welcoming the adoption of Convention No. 189 and Recommendation No. 201 on decent work for domestic workers by the International Labour Conference on 16 June 2011, at its 100th session, and the entry of the Convention into force on 5 September 2013, and inviting States to consider ratifying it, encouraging States parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women10 to take note of and consider general recommendation No. 26 on women migrant workers adopted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in November 2008,11 and encouraging States parties to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families12 to take note of and consider general comment No. 1 on migrant domestic workers adopted by the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families in December 2010,13 acknowledging that they are complementary and mutually reinforcing,
	Recognizing the increasing participation of women in international migration, driven in large part by socioeconomic factors, and that this feminization of migration requires greater gender sensitivity in all policies and efforts related to the subject of international migration,
	Stressing the shared responsibility of and need for cooperation among all stakeholders, in particular countries of origin, transit and destination, relevant regional and international organizations, the private sector and civil society, in promoting an environment that prevents and addresses violence against women migrant workers, including in the context of discrimination, through targeted measures, and in this regard recognizing the importance of joint and collaborative approaches and strategies at the national, bilateral, regional and international levels,
	Recognizing that women migrant workers are important contributors to social and economic development through the economic and social impacts, as a result of their work, on countries of origin and destination, and underlining the value and dignity of their labour, including the labour of domestic workers,
	Recognizing also the particular vulnerability and needs of women and their children at all stages of the migration process, extending from the moment of deciding to migrate, and including transit, engagement in formal and informal employment and integration into the host society, as well as during their return to and reintegration in their countries of origin,
	Expressing deep concern at the continuing reports of grave abuses and violence committed against migrant women and girls, including gender-based violence, sexual violence, domestic and family violence, racist and xenophobic acts, discrimination, abusive labour practices, exploitative conditions of work and contemporary forms of slavery, inter alia, all forms of forced labour and trafficking in persons,
	Recognizing that the intersection of, inter alia, gender, age, class, race and ethnic discrimination and stereotypes can compound the discrimination faced by women migrant workers and that gender-based violence is a form of discrimination,
	Reaffirming the commitment to protect and promote the human rights of all women, including, without discrimination, indigenous women who migrate for work, and in this regard noting the attention paid in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples14 to the elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination against indigenous women, as appropriate,
	Noting that the priority theme of the fifty-eighth session of the Commission on the Status of Women will be "Challenges and achievements in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals for women and girls" and that migration can enable equitable, inclusive and sustainable growth and human development for countries of origin and destination, migrants and their families, and in this regard recognizing the potential role and contribution of women migrant workers towards accelerating progress in the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and attaining equitable, inclusive and sustainable growth and human development,
	Concerned that many migrant women who are employed in the informal economy and in less skilled work are especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, underlining in this regard the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants so as to prevent and address abuse and exploitation, and observing with concern that many women migrant workers take on jobs for which they may be overqualified and in which, at the same time, they may be more vulnerable because of poor pay and inadequate social protection,
	Emphasizing the need for objective, comprehensive and broad-based information, including sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics, and gender-sensitive indicators for research and analysis, and a wide exchange of experience and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of targeted policies and concrete strategies to specifically address violence against women migrant workers, including in the context of discrimination,
	Realizing that the movement of a significant number of women migrant workers may be facilitated and made possible by means of fraudulent or irregular documentation and sham marriages with the object of migration, that this may be facilitated through, inter alia, the Internet and that those women migrant workers are more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation,
	Recognizing the importance of exploring the link between migration and trafficking in persons in order to further efforts towards protecting women migrant workers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse,
	Encouraged by some measures adopted by some countries of destination to alleviate the plight of women migrant workers residing in their areas of jurisdiction and to promote access to justice, such as the establishment of gender-sensitive protection mechanisms for migrant workers, facilitating their access to mechanisms for reporting complaints or providing assistance during legal proceedings,
	Underlining the important role of relevant United Nations treaty bodies in monitoring the implementation of human rights conventions and of the relevant special procedures, within their respective mandates, in addressing the problem of violence against women migrant workers and in protecting and promoting their human rights and welfare,

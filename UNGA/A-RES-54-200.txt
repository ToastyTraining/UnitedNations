54/200.	Unilateral economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against developing countries

    The General Assembly,

    Recalling the relevant principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations,

    Reaffirming the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,1 which states, inter alia, that no State may use or encourage the use of unilateral economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another State in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights,

    Bearing in mind the general principles governing the international trading system and trade policies for development contained in relevant resolutions, rules and provisions of the United Nations and the World Trade Organization,

    Recalling its resolutions 44/215 of 22 December 1989, 46/210 of 20 December 1991, 48/168 of 21 December 1993, 50/96 of 20 December 1995 and 52/181 of 18 December 1997,

    1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;2

    2.	Urges the international community to adopt urgent and effective measures to eliminate the use of unilateral coercive economic measures against developing countries that are not authorized by relevant organs of the United Nations or are inconsistent with the principles of international law as set forth in the Charter of the United Nations and that contravene the basic principles of the multilateral trading system;

    3.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to monitor the imposition of measures of this nature and to study the impact of such measures on the affected countries, including the impact on trade and development;

    4.	Also requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session on the implementation of the present resolution.

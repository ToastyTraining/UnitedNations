53/10.Elimination of coercive economic measures as a means of political and economic compulsion

	The General Assembly,

	Guided by the principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations, particularly those that call for the development of friendly relations among nations and the achievement of cooperation in solving problems of an economic and social character,

	Recalling its numerous resolutions in which it has called upon the international community to take urgent and effective steps to end coercive economic measures,

	Recalling also the final document of the Twelfth Conference of Heads of State or Government of  Non-Aligned Countries, which reaffirmed that coercive economic measures and the enactment of extraterritorial laws are incompatible with international law and the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling further the decision adopted by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its thirty-fourth ordinary session,1 in which that Assembly expressed concern at the continued imposition of extraterritorial coercive economic measures and demanded the elimination of such measures,


	Taking into account the final document of the eighth session of the Islamic Summit Conference, held in Tehran,2 which noted with grave concern that the extraterritorial application of domestic laws was having a negative impact on foreign investment in other States and rejected all coercive measures aimed at member States seeking to broaden the scope of their economic cooperation and trade,

	Deeply concerned that Member States are continuing to apply extraterritorial coercive economic laws in violation of the norms of international law and the purposes and principles of the United Nations,

	Believing that the prompt elimination of such measures would be consistent with the purposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant rules of the World Trade Organization,

	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of resolution 51/22;3

	3.	Expresses its deep concern at the negative impact of unilaterally imposed extraterritorial coercive economic measures on trade and financial and economic cooperation, including at the regional level, as well as the serious obstacles posed to the freedom of trade and the free flow of capital at the regional and international levels;

	4.	Reiterates its call for the repeal of unilateral extraterritorial laws that impose sanctions on corporations and nationals of other States;

	5.	Again calls upon all States not to recognize or apply extraterritorial coercive economic measures or legislative enactments unilaterally imposed by any State;

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution;

	7.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-fifth session the item entitled "Elimination of coercive economic measures as a means of political and economic compulsion".

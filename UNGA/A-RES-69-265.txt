	Noting in this connection the seventh general meeting between representatives of the Caribbean Community and the United Nations system, held in New York on 22 and 23 July 2013 to review the progress made in implementing the new coordination mechanism led by the United Nations Development Group for Latin America and the Caribbean and to discuss issues identified as priorities by the Caribbean Community secretariat, including climate change, small island developing States, the post-2015 development agenda, citizen security, transnational organized crime and the illegal trade in small arms and light weapons, as well as agricultural development and non-communicable diseases,
	Remaining deeply concerned about the persistent challenges posed by an international environment characterized by, inter alia, the ongoing adverse impacts of the world financial and economic crisis that have been exacerbated by onerous debt, graduation from access to concessionary development funding, the lack of access to energy and sustainable modern energy services, food insecurity, and the adverse effects of climate change, all of which have increased the vulnerabilities and seriously worsened the challenges for the development efforts of the States members of the Caribbean Community,
	Noting that the Caribbean Community has prepared a strategic plan for the period 2015-2019 with 11 high-priority areas for focused implementation, which address, inter alia, regional integration, macroeconomic stabilization, building competitiveness for growth and employment generation, human capital development, advancing health and wellness, citizen security and justice, climate adaptation and greenhouse gas mitigation, disaster mitigation and management, information and communications technology, and public education, public information and advocacy,
	Recalling the unique and particular vulnerabilities of small island developing States and the global commitment to take urgent and concrete action to address those vulnerabilities, including through the sustained and effective implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States2 and the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States,3

	Noting that the Caribbean region is the second most hazard-prone region in the world, with frequent exposure to devastating natural hazards and extreme weather events, as well as slow-onset climate change events, and concerned that their increased frequency, intensity and destructive power continue to pose a challenge to the development of the region,
	Recalling the ongoing recovery of Haiti from the devastating earthquake of 12 January 2010 and subsequent tropical storms and hurricanes that have caused significant loss of life and widespread damage, and stressing the urgent need for renewed and sustained attention to the critical situation in Haiti and to fulfil the pledges made to assist Haiti in its long-term recovery and sustainable development initiatives,
	Noting with appreciation the recent collaboration, consultations and information exchanges that have taken place among the United Nations, the Caribbean Community and the States members of the Community aimed at strengthening cooperation and regional capacity in a broad range of areas, such as sustainable development, non-communicable diseases, drugs and crime, statistics, free and fair elections, plant and animal health, and food safety, among others,
	Affirming the need to further expand and deepen the cooperation that already exists between the Caribbean Community and the United Nations agencies, funds and programmes, including in the areas of governance, information and communications technology for development, public information and institutional reforms, so as to enhance coherence and effectiveness in the partnership among the United Nations, the Caribbean Community and the States members of the Community,
	Convinced of the need for the coordinated utilization of available resources to promote the common objectives of the two organizations,

	5.	Calls upon the United Nations and the specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system, bearing in mind the particular vulnerabilities of the States members of the Caribbean Community, to intensify their assistance to those States to enable them to address the diverse challenges that these vulnerabilities pose to achieving sustainable development, including through the sustained and effective implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States,2 the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States3 and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway,4 and through the implementation of the strategic objectives of the Community;

	9.	Notes with concern the acknowledgement in the outcome document that progress has been insufficient and highly uneven in the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, due in part to the complexity and challenging nature of non-communicable diseases, and further emphasizes that continued and increased efforts are essential for achieving a world free of the avoidable burden of non-communicable diseases, including through the implementation of multisectoral cost-effective, population-wide interventions and the provision of adequate, predictable and sustained resources, through domestic, bilateral and multilateral channels, including traditional and voluntary innovative financing mechanisms;
	10.	Affirms its decision in the outcome document to give due consideration to addressing non-communicable diseases in the elaboration of the post-2015 development agenda, given their serious socioeconomic consequences and determinants and their links to poverty, and in this regard notes the target for 2030 to reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment, as reflected in the report of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals;8
	11.	Expresses appreciation for the robust partnership arrangements among the Caribbean Community, the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization in addressing non-communicable diseases, and commends the valuable supportive role being played by the World Health Organization and the Pan American Health Organization through the provision of technical and other resources to the Community in the establishment and operationalization of the Caribbean Public Health Agency as a mechanism for cooperation and coordination across the region on public health policy;

Notes with appreciation the existing cooperation between the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Caribbean Community, and calls for further deepening of that cooperation in such areas as the contribution of information and communications technology to education, the protection of world heritage sites in the Community, the challenge of male academic underachievement and the role of cultural industries in the economies of the States of the region; 
	14.	Notes with satisfaction the progress made in the initiative to erect a permanent memorial to the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade, led jointly by States members of the Caribbean Community and the Group of African States at the United Nations, and in this regard expresses sincere gratitude to those Member States, organizations and individuals that have made contributions to the United Nations Trust Fund for Partnerships - Permanent Memorial, and encourages Member States and other interested parties to make further voluntary contributions to the Trust Fund;

Notes with appreciation the ongoing efforts of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Latin America and the Caribbean in providing technical assistance and capacity-building to States members of the Caribbean Community, including in the management of stockpiles of small arms and light weapons and their ammunition and the destruction of obsolete and seized firearms, ammunition and explosives;

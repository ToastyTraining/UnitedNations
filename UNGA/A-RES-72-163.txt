	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming its previous resolutions on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,
	Reaffirming also that no one shall be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,
	Recalling that freedom from torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is a non-derogable right under international law, including international human rights law and international humanitarian law, which must be respected and protected under all circumstances, including in times of international or internal armed conflict or disturbance or any other public emergency, that the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment is affirmed in relevant international instruments and that legal and procedural safeguards against such acts must not be subject to measures that would circumvent this right,
	Recalling also that the prohibition of torture is a peremptory norm of international law without territorial limitation and that international, regional and domestic courts have recognized the prohibition of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment as customary international law,
	Recalling further the definition of torture contained in article 1 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment1 and the obligation of States to abide strictly by the definition of torture contained in article 1, without prejudice to any international instrument or national legislation which contains or may contain provisions of wider application, and emphasizing the importance of properly interpreting and implementing the obligations of States with respect to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment,
	Recognizing that States must protect the rights of those facing criminal sentences, including the death penalty and life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, and of other affected persons in accordance with their international obligations,
	Noting that, under the Geneva Conventions of 1949,2 torture and inhuman treatment are a grave breach and that, under the statute of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, the statute of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994 and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,3 acts of torture can constitute crimes against humanity and, when committed in a situation of armed conflict, constitute war crimes,
	Recognizing the importance of the implementation of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance,4 which makes a significant contribution to the prevention and prohibition of torture, including by prohibiting secret places of detention and by ensuring legal and procedural safeguards for persons deprived of their liberty, and encouraging all States that have not done so to consider signing, ratifying or acceding to the Convention,
	Taking note of the launching of the Alliance for Torture-Free Trade,
	Commending the persistent efforts of civil society organizations, including non-governmental organizations, national human rights institutions and national preventive mechanisms, and the considerable network of centres for the rehabilitation of victims of torture, to prevent and combat torture and to alleviate the suffering of victims of torture,
	Deeply concerned about all acts which can amount to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment committed against persons exercising their rights of peaceful assembly and freedom of expression in all regions of the world,
	1.	Condemns all forms of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, including through intimidation, which are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever and can thus never be justified, and calls upon all States to implement fully the absolute and non-derogable prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;
	2.	Also condemns any action or attempt by States or public officials to legalize, authorize or acquiesce in torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment under any circumstances, including on grounds of national security and counter-terrorism or through judicial decisions, and urges States to ensure the accountability of those responsible for all such acts;
	3.	Stresses that States must neither punish personnel for not obeying orders to commit or conceal acts amounting to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment nor allow pleas of respondeat superior as a criminal defence in cases in which such orders were obeyed;
	4.	Emphasizes that acts of torture or inhuman treatment are grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions of 1949,2 that acts of torture and cruel treatment in armed conflict are serious violations of international humanitarian law and in this regard constitute war crimes, that acts of torture can constitute crimes against humanity and that the perpetrators of all acts of torture must be prosecuted and punished, and in this regard notes the efforts of the International Criminal Court to end impunity by seeking to ensure accountability and punishment of perpetrators of such acts, in accordance with the Rome Statute,3 bearing in mind its principle of complementarity, and encourages States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding to the Rome Statute;
	5.	Also emphasizes that States must take persistent, determined and effective measures to prevent and combat all acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, stresses that all acts of torture must be made offences under national criminal law punishable by appropriate penalties that take into account their grave nature, and calls upon States to prohibit under national law acts constituting cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;
	6.	Stresses that States must ensure that no statement that is established to have been made as a result of torture is invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made, urges States to extend that prohibition to statements made as a result of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and recognizes that adequate corroboration of statements, including confessions, used as evidence in any proceedings constitutes one safeguard for the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;
	7.	Urges States not to expel, return ("refouler"), extradite or in any other way transfer a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture, stresses the importance of effective legal and procedural safeguards in this regard, and recognizes that diplomatic assurances, where given, do not release States from their obligations under international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law, in particular the principle of non-refoulement;
	8.	Recalls that, for the purpose of determining whether there are such grounds, the competent authorities shall take into account all relevant considerations, including, where applicable, the existence in the State concerned of a consistent pattern of gross, flagrant or mass violations of human rights;

	10.	Calls upon all States to adopt and implement effective measures to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in particular in the context of the use of force by law enforcement officials and in places of detention and other places where persons are deprived of their liberty, including legal and procedural safeguards, as well as to ensure that the competent judicial or disciplinary authorities and, where relevant, the prosecution can effectively ensure compliance with such safeguards;
	11.	Recalls its resolution 43/173 of 9 December 1988 on the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, and in this context stresses that ensuring that any individual arrested or detained is promptly brought before a judge or other independent judicial officer in person, and permitting prompt and regular medical care and legal counsel throughout all stages of detention, as well as visits by family members and independent monitoring mechanisms, are effective measures for the prevention of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;
	12.	Stresses the obligation of States to ensure that anyone who is arrested is informed at the time of arrest of the reasons for the arrest and is promptly informed of any charges against him or her, in accessible forms of communication, including in a language that he or she understands, and is provided with information about, and an explanation of, his or her rights;
	13.	Calls upon States to include education and information regarding the absolute prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the training of law enforcement personnel and other personnel authorized to resort to force or who may be involved in the custody, interrogation or treatment of any individual subjected to any form of arrest, detention or imprisonment, which may include training on the use of force, all available modern scientific methods for the investigation of crimes and the critical importance of reporting instances of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment to superior authorities;
	14.	Emphasizes that States shall keep under systematic review interrogation rules, instructions, methods and practices, as well as arrangements for the custody and treatment of persons subjected to any form of arrest, detention or imprisonment in any territory under their jurisdiction, and stresses the importance of the development of domestic guidelines on the conduct of interrogations, with a view to preventing any cases of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;

Reminds all States that prolonged incommunicado detention or detention in secret places can facilitate the perpetration of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and can in itself constitute a form of such treatment, and urges all States to respect the safeguards concerning the liberty, security and dignity of the person and to ensure that prolonged incommunicado detention and secret places of detention and interrogation are abolished; 
	17.	Emphasizes that conditions of detention must respect the dignity and human rights of persons deprived of their liberty, highlights the importance of reflecting on this in efforts to promote respect for and protection of the rights of persons deprived of their liberty, calls upon States to address and prevent detention conditions amounting to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, notes in this regard concerns about solitary confinement, and encourages States to take effective measures to address overcrowding in detention facilities, which may have an impact on the dignity and human rights of persons deprived of their liberty;
	18.	Welcomes the establishment of national preventive mechanisms to prevent torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, urges States to consider establishing, appointing, maintaining or enhancing independent and effective mechanisms that have experts with the required capabilities and professional knowledge to undertake monitoring visits to places of detention, inter alia, with a view to preventing acts of torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, and calls upon States parties to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment6 to fulfil their obligation to designate or establish national preventive mechanisms that are truly independent, properly resourced and effective;

	21.	Also urges States to ensure accountability for any act of sanction, reprisal, intimidation or other form of unlawful prejudicial conduct against any person, group or association, including persons deprived of their liberty, for cooperating, seeking to cooperate or having cooperated with any national or international monitoring or preventive body active in the prevention and combating of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, by ensuring impartial, prompt, independent and thorough investigations of any alleged act of sanction, reprisal, intimidation or other form of unlawful prejudicial conduct; to bring the perpetrators to justice; to provide access to effective remedies for victims, in accordance with their international human rights obligations and commitments; and to prevent any recurrence;
	22.

	25.	Recalls, in this respect, the Principles on the Effective Investigation and Documentation of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (the Istanbul Principles)7 as a valuable tool in efforts to prevent and combat torture and the updated set of principles for the protection and promotion of human rights through action to combat impunity;8

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Mission in Haiti 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Recalling Security Council resolution 862 (1993) of 31 August 1993, in which the Council approved the dispatch of an advance team of no more than  thirty persons to assess requirements and prepare for the possible dispatch of both the civilian police and the military assistance components of the proposed United Nations Mission in Haiti, and decided that the mandate of the advance team would expire within one month,

	Recalling also Security Council resolution 867 (1993) of 23 September 1993, in which the Council authorized the establishment and immediate dispatch of the Mission for a period of six months subject to the proviso that it would be extended beyond seventy-five days only upon a review by the Council to be based on a report from the Secretary-General indicating whether or not substantive progress had been made towards the implementation of the Governors Island Agreement of 3 July 1993 between the President of the Republic of Haiti and the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Haiti 3/ and the political accords contained in the New York Pact, 4/


	Recalling further Security Council resolution 940 (1994) of 31 July 1994, in which the Council, acting under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations, authorized Member States to form a multinational force under unified command and control and, in that framework, to use all necessary means to facilitate the departure from Haiti of the military leadership, consistent with the Governors Island Agreement, the prompt return of the legitimately elected President and the restoration of the legitimate authorities of the Government of Haiti, and to establish and maintain a secure and stable environment that would permit implementation of the Governors Island Agreement, and approved the establishment of an advance team of no more than sixty persons, including a group of observers, to establish the appropriate means of coordination with the Multinational Force, to carry out the monitoring of the operations of the Force and to assess requirements and to prepare for the deployment of the United Nations Mission in Haiti upon completion of the mission of the Multinational Force,

	Recalling Security Council resolution 964 (1994) of 29 November 1994, in which the Council authorized the Secretary-General to strengthen progressively the advance team of the Mission up to five hundred persons in order to further facilitate the planning of the Mission, identification of conditions required for the transition from the Multinational Force and preparation for the actual transition, as well as to make good offices available for the achievement of the purposes approved by the Council in resolution 940 (1994),

	Recalling also Security Council resolution 975 (1995) of 30 January 1995, in which the Council authorized the Secretary-General to deploy up to six thousand troops and nine hundred civilian police officers, and extended the mandate of the Mission for a period of six months, to 31 July 1995,

	Recalling further its decision 48/477 of 23 December 1993, its resolution 48/246 of 5 April 1994 and its decision 49/468 of 23 December 1994 on the financing of the Mission,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

		Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peace-keeping activities, particularly as regards the reimbursement of troop-contributors, because of overdue payments by Member States of their assessments, particularly Member States in arrears;

		Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the United Nations Mission in Haiti promptly and in full, which will contribute to the operational effectiveness of the Mission;

		Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/ subject to the provisions of the present resolution;

	(b)	To adhere strictly to the procurement rules and regulations;

	(c)	To seek prior concurrence of the Advisory Committee before entering into commitments under the provisions of section IV of General Assembly resolution 49/233 A of 23 December 1994;

		Reaffirms its resolution 49/233 A, in particular its section II thereof regarding contingent-owned equipment, and takes note of the fact that the procedures used for budgeting for the reimbursement of contingent-owned equipment in the Mission do not prejudge the decision to be taken by the General Assembly on this matter in accordance with its resolution 49/233 A;

		Stresses the importance of the coordination between the United Nations Mission in Haiti, the International Civilian Mission in Haiti and all organizations and bodies involved in the implementation of the aid programme in Haiti, with a view to rationalizing the use of funds provided from voluntary and assessed contributions and avoiding duplication of activities and waste of resources;

	4.	Decides that any decisions with regard to the pension scheme shall apply only to the members of the International Court of Justice and the judges and ad litem judges of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and shall not constitute a precedent for any other category of judges working within the United Nations system and that any decision regarding the service of any other category of judges shall be taken on a case-by-case basis; 
	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to make the necessary revisions to article 1, paragraph 2, of the Pension Scheme Regulations for the members of the International Court of Justice and for the judges of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, accordingly;

	7.	Recalls paragraph 11 of its resolution 61/262, in which it requested the Secretary-General to report on options for designing pension schemes, and notes that the Secretary-General has proposed essentially only one option and that, rather than seek the expertise available within the Organization, he has relied on the services of a consultant; 
	8.	Decides that the emoluments, pensions, and other conditions of service for the members of the International Court of Justice and the judges of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda shall next be reviewed at its sixty-fifth session, including options for defined benefit and defined contribution pension schemes, and in this regard, requests the Secretary-General to ensure that, in that review, the expertise available within the United Nations is taken full advantage of;

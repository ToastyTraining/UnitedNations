	Stressing that human resources development lies at the heart of economic, social and environmental development and that health and education are at the core of human resources development,
	Stressing also that human resources development is key to the efforts to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and to expand opportunities for people, in particular for the most vulnerable groups of the population,
	Welcoming the considerable efforts made over the years, yet recognizing that many countries continue to face formidable challenges in developing a sufficient pool of human resources capable of meeting national economic and social needs and that the formulation and implementation of effective human resources strategies often require resources and capacities not always available in developing countries, and also recognizing the need for new ways to address human resources development,
	Recognizing the potential of science, technological knowledge and innovation to address key challenges to human resources development, which can lead to positive transformations in people's lives,
	Stressing that human resources development is even more critical in view of the current global challenges, including, despite evidence of an uneven and fragile recovery, the ongoing adverse impacts, particularly on development, of the world financial and economic crisis, in order to tackle the negative effects of the global crisis and set the basis for sustained, inclusive and equitable growth and recovery,
	Recognizing that the benefits of human resources development are best realized in national and international environments that support equal opportunity, access to education and non-discrimination and maintain an enabling environment for job creation,
	Recognizing also that despite evidence of an uneven and fragile recovery, the ongoing adverse impacts, particularly on development, of the world financial and economic crisis continue to diminish the ability of many countries, especially developing countries, to cope with and address human resources development challenges and to formulate and implement effective strategies for poverty eradication and sustainable development,
	Acknowledging the important nexus between international migration and development and the need to deal with the challenges and opportunities that migration presents to countries of origin, transit and destination, recognizing that migration brings benefits as well as challenges to the global community, and stressing that the brain drain continues to be a severe problem in many developing and transitioning countries, undermining efforts in the area of human resources development,
	Recognizing that science, technological knowledge and innovation can overcome important physical, infrastructural and cultural barriers that prevent people, especially in poor and marginalized communities, from living a healthy and productive life, 
	Recognizing also the need to align science, technological knowledge and innovation systems with national development objectives, fully integrated with national human resources development and poverty eradication strategies and supported by appropriate institutional and policy frameworks, 
	Acknowledging that science, technological knowledge and innovation policies should take into account the specific features of the economy in developing countries, including the size of the traditional sector, the importance of indigenous knowledge, the limited access to skilled labour and capital, weak infrastructure and inadequate institutional frameworks, in order to generate solutions that address the specific challenges of those countries and to foster synergies between modern science and technology and indigenous and local knowledge, 
	Reaffirming that gender equality is of fundamental importance for achieving sustained economic growth, poverty eradication and sustainable development, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and United Nations conferences, and that investing in the development of women and girls has a multiplier effect, in particular on productivity, efficiency and sustained economic growth, in all sectors of the economy, especially in key areas such as agriculture, industry and services,
	Recognizing that education is the key to promoting the development of human potential, equality and understanding among peoples, as well as to sustaining economic growth and eradicating poverty, and recognizing also that, to achieve those ends, it is essential that quality education be available to all, including indigenous peoples, girls and women, rural inhabitants and persons with disabilities,

	13.	Stresses that human resources development strategies should include measures aimed at reducing unemployment and underemployment among young men and women and the long-term unemployed, who have been disproportionately affected by slow growth in jobs recovery, and to integrate underutilized human resources into the labour market through policies that promote skills development and productivity and reduce barriers to employment, including gender barriers, including by providing incentives as appropriate for recruiting, retaining and retooling, assistance in job-finding and job-matching and vocational and on-the-job training, and by promoting, inter alia, youth entrepreneurship, noting in this regard the call for action by the International Labour Conference;

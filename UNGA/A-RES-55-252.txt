	The General Assembly,
	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea1 and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

	14.	Decides also, as an ad hoc arrangement, taking into account the amount of 150 million dollars gross (148,220,200 dollars net) already apportioned under the terms of its resolution 55/237, to apportion the additional amount of 30 million dollars gross (29,646,700 dollars net) for the period from 31 July 2000 to 30 June 2001 among Member States in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of its resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by subsequent relevant resolutions and decisions, for the apportionment of peacekeeping appropriations, the latest of which were its resolution 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and its decisions 54/456 to 54/458 of 23 December 1999 for the period 1998-2000, and its resolutions 55/235 and 55/236 of 23 December 2000 for the period 2001-2003, the scale of assessments for 20004 to be applied against a portion thereof, that is, 13,791,045 dollars gross (13,628,632 dollars net), which is the amount pertaining to the period ending 31 December 2000, and the scale of assessments for 20015 to be applied against the balance, that is, 16,208,955 dollars gross (16,018,068 dollars net) for the period from 1 January to 30 June 2001;

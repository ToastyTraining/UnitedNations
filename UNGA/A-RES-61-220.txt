	Reaffirming also its resolutions 46/182 of 19 December 1991, 47/168 of 22 December 1992, 48/57 of 14 December 1993, 49/139 A and B of 20 December 1994, 50/57 of 12 December 1995 and 51/194 of 17 December 1996 and Economic and Social Council resolutions 1995/56 of 28 July 1995 and 1996/33 of 25 July 1996, 
	Emphasizing the need for coordination between relief and development activities in the context of humanitarian emergencies, taking into account the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 
	Recognizing that the international community, in addressing the growing magnitude and complexity of man-made and natural disasters and chronic situations characterized by hunger, malnutrition and poverty, must rely not only on the formulation of a well-coordinated global response within the framework of the United Nations but also on the promotion of a smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation, reconstruction and development, 
	Recalling once again that prevention, preparedness and contingency planning for emergencies on a global level depend, for the most part, on the strengthening of local and national response capacities, on the availability of financial resources, both domestic and international, and on the effective use of those resources, 
	Recognizing the need to integrate a gender perspective in the design and implementation of all phases of disaster management, 
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General,2 prepared in pursuance of its resolution 58/118 on the participation of volunteers, "White Helmets", in the activities of the United Nations in the field of humanitarian relief, rehabilitation and technical cooperation for development, especially in the three main areas on which action has been focused, namely dissemination of the concept of volunteerism, support to Latin American and Caribbean countries and response to requests for emergency assistance; 
	2.	Recognizes the effort being made by the White Helmets initiative to strengthen national and regional agreements aimed at facilitating coordination between the United Nations system and trained standby national volunteer corps, in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures, through the United Nations Volunteers and other agencies of the system; 
	3.	Notes the emphasis placed on the development of mechanisms to facilitate the local management of humanitarian emergencies, through the organization and participatory involvement and empowerment of affected communities and the training of the members of local volunteer corps; 
	4.	Recognizes the effort of the White Helmets model in helping to involve stricken populations or those at risk in the tasks of planning, training, mobilizing and providing immediate response in disaster situations; 
	5.	Notes the importance of international efforts being made by the White Helmets initiative to strengthen the comprehensive regional mechanisms for managing prevention and response activities in emergency and disaster situations, in particular its model for setting up regional networks of focal points, with a view to linkage with other international structures; 
	6.	Encourages Member States to identify their respective national focal points for the White Helmets in order to continue to provide the United Nations system with an accessible global network of rapid response facilities in the event of humanitarian emergencies; 
	7.	Takes note of the efforts made by the World Food Programme and the White Helmets to coordinate integration mechanisms that allow for joint action in the framework of food security, on the basis of their general agreements of 1998; 
	8.	Encourages operational partners of the United Nations system, in particular the United Nations Volunteers and the World Health Organization, in providing psychosocial support to the disaster-affected population in emergency and disaster situations, to draw, as appropriate, upon the voluntary expertise of the White Helmets, which has been successfully tested, as indicated by the Secretary-General in his report; 
	9.	Recognizes that the White Helmets initiative can play an important role in the promotion, diffusion and implementation of the decisions adopted in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 and invites Member States in a position to do so to consider means to ensure the integration of the White Helmets initiative into their programme activities and to make financial resources available to the Special Voluntary Fund of the United Nations Volunteers; 
	10.	Invites the Secretary-General, on the basis of the extensive international work experience acquired by the White Helmets, as recognized by the General Assembly since the adoption of its resolution 49/139 B, the first resolution on the White Helmets initiative, and in view of the success of coordinated actions carried out with, inter alia, the United Nations Children's Fund, the World Food Programme, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat, the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Volunteers, to suggest measures to enhance the integration of the White Helmets initiative with the work of the United Nations system, and to report thereon to the Assembly at its sixty-fourth session in a separate section of the annual report on strengthening of the coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance of the United Nations.

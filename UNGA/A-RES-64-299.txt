Annex
Keeping the promise: united to achieve the Millennium Development Goals

1.	We, Heads of State and Government, gathered at United Nations Headquarters in New York from 20 to 22 September 2010, welcome the progress made since we last met here in 2005, while expressing deep concern that it falls far short of what is needed. We reaffirm our resolve to work together for the promotion of the economic and social advancement of all peoples, recalling the development goals and commitments emanating from the United Nations Millennium Declaration1 and the 2005 World Summit Outcome.2
2.	We reaffirm that we continue to be guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and with full respect for international law and its principles. 
3.	We also reaffirm the importance of freedom, peace and security, respect for all human rights, including the right to development, the rule of law, gender equality and an overall commitment to just and democratic societies for development. 
4.	We underscore the continued relevance of the outcomes of all major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields and the commitments contained therein, including the Millennium Development Goals, which have raised awareness and continue to generate real and important development gains. Together these outcomes and commitments have played a vital role in shaping a broad development vision and constitute the overarching framework for the development activities of the United Nations. We strongly reiterate our determination to ensure the timely and full implementation of these outcomes and commitments. 
5.	We recognize that progress, including in poverty eradication, is being made despite setbacks, including setbacks caused by the financial and economic crisis. In this context, we recognize the deeply inspiring examples of progress made by countries in all regions of the world through cooperation, partnerships, actions and solidarity. We are deeply concerned, however, that the number of people living in extreme poverty and hunger surpasses one billion and that inequalities between and within countries remain a significant challenge. We are also deeply concerned about the alarming global levels of maternal and child mortality. We believe that eradication of poverty and hunger, as well as combating inequality at all levels, is essential to create a more prosperous and sustainable future for all. 
6.	We reiterate our deep concern at the multiple and interrelated crises, including the financial and economic crisis, volatile energy and food prices and ongoing concerns over food security, as well as the increasing challenges posed by climate change and the loss of biodiversity, which have increased vulnerabilities and inequalities and have adversely affected development gains, in particular in developing countries. But this will not deter us in our efforts to make the Millennium Development Goals a reality for all. 
7.	We are determined to collectively advance and strengthen the global partnership for development, as the centrepiece of our cooperation, in the years ahead. The global partnership has been reaffirmed in the Millennium Declaration,1 the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development,3 the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development ("Johannesburg Plan of Implementation"),4 the 2005 World Summit Outcome2 and the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development: outcome document of the Follow-up International Conference on Financing for Development to Review the Implementation of the Monterrey Consensus.5 
8.	We are committed to making every effort to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, including through actions, policies and strategies defined in the present outcome document in support of developing countries, in particular those countries that are lagging most behind and those Goals that are most off track, thus improving the lives of the poorest people. 
9.	We are convinced that the Millennium Development Goals can be achieved, including in the poorest countries, with renewed commitment, effective implementation and intensified collective action by all Member States and other relevant stakeholders at both the domestic and international levels, using national development strategies and appropriate policies and approaches that have proved to be effective, with strengthened institutions at all levels, increased mobilization of resources for development, increased effectiveness of development cooperation and an enhanced global partnership for development. 
10.	We reaffirm that national ownership and leadership are indispensable in the development process. There is no one size fits all. We reiterate that each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development and that the role of national policies, domestic resources and development strategies cannot be overemphasized. At the same time, domestic economies are now interwoven with the global economic system and, therefore, an effective use of trade and investment opportunities can help countries to fight poverty. Development efforts at the national level need to be supported by an enabling national and international environment that complements national actions and strategies. 
11.	We acknowledge that good governance and the rule of law at the national and international levels are essential for sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth, sustainable development and the eradication of poverty and hunger. 
12.	We recognize that gender equality, the empowerment of women, women's full enjoyment of all human rights and the eradication of poverty are essential to economic and social development, including the achievement of all the Millennium Development Goals. We reaffirm the need for the full and effective implementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action.6 Achieving gender equality and empowerment of women is both a key development goal and an important means for achieving all of the Millennium Development Goals. We welcome the establishment of the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women), and pledge our full support for its operationalization. 
13.	We acknowledge that peace and security, development and human rights are the pillars of the United Nations system and the foundations for collective security and well-being. We recognize that development, peace and security and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing. We reaffirm that our common fundamental values, including freedom, equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for all human rights, respect for nature and shared responsibility, are essential for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. 
14.	We are convinced that the United Nations, on the basis of its universal membership, legitimacy and unique mandate, plays a vital role in the promotion of international cooperation for development and in supporting the acceleration of the implementation of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. We reaffirm the need for a strong United Nations to meet the challenges of the changing global environment. 
15.	We recognize that all the Millennium Development Goals are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. We therefore underline the need to pursue these Goals through a holistic and comprehensive approach. 
16.	We acknowledge the diversity of the world and recognize that all cultures and civilizations contribute to the enrichment of humankind. We emphasize the importance of culture for development and its contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. 
17.	We call on civil society, including non-governmental organizations, voluntary associations and foundations, the private sector and other relevant stakeholders at the local, national, regional and global levels, to enhance their role in national development efforts as well as their contribution to the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015, and we commit ourselves as national Governments to the inclusion of these stakeholders. 
18.	We acknowledge the role of national parliaments in furthering the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.

		A mixed story: successes, uneven progress, challenges and opportunities

19.	We recognize that developing countries have made significant efforts towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals and have had major successes in realizing some of the targets of the Millennium Development Goals. Successes have been made in combating extreme poverty, improving school enrolment and child health, reducing child deaths, expanding access to clean water, improving prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, expanding access to HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment and care, and controlling malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases. 
20.	We acknowledge that much more needs to be done in achieving the Millennium Development Goals as progress has been uneven among regions and between and within countries. Hunger and malnutrition rose again from 2007 through 2009, partially reversing prior gains. There has been slow progress in reaching full and productive employment and decent work for all, advancing gender equality and the empowerment of women, achieving environmental sustainability and providing basic sanitation, and new HIV infections still outpace the number of people starting treatment. In particular, we express grave concern over the slow progress being made in reducing maternal mortality and improving maternal and reproductive health. Progress on other Millennium Development Goals is fragile and must be sustained to avoid reversal. 
21.	We underline the central role of the global partnership for development and the importance of Goal 8 in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We recognize that without substantial international support, several of the Goals are likely to be missed in many developing countries by 2015. 
22.	We are deeply concerned about the impact of the financial and economic crisis, the worst since the Great Depression. It has reversed development gains in many developing countries and threatens to seriously undermine the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. 
23.	We take note of the lessons learned and the successful policies and approaches in the implementation and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and recognize that with increased political commitment these could be replicated and scaled up for accelerating progress, including by: 
	(a)	Strengthening national ownership and leadership of development strategies; 
	(b)	Adopting forward-looking, macroeconomic policies that promote sustainable development and lead to sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth, increase productive employment opportunities and promote agricultural and industrial development; 
	(c)	Promoting national food security strategies that strengthen support for smallholder farmers and contribute to poverty eradication; 
	(d)	Adopting policies and measures oriented towards benefiting the poor and addressing social and economic inequalities; 
	(e)	Supporting participatory, community-led strategies aligned with national development priorities and strategies; 
	(f)	Promoting universal access to public and social services and providing social protection floors; 
	(g)	Improving capacity to deliver quality services equitably; 
	(h)	Implementing social policies and programmes, including appropriate conditional cash-transfer programmes, and investing in basic services for health, education, water and sanitation; 
	(i)	Ensuring the full participation of all segments of society, including the poor and disadvantaged, in decision-making processes; 
	(j)	Respecting, promoting and protecting all human rights, including the right to development; 
	(k)	Increasing efforts to reduce inequality and eliminate social exclusion and discrimination; 
	(l)	Enhancing opportunities for women and girls and advancing the economic, legal and political empowerment of women; 
	(m)	Investing in the health of women and children to drastically reduce the number of women and children who die from preventable causes;
	(n)	Working towards transparent and accountable systems of governance at the national and international levels; 
	(o)	Working towards greater transparency and accountability in international development cooperation, in both donor and developing countries, focusing on adequate and predictable financial resources as well as their improved quality and targeting; 
	(p)	Promoting South-South and triangular cooperation, which complement North-South cooperation; 
	(q)	Promoting effective public-private partnerships; 
	(r)	Expanding access to financial services for the poor, especially poor women, including through adequately funded microfinance plans, programmes and initiatives supported by development partners; 
	(s)	Strengthening statistical capacity to produce reliable disaggregated data for better programmes and policy evaluation and formulation. 
24.	We recognize that the scaling-up of the successful policies and approaches outlined above will need to be complemented by a strengthened global partnership for development, as set out in the action agenda below. 
25.	We take note of the first formal debate organized by the President of the General Assembly in which different views on the notion of human security were presented by Member States, as well as the ongoing efforts to define the notion of human security, and recognize the need to continue the discussion and to achieve an agreement on the definition of human security in the General Assembly. 
26.	We recognize that climate change poses serious risks and challenges to all countries, especially developing countries. We commit ourselves to addressing climate change in accordance with the principles and provisions of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,7 including the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities. We maintain the Framework Convention as the primary international, intergovernmental forum for negotiating the global response to climate change. Addressing climate change will be of key importance in safeguarding and advancing progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. 
27.	We recognize that attention must be focused on the particular needs of developing countries and on the large and increasing economic and social inequalities. Disparities between developed and developing countries and inequalities between the rich and the poor, and between rural and urban populations, inter alia, remain persistent and significant and need to be addressed. 
28.	We recognize that policies and actions must focus on the poor and those living in the most vulnerable situations, including persons with disabilities, so that they may benefit from progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. In this respect, there is a particular need to provide more equitable access to economic opportunities and social services. 
29.	We recognize the urgency of paying attention to the many developing countries with specific needs, and the unique challenges they confront in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. 
30.	We acknowledge that the least developed countries face significant constraints and structural impediments in their development efforts. We express grave concern that the least developed countries are lagging behind in meeting internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. In that context, we call for continued implementation of the Brussels Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-20108 and look forward to the Fourth United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, to be held in Istanbul, Turkey, in 2011, which would further invigorate the international partnership to address the special needs of these countries. 
31.	We reiterate our recognition of the special needs of and challenges faced by the landlocked developing countries, caused by their lack of territorial access to the sea, aggravated by remoteness from world markets and also the concern that the economic growth and social well-being of landlocked developing countries remain very vulnerable to external shocks. We stress the need to overcome these vulnerabilities and build resilience. We call for the full, timely and effective implementation of the Almaty Programme of Action: Addressing the Special Needs of Landlocked Developing Countries within a New Global Framework for Transit Transport Cooperation for Landlocked and Transit Developing Countries,9 as reaffirmed in the Declaration of the high-level meeting of the sixty-third session of the General Assembly on the midterm review of the Almaty Programme of Action.10 
32.	We recognize the unique and particular vulnerabilities of small island developing States and reaffirm our commitment to take urgent and concrete action to address those vulnerabilities through the full and effective implementation of the Mauritius Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Sustainable Development of Small Island Developing States.11 We also recognize that the adverse effects of climate change and sea-level rise present significant risks to the sustainable development of small island developing States. We note the uneven progress of small island developing States in achieving the Millennium Development Goals and express concern that progress in some areas has been lagging. In this regard, we welcome the five-year high-level review of the Mauritius Strategy to be conducted on 24 and 25 September 2010 to assess progress made in addressing the vulnerabilities of small island developing States. 
33.	We recognize that more attention should be given to Africa, especially those countries most off track to achieve the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. Progress has been made in some African countries, but the situation in others remains a grave concern, not least because the continent is among the hardest hit by the financial and economic crisis. We note that aid to Africa has increased in recent years; however, it still lags behind the commitments that have been made. We therefore strongly call for the delivery of those commitments. 
34.	We recognize also the specific development challenges of middle-income countries. These countries face unique challenges in their efforts to achieve their national development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. We also reiterate that their efforts in that regard should be based on national development plans that integrate the Millennium Development Goals and should be adequately supported by the international community, through various forms, taking into account the needs and the capacity to mobilize domestic resources of these countries. 
35.	We acknowledge that disaster risk reduction and increasing resilience to all types of natural hazards, including geological and hydro-meteorological hazards, in developing countries, in line with the Hyogo Framework for Action 2005-2015: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters,12 can have multiplier effects and accelerate achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Reducing vulnerabilities to these hazards is therefore a high priority for developing countries. We recognize that small island developing States continue to grapple with natural disasters, some of increased intensity, including as a result of the effects of climate change, impeding progress towards sustainable development.

		The way forward: an action agenda for achieving the Millennium Development Goals by 2015

36.	We resolve to promote and strengthen national ownership and leadership of development as a key determinant of progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals, with each country taking the primary responsibility for its own development. We encourage all countries to continue to design, implement and monitor development strategies tailored to their specific situations, including through broad consultations and participation of all relevant stakeholders, as appropriate for each national context. We call on the United Nations system and other development actors to support the design and implementation of these strategies, at the request of Member States. 
37.	We recognize that the increasing interdependence of national economies in a globalizing world and the emergence of rules-based regimes for international economic relations have meant that the space for national economic policy, that is, the scope for domestic policies, especially in the areas of trade, investment and international development, is now often framed by international disciplines, commitments and global market considerations. It is for each Government to evaluate the trade-off between the benefits of accepting international rules and commitments and the constraints posed by the loss of policy space. 
38.	We reaffirm the Monterrey Consensus3 and the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development5 in their entirety, and their integrity and holistic approach, and recognize that mobilizing financial resources for development and the effective use of all those resources are central to the global partnership for development, including in support of the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals. 
39.	We call for the expeditious delivery of commitments already made by developed countries in the context of the Monterrey Consensus3 and the Doha Declaration on Financing for Development.5 Short-term liquidity, long-term development financing and grants, in accordance with these commitments, will be utilized to assist developing countries to adequately respond to their development priorities. In our common pursuit of growth, poverty eradication and sustainable development, a critical challenge is to ensure the necessary internal conditions for mobilizing domestic resources, both public and private, sustaining adequate levels of productive investment and increasing human capacity. Private international capital flows, particularly foreign direct investment, along with international financial stability, are vital complements to national and international development efforts. 
40.	We stress the need for further reform and modernization of the international financial institutions to better enable them to respond to and prevent financial and economic emergencies, effectively promote development and better serve the needs of Member States. We reaffirm the importance of enhancing the voice and representation of developing countries in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, and note the reforms undertaken by the World Bank and the progress made by the International Monetary Fund in that direction. 
41.	We call for increased efforts at all levels to enhance policy coherence for development. We affirm that achievement of the Millennium Development Goals requires mutually supportive and integrated policies across a wide range of economic, social and environmental issues for sustainable development. We call on all countries to formulate and implement policies consistent with the objectives of sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth, poverty eradication and sustainable development. 
42.	We reiterate the important role of trade as an engine of growth and development and its contribution to the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals. We emphasize the need to resist protectionist tendencies and to rectify any trade distorting measures already taken that are inconsistent with World Trade Organization rules, recognizing the right of countries, in particular developing countries, to fully utilize their flexibilities consistent with their World Trade Organization commitments and obligations. The early and successful conclusion of the Doha Round with a balanced, ambitious, comprehensive and development-oriented outcome would provide much needed impetus to international trade and contribute to economic growth and development. 
43.	We stress that promoting sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth is necessary for accelerating progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, as well as for promoting sustainable development, but it is not sufficient: growth should enable everyone, in particular the poor, to participate in and benefit from economic opportunities and should lead to job creation and income opportunities and be complemented by effective social policies. 
44.	We commit ourselves to redoubling our efforts to reduce maternal and child mortality and improve the health of women and children, including through strengthened national health systems, efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, improved nutrition, and access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation, making use of enhanced global partnerships. We stress that accelerating progress on the Millennium Development Goals related to health is essential for making headway also with the other Goals. 
45.	We reiterate our commitment to ensure that by 2015 children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary education. 
46.	We emphasize the importance of addressing energy issues, including access to affordable energy, energy efficiency and sustainability of energy sources and use, as part of global efforts for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and the promotion of sustainable development. 
47.	We recognize the importance of developing economic and social infrastructure and productive capacities for sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development, particularly in developing countries, bearing in mind the need to enhance employment and income opportunities for all, with a special focus on the poor. 
48.	We stress the need to create full and productive employment and decent work for all and further resolve to promote the Global Jobs Pact as a general framework within which each country can formulate policy packages specific to its situation and national priorities in order to promote a job intensive recovery and sustainable development. We call on Member States to take effective measures for promoting social inclusion and integration and incorporate these into their national development strategies. 
49.	We resolve to take further effective measures and actions, in conformity with international law, to remove obstacles and constraints, strengthen support and meet the special needs of the regions and countries struggling to achieve economic and social development, including the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries, small island developing States, middle-income countries, Africa, and people living in areas affected by complex humanitarian emergencies and in areas affected by terrorism. In addition, we acknowledge the need to take concerted actions, in conformity with international law, to remove the obstacles to the full realization of the rights of peoples living under foreign occupation to promote the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. 
50.	We recognize the specific development challenges related to peacebuilding and early recovery in countries affected by conflict and the effect of these challenges on their efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. We request donor countries to provide adequate, timely and predictable development assistance in support of these efforts, tailored to country-specific needs and situations, at the request of the recipient country. We are determined to strengthen international partnerships to address these needs, demonstrate progress and enable improved international support. 
51.	We consider that promoting universal access to social services and providing social protection floors can make an important contribution to consolidating and achieving further development gains. Social protection systems that address and reduce inequality and social exclusion are essential for protecting the gains towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. 
52.	We stress that fighting corruption at both the national and international levels is a priority and that corruption is a serious barrier to effective resource mobilization and allocation and diverts resources away from activities that are vital for poverty eradication, the fight against hunger and sustainable development. We are determined to take urgent and decisive steps to continue to combat corruption in all of its manifestations, which requires strong institutions at all levels, and urge all States that have not yet done so to consider ratifying or acceding to the United Nations Convention against Corruption13 and to begin its implementation. 
53.	We recognize that the respect for and promotion and protection of human rights is an integral part of effective work towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. 
54.	We acknowledge the importance of gender equality and empowerment of women to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. Women are agents of development. We call for action to ensure the equal access of women and girls to education, basic services, health care, economic opportunities and decision-making at all levels. We stress that investing in women and girls has a multiplier effect on productivity, efficiency and sustained economic growth. We recognize the need for gender mainstreaming in the formulation and implementation of development policies. 
55.	We reaffirm that States should, in accordance with international law, take concerted, positive steps to ensure respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms of indigenous people, on the basis of equality and non-discrimination and recognizing the value and diversity of their distinctive identities, cultures and social organization. 
56.	We resolve to work with all stakeholders and strengthen partnerships in achieving the Millennium Development Goals. The private sector plays a vital role in development in many countries, including through public-private partnerships and by generating employment and investment, developing new technologies and enabling sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth. We call upon the private sector to further contribute to poverty eradication, including by adapting its business models to the needs and possibilities of the poor. Foreign direct investment and trade, as well as public-private partnerships, are important for the scaling-up of initiatives. In this connection we note the work of the United Nations Global Compact, in which companies have committed to corporate social responsibility and action in support of the Millennium Development Goals. 
57.	We stress the importance of strengthening regional and subregional cooperation for accelerating national development strategy implementation, including through regional and subregional development banks and initiatives. We also emphasize the importance of strengthening regional and subregional institutions to provide effective support to regional and national development strategies. 
58.	We reaffirm that the United Nations funds, programmes and regional commissions, and the specialized agencies, in accordance with their respective mandates, have an important role to play in advancing development and in protecting development gains, in accordance with national strategies and priorities, including progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals. We will continue to take steps for a strong, well-coordinated, coherent and effective United Nations system in support of the Millennium Development Goals. We emphasize the principle of national ownership and leadership, support the initiative of some countries to use, on a voluntary basis, common country programme documents, and emphasize our support for all countries that wish to continue using the existing frameworks and processes for country-level programming.
59.	We stress the need for adequate quantity and quality of funding for the operational activities of the United Nations development system as well as the need to make funding more predictable, effective and efficient. We also reaffirm, in this context, the importance of accountability, transparency and improved results-based management and further harmonized results-based reporting on the work of the United Nations funds and programmes and the specialized agencies. 
60.	We resolve to enhance efforts to mobilize adequate and predictable financial and high-quality technical support, as well as to promote the development and dissemination of appropriate, affordable and sustainable technology and the transfer of such technologies on mutually agreed terms, which is crucial for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. 
61.	We consider that innovative financing mechanisms can make a positive contribution in assisting developing countries to mobilize additional resources for financing for development on a voluntary basis. Such financing should supplement and not be a substitute for traditional sources of financing. While recognizing the considerable progress in innovative sources of financing for development, we call for scaling-up of present initiatives, where appropriate. 
62.	We welcome the ongoing efforts to strengthen and support South-South cooperation and triangular cooperation. We stress that South-South cooperation is not a substitute for, but rather a complement to, North-South cooperation. We call for the effective implementation of the outcome document of the High-level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation, held in Nairobi from 1 to 3 December 2009.14
63.	We recognize the regional efforts being made to advance the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals by 2015. In this regard, we welcome the convening of the fifteenth ordinary session of the Summit of the African Union in Kampala from 19 to 27 July 2010, with the theme "Maternal, infant and child health and development in Africa", the launch of the African Union Campaign on Accelerated Reduction of Maternal Mortality in Africa; the slogan "Africa cares: no woman should die while giving life"; the Special Ministerial Meeting to Review the Millennium Development Goals in Asia and the Pacific: run-up to 2015, held in Jakarta on 3 and 4 August 2010; the report of the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean on progress in Latin America and the Caribbean towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals; and similar reports produced by other regional commissions, all of which will contribute positively to the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly, as well as to the achievement of Millennium Development Goals by 2015.
64.	We welcome the increasing efforts to improve the quality of official development assistance and to increase its development impact, and recognize that the Development Cooperation Forum of the Economic and Social Council, along with recent initiatives such as the high-level forums on aid effectiveness, which produced the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the 2008 Accra Agenda for Action,15 make important contributions to the efforts of those countries which have committed to them, including through the adoption of the fundamental principles of national ownership, alignment, harmonization and managing for results. We also bear in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all formula that will guarantee effective assistance and that the specific situation of each country needs to be fully considered. 
65.	We encourage continued efforts in the Development Cooperation Forum, as the focal point within the United Nations system, to carry out a holistic consideration of issues related to international development cooperation, with the participation of all relevant stakeholders. 
66.	We consider that the cultural dimension is important for development. We encourage international cooperation in the cultural field, aimed at achieving development objectives. 
67.	We recognize that sport, as a tool for education, development and peace, can promote cooperation, solidarity, tolerance, understanding, social inclusion and health at the local, national and international levels. 
68.	We recognize that all countries require adequate, timely, reliable and disaggregated data, including demographic data, in order to design better programmes and policies for sustainable development. We commit ourselves to strengthening our national statistical systems, including for effectively monitoring progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. We also reiterate the need to increase efforts in support of statistical capacity-building in developing countries. 
69.	We take note of the Global Pulse initiative to develop more up-to-date and actionable data as a joint effort among all relevant stakeholders for rapid impact and vulnerability analysis. 

		Millennium Development Goal 1 - Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger

70.	We commit ourselves to accelerating progress in order to achieve Millennium Development Goal 1, including by: 
	(a)	Addressing the root causes of extreme poverty and hunger, while noting that the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger has a direct impact on the achievement of all the other Millennium Development Goals;
	(b)	Adopting forward-looking economic policies that lead to sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development, and which increase employment opportunities, promote agricultural development and reduce poverty;
	(c)	Increasing efforts at all levels to mitigate the social and economic impacts, particularly on poverty and hunger, of the multiple crises through global responses that are comprehensive, effective, inclusive and sustainable, taking into account the needs of developing countries; 
	(d)	Pursuing job-intensive, sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development to promote full and productive employment and decent work for all, including for women, indigenous people, young people, people with disabilities and rural populations, and promoting small- and medium-sized enterprises through initiatives such as skills enhancement and technical training programmes, vocational training and entrepreneurial skills development. Employers and workers' representatives should be closely associated with these initiatives; 
	(e)	Improving opportunities for young people to gain access to productive employment and decent work through increased investment in youth employment, active labour-market support and public-private partnerships, as well as through the creation of enabling environments to facilitate the participation of young people in labour markets, in accordance with international rules and commitments; 
	(f)	Taking appropriate steps to assist one another in the elimination of the worst forms of child labour, strengthening child protection systems and combating trafficking in children through, inter alia, enhanced international cooperation and assistance, including support for social and economic development, poverty eradication programmes and universal education; 
	(g)	Promoting comprehensive systems of social protection that provide universal access to essential social services, consistent with national priorities and circumstances, by establishing a minimum level of social security and health care for all; 
	(h)	Promoting inclusive financial services, particularly microfinance, and including affordable and accessible credit, savings, insurance and payments products for all segments of society, especially women, people in vulnerable situations and those who would not normally be served, or are underserved, by traditional financial institutions, as well as for micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises;
	(i)	Promoting the empowerment and participation of rural women as critical agents for enhancing agricultural and rural development and food security and ensuring their equal access to productive resources, land, financing, technologies, training and markets; 
	(j)	Reaffirming the international commitment to eliminating hunger and to securing access to food for all and reiterating, in this regard, the important role of relevant organizations, particularly the United Nations system; 
	(k)	Supporting the Five Rome Principles for Sustainable Global Food Security contained in the Declaration of the World Summit on Food Security;16 
	(l)	Strengthening international coordination and governance for food security, through the Global Partnership for Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition, of which the Committee on World Food Security is a central component, and reiterating that it is essential to enhance global governance, building on existing institutions and fostering effective partnerships; 
	(m)	Promoting efforts to improve capacity-building in sustainable fisheries management, especially in developing countries, as fish is an important source of animal protein for millions of people and is an essential component in the fight against malnutrition and hunger; 
	(n)	Supporting a comprehensive and coordinated response to address the multiple and complex causes of the global food crisis, including the adoption of political, economic, social, financial and technical solutions in the short, medium and long term by national Governments and the international community, including for mitigating the impact of the high volatility of food prices on developing countries.

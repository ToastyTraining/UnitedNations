Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 2 December 2008
[on the report of the First Committee (A/63/390)]
63/80.	United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa


	The General Assembly,
	Mindful of the provisions of Article 11, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations stipulating that a function of the General Assembly is to consider the general principles of cooperation in the maintenance of international peace and security, including the principles governing disarmament and arms limitation,
	Recalling its resolutions 40/151 G of 16 December 1985, 41/60 D of 3 December 1986, 42/39 J of 30 November 1987 and 43/76 D of 7 December 1988 on the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa, and its resolutions 46/36 F of 6 December 1991 and 47/52 G of 9 December 1992 on regional disarmament, including confidence-building measures,
	Recalling also its resolutions 48/76 E of 16 December 1993, 49/76 D of 15 December 1994, 50/71 C of 12 December 1995, 51/46 E of 10 December 1996, 52/220 of 22 December 1997, 53/78 C of 4 December 1998, 54/55 B of 1 December 1999, 55/34 D of 20 November 2000, 56/25 D of 29 November 2001, 57/91 of 22 November 2002, 58/61 of 8 December 2003, 59/101 of 3 December 2004, 60/86 of 8 December 2005, 61/93 of 6 December 2006 and 62/216 of 22 December 2007,
	Aware of the role of the Regional Centre in promoting confidence-building and arms-limitation measures at the regional level,
	Taking into account the need to establish close cooperation between the Regional Centre and the Peace and Security Council of the African Union, in particular its institutions in the field of peace, disarmament and security, as well as with relevant United Nations bodies and programmes in Africa for greater effectiveness,
	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,1  in which he stated that an increase in the Regional Centre's human and operational capacity would enable it to discharge its mandate in full and to respond more effectively to requests for assistance from African States,
	Deeply concerned that, as noted in the report of the Secretary-General, despite the decision taken in Khartoum in January 2006 by the Executive Council of the African Union, in which the Council called upon member States to make voluntary contributions to the Regional Centre to maintain its operations, no such funds have been received to ensure its operations,2
	Recalling that, in its resolution 60/86, it requested the Secretary-General to establish, within existing resources, a consultative mechanism of interested States, in particular African States, for the reorganization of the Regional Centre,
	Taking note of the concrete recommendations on the Regional Centre's future work programme, as well as on its staffing and funding, made by the Consultative Mechanism for the Reorganization of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa upon the conclusion of its work,3
	1.	Notes the implementation of the recommendations of the Consultative Mechanism for the Reorganization of the United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa to fund the Centre's operating costs and three new posts from the regular budget of the Organization;4
	2.	Notes with appreciation the efforts of the Regional Centre to align its actions with the priorities identified in the recommendations of the Consultative Mechanism;
	3.	Welcomes the undertaking by the Regional Centre of new initiatives and projects in the fields of security sector reform and practical disarmament measures, as detailed in the report of the Secretary-General;1
	4.	Urges all States, as well as international governmental and non-governmental organizations and foundations, to make voluntary contributions to strengthen the programmes and activities of the Regional Centre and facilitate their implementation;
	5.	Urges, in particular, States members of the African Union to make voluntary contributions to the Regional Centre's trust funds in conformity with the decision taken by the Executive Council of the African Union, in Khartoum in January 2006;2
	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to facilitate closer cooperation between the Regional Centre and the African Union, in particular in the areas of peace, security and development;
	7.	Also requests the Secretary-General to continue to provide the necessary support to the Regional Centre for greater achievements and results;
	8.	Further requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session on the implementation of the present resolution;
	9.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-fourth session the item entitled "United Nations Regional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in Africa".

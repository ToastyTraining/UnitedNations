	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming the obligation of all States to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, and guided by the purposes and principles of the Charter,
	Reaffirming also that discrimination on the basis of sex is contrary to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women1 and other international human rights instruments and that its elimination is an integral part of efforts towards the elimination of all forms of violence against women,
	Reaffirming further the obligations of States parties to the Convention on the Rights of the Child,2 the Geneva Conventions of 19493 and the Additional Protocols thereto, of 19774 and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,5

	Recalling all previous General Assembly resolutions on violence against women and violence against children, including resolution 61/143 of 19 December 2006 on intensification of efforts to eliminate all forms of violence against women, and its other relevant resolutions, as well as Security Council resolutions 1325 (2000) of 31 October 2000 on women and peace and security, 1612 (2005) of 26 July 2005 on children affected by armed conflict and 1674 (2006) of 28 April 2006 on the protection of civilians in armed conflict, the resolutions of the Economic and Social Council on women and on the girl child, Commission on Human Rights resolution 2005/41 of 19 April 2005 on the elimination of violence against women8 and resolution 2001/20 of 16 August 2001 of the Subcommission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights on systematic rape, sexual slavery and slavery-like practices,9
	Recalling also the inclusion of rape and other forms of gender-related crimes and crimes of sexual violence in the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court,10
	Recalling further the recognition by the ad hoc international criminal tribunals that rape can constitute a war crime, a crime against humanity, or a constitutive act with respect to genocide,
	Welcoming the United Nations inter-agency initiative "Stop Rape Now: United Nations Action against Sexual Violence in Conflict",
	Recognizing that violence against women is an offence against the dignity and integrity of the victim, which often inflicts serious physical and psychological harm, and that all forms of violence against women seriously violate and impair or nullify the enjoyment by women of all human rights and fundamental freedoms and constitute a major impediment to the ability of women to make use of their capabilities,
	Recognizing also that violence against women is rooted in historically unequal power relations between men and women,
	Recognizing further that violence against women impedes the social and economic development of communities and States, as well as the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals,
	Expressing concern that civilians, particularly women and children, account for the vast majority of those adversely affected by armed conflict, including as refugees and internally displaced persons, and increasingly are targeted by combatants and armed elements, and recognizing the consequent impact this has on durable peace and reconciliation,
	Recognizing that States bear primary responsibility to respect and ensure the human rights of their citizens, as well as all individuals within their territory as provided for by relevant international law,
	Stressing that States have the obligation to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms of women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and punish the perpetrators of violence against women and girls, and to provide protection to the victims, and that failure to do so violates and impairs or nullifies the enjoyment of the human rights and fundamental freedoms of the victims,
	Strongly condemning all acts of violence against women and girls, whether these acts are perpetrated by the State, by private persons or by non-State actors, calling for the elimination of all forms of gender-based violence in the family, within the general community, and where perpetrated or condoned by the State, and stressing the need to treat all forms of violence against women and girls as a criminal offence, punishable by law,
	Stressing that rape or other forms of sexual violence must not be used or condoned in any circumstance by any individual, State or non-State actor,
	Recognizing that rape or any other form of sexual violence is unlawful in all circumstances and in all places, regardless of the sex or age of the victim, including in detention and in jails, whether or not committed by State or non-State actors in the course of achieving political or military objectives, whether or not in the course of an international or non-international armed conflict, or in areas under foreign occupation,
	Deeply concerned at rape and other forms of sexual violence in all their manifestations, which are typically committed against women and girls, and which often target victims associated with communities, ethnic groups or other groups regarded as antagonistic to or insufficiently supportive of the group or entity whose forces commit the crime, and are frequently calculated to humiliate, dominate, instil fear in, disperse and/or forcibly relocate members of such groups, including, but not limited to, the victims and their families,
	Affirming the need for States to ensure that perpetrators of rape or other forms of sexual violence committed on their territory do not operate with impunity and that the perpetrators of such acts are brought to justice as provided for by national law and obligations under international law, and also affirming the need to penalize persons in authority found guilty of sexually assaulting victims,

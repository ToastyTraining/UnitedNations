	Recalling that, amid expressions of popular discontent over restrictions on the enjoyment of civil, political, economic and social rights, civilian protests erupted in Dar'a in March 2011, and noting that the excessive and violent oppression of civilian protests by the Syrian authorities, which later escalated to the direct shelling of civilian population areas, fuelled the escalation of armed violence and extremist groups, including so-called ISIL (also known as Da'esh),
	Expressing outrage at the escalation of violence in the Syrian Arab Republic, in particular in Aleppo, and the extensive and persistent violations of international humanitarian law and violations and abuses of international human rights law, including those involving the indiscriminate killing and deliberate targeting of civilians and civilian infrastructure, notably through shelling and aerial bombardment, the use of chemical weapons, as concluded by the Joint Investigative Mechanism, and other prohibited weapons, and the use of siege and starvation of civilians as a method of warfare, which have caused profound suffering and loss of life, have created conditions conducive to the rise and spread of terrorism and violent extremism conducive to terrorism and have caused an exodus of Syrian refugees,

	Expressing alarm at the failure to implement relevant Security Council and General Assembly resolutions and the continued disregard for international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and expressing alarm that the responsibility of the Security Council to ensure prompt and effective action has not been further discharged with regard to the Syrian Arab Republic,
	Expressing grave concern at the continued deterioration of the devastating humanitarian situation in the Syrian Arab Republic and the fact that more than 13.5 million people are now in need of humanitarian assistance in the Syrian Arab Republic, expressing grave concern at the increasing number of refugees and internally displaced persons caused by the conflict in the Syrian Arab Republic, including the nearly 6.3 million people who are internally displaced, in addition to the half million Palestinian refugees in the Syrian Arab Republic, expressing the gravest concern at the destabilizing effect of the crisis on the region, underlining the extreme urgency of finding a political solution, and reiterating its appreciation for the significant and admirable efforts that have been made by the countries of the region, notably, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, to accommodate the more than 4.8 million registered refugees who have fled the Syrian Arab Republic as a result of the ongoing violence,
	Expressing grave concern also at the dire situation of the civilian population, in particular of the 974,080 people trapped in besieged areas, as well as the dire situation of nearly 3.9 million people in hard-to-reach areas,
	Strongly condemning and deploring all acts of violence, attacks and threats against the wounded and sick, medical personnel and humanitarian personnel exclusively engaged in medical duties, their means of transport, equipment and supplies, as well as hospitals and other medical facilities, and deploring the long-term consequences of such attacks for the civilian population and the health-care system of the Syrian Arab Republic, 
	Strongly alarmed that attacks against schools, schoolchildren and teachers are commonplace, risking losing a generation as a result of the over 2 million out-of-school children and adolescents and the one in three schools being damaged, destroyed or occupied,
	Deeply concerned by the situation of vulnerable persons, including women and children, who are subjected to discrimination, sexual and gender-based violence, abduction, physical abuse, violation of their privacy and arbitrary arrest and detention, deploring all violations against children, including the recruitment and use of children, and condemning the use by the Syrian authorities and all other parties of enforced disappearances, extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions and torture,
	Recalling the report of the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic of 11 August 2016,14 which reiterated key recommendations calling for all parties to, inter alia, restore and revitalize the cessation of hostilities, minimize civilian casualties and end indiscriminate attacks, allow rapid, safe, sustained, unhindered and unconditional access for humanitarian aid and end all sieges immediately,
	Deeply concerned by the presence of terrorist organizations in the Syrian Arab Republic and the spread of violent extremism conducive to terrorism, strongly condemning all terrorist attacks, abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law carried out by so-called ISIL (also known as Da'esh), Al-Nusrah Front and all other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida or ISIL (also known as Da'esh), and other terrorist groups, as designated by the Security Council, and reiterating the call upon all parties to commit to putting an end to terrorist acts perpetrated by such organizations and individuals, while reaffirming that terrorism in all its forms constitutes one of the most serious threats to international peace and security and that any acts of terrorism are unjustifiable, regardless of their motivation, wherever, whenever and by whomsoever committed,
	Recalling the importance of the principles of distinction and proportionality, which, inter alia, refer to the obligation under international humanitarian law to distinguish between civilian populations and combatants, the prohibition against indiscriminate attacks, and the obligation to do everything feasible to verify that the objects to be attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects and are not subject to special protection, and recalling further the obligation to take all other feasible precautions with a view to avoiding, and in any event minimizing, harm to civilians and civilian objects, including schools, water, medical facilities as such and all other objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population,

	Recalling that all Syrian parties to the conflict shall enable the immediate and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance, and stressing that the arbitrary denial of humanitarian access, depriving civilians of objects and assistance indispensable to their survival, including wilfully impeding relief supplies such as food aid and lifesaving medical supplies, and the use of starvation as a method of warfare may constitute a war crime, 
	Stressing the need to end impunity for serious violations of international humanitarian law and for violations and abuses of international human rights law in the Syrian Arab Republic, some of which may constitute war crimes or crimes against humanity, and re-emphasizing the need for all those responsible to be held accountable, 
	Emphasizing that the humanitarian situation will continue to deteriorate further in the absence of a political solution, and reiterating that the only sustainable solution to the current crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people,
	Reiterating its determination to seek ways and means to protect the Syrian civilian population and persons hors de combat,

	6.	Highlights its demand for the full and immediate implementation of Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), which, inter alia, reiterates that the only sustainable solution to the current crisis in the Syrian Arab Republic is through an inclusive and Syrian-led political process that meets the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people, with a view to full implementation of the Geneva communiqué of 30 June 2012, as endorsed by the Council in resolution 2118 (2013), including through the establishment of an inclusive transitional governing body with full executive powers, which shall be formed on the basis of mutual consent while ensuring continuity of governmental institutions;

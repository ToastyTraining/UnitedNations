	Recalling its resolution 58/269 of 23 December 2003,
	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the proposed programme budget outline for the biennium 2012-20131 and the recommendations contained in the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2 
	1.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;2
	2.	Reaffirms that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the General Assembly entrusted with responsibilities for administrative and budgetary matters;
	3.	Emphasizes that the proposed programme budget outline should be submitted sufficiently early in order that it may serve as a practical tool in the budget preparation process and, in this regard, requests the Secretary-General to issue future budget outlines at least thirty days prior to their scheduled introduction, but no later than 15 November of the off-budget year;
	4.	Reaffirms that the budget outline should provide a greater level of predictability of resources required for the following biennium and promote greater involvement of Member States in the budgetary process, thereby facilitating the broadest possible agreement on the programme budget;
	5.	Also reaffirms that the proposed programme budget outline shall contain an indication of the following:
	(a)	A preliminary estimate of resources needed to accommodate the proposed programme of activities during the biennium;
	(b)	Priorities, reflecting general trends of a broad sectoral nature;
	(c)	Real growth, positive or negative, compared with the previous budget;
	(d)	Size of the contingency fund expressed as a percentage of the overall level of resources;
	6.	Notes that the budget proposal will reflect the benefit of further reviews of possible obsolete activities, additional cost-effective measures and simplified procedures and, in this regard, requests the Secretary-General to rigorously pursue this in accordance with regulation 5.6 of the Regulations and Rules Governing Programme Planning, the Programme Aspects of the Budget, the Monitoring of Implementation and the Methods of Evaluation,3 and established practices;
	7.	Reaffirms that the budget proposals of the Secretary-General should reflect resource levels commensurate with mandates for their full, efficient and effective implementation;
	8.	Stresses that the budget outline is a preliminary estimate of resources;
	9.	Invites the Secretary-General to prepare his proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013 on the basis of a preliminary estimate of 5,396,697,200 United States dollars at revised 2010-2011 rates;
	10.	Decides that the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013 shall contain provisions for re-costing on the basis of the existing methodology;
	11.	Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to include, in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013, the total amount of resources that he should have at his disposal, from all sources of financing, in order to implement fully all mandated programmes and activities;
	12.	Notes that the preliminary estimates provided by the Secretary-General for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013 do not include provisions for the implementation of those requirements that are under discussion by the General Assembly and that the requirements pertinent to the regular budget should be reflected in the programme budget for the biennium 2012-2013, subject to approval by the Assembly and in accordance with its resolutions 41/213 of 19 December 1986 and 42/211 of 21 December 1987;

	15.	Reaffirms its request to the Secretary-General to propose, in future budget submissions, measures to offset budget increases, wherever possible, without undermining the implementation of mandated programmes and activities;
	16.	Decides that the contingency fund shall be set at the level of 0.75 per cent of the preliminary estimate, namely, at 40,475,200 dollars, that this amount shall be in addition to the overall level of the preliminary estimate, and that it shall be used in accordance with the procedures for the use and operation of the contingency fund.

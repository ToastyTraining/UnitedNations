	Also recognizing the urgent need for scaling up national malaria control programmes if African countries are to meet the intermediate target set by the Abuja Summit for the five-year period of 2000-2005,
	Further recognizing that malaria-related ill health and deaths throughout the world can be eliminated with political commitment and commensurate resources if the public is educated and sensitized about malaria and appropriate health services are made available, particularly in countries where the disease is endemic,
	Emphasizing the importance of implementing the Millennium Declaration, and welcoming in this connection the commitment of Member States to respond to the specific needs of Africa,
	Commending the efforts of the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund and other partners to fight malaria over the years, including the launching of the Roll Back Malaria Partnership in 1998,

	4.	Urges malaria-endemic countries to increase domestic resource allocation to malaria control;
	5.	Encourages all African countries that have not yet done so to implement the recommendations of the Abuja Summit to reduce or waive taxes and tariffs for nets and other products needed for malaria control, both to reduce the price of nets to consumers and to stimulate free trade in insecticide-treated nets;

Calls upon the international community to support ways of stimulating the development of manufacturing capacity of insecticide-treated nets in Africa and, in this connection, to encourage and facilitate the transfer of technology needed to make insecticide-treated nets more effective and long-lasting;

	10.	Requests the Secretary-General, in close collaboration with the World Health Organization, developing countries and regional organizations, including the African Union, to conduct in 2005 an evaluation of the measures taken and progress made towards the achievement of the mid-term targets, the means of implementation provided by the international community in this regard and the overall goals of the Decade, and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session;

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/52/654)]


52/166.Amendment to article 13 of the statute of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the note by the Secretary-General dated 17 September 1997 entitled "Amendment to article 13 of the statute of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal",1

	Noting the proposal of the International Court of Justice referred to in that note that the statute of the Tribunal should be modified to provide for the exercise of its competence in respect of the staff of the Registry of the International Court of Justice,

	Recognizing that the competence of the Tribunal in United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund cases, as approved by the General Assembly in resolution 955 (X) of 3 November 1955, is not reflected in the statute of the Tribunal, 

	Noting the proposal of the Secretary-General, set out in the note, to amend the statute of the Tribunal by providing that its competence may be extended to international organizations and entities participating in the common system of conditions of service,

	Desiring to amend the statute of the Tribunal in accordance with the proposals referred to in the note by the Secretary-General,

	Convinced of the desirability of reviewing more generally the provisions of the statute of the Tribunal at an early date,


	1.	Decides to amend article 13 of the statute of the United Nations Administrative Tribunal, with effect from 1 January 1998, as follows:

	(a)	The following new paragraphs shall be added as paragraphs 1, 2 and 4:

"1.	The competence of the Tribunal shall be extended to the staff of the Registry of the International Court of Justice upon the exchange of letters between the President of the Court and the Secretary-General of the United Nations establishing the relevant conditions.

"2.	The Tribunal shall be competent to hear and pass judgement upon applications alleging non-observance of the regulations of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Fund arising out of the decision of the United Nations Joint Staff Pension Board submitted to the Tribunal by:

	"(a) Any staff member of a member organization of the Pension Fund which has accepted the jurisdiction of the Tribunal in Pension Fund cases who is eligible under article 21 of the regulations of the Fund as a participant in the Fund, even if his employment has ceased, and any person who has acceded to such staff member's rights upon his death;

	"(b) Any other person who can show that he is entitled to rights under the regulations of the Pension Fund by virtue of the participation in the Fund of a staff member of such member organization.

"4.	The competence of the Tribunal may also be extended, with the approval of the General Assembly, to any other international organization or entity established by a treaty and participating in the common system of conditions of service, upon the terms set out in a special agreement between the organization or entity concerned and the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Each such special agreement shall provide that the organization or entity concerned shall be bound by the judgements of the Tribunal and be responsible for the payment of any compensation awarded by the Tribunal in respect of a staff member of that organization or entity and shall include, inter alia, provisions concerning its participation in the administrative arrangements for the functioning of the Tribunal and concerning its sharing the expenses of the Tribunal.";

	(b)	The text of former article 13 shall become paragraph 3 of amended article 13;

	2.	Also decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-third session an item entitled "Review of the statute of the Administrative Tribunal of the United Nations".

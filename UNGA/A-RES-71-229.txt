	The General Assembly, 
	Recalling its resolution 70/206 of 22 December 2015, as well as other resolutions relating to the implementation of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa,1
	Reaffirming its resolution 70/1 of 25 September 2015, entitled "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development", in which it adopted a comprehensive, far-reaching and people-centred set of universal and transformative Sustainable Development Goals and targets, its commitment to working tirelessly for the full implementation of the Agenda by 2030, its recognition that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, its commitment to achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions - economic, social and environmental - in a balanced and integrated manner, and to building upon the achievements of the Millennium Development Goals and seeking to address their unfinished business, 
	Reaffirming also its resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development, which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, supports and complements it, helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with concrete policies and actions, and reaffirms the strong political commitment to address the challenge of financing and creating an enabling environment at all levels for sustainable development in the spirit of global partnership and solidarity, 
	Welcoming the Paris Agreement2 and its early entry into force, encouraging all its parties to fully implement the Agreement, and parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change3 that have not yet done so to deposit their instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession, where appropriate, as soon as possible, 
	Recalling that, in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the international community committed to combating desertification, restoring degraded land and soil, including land affected by desertification, drought and floods, and striving to achieve a land-degradation-neutral world by 2030, 
	Taking note of resolution 2/24 of 27 May 2016, entitled "Combating desertification, land degradation and drought and promoting sustainable pastoralism and rangelands", adopted by the United Nations Environment Assembly of the United Nations Environment Programme at its second session,4
	Noting that the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and targets, including Goal 15 and target 15.3, would serve as an accelerator to ending poverty and hunger, tackling inequality, empowering women and stimulating economic growth, 
	Noting also that combating desertification, land degradation and drought, including through sustainable land management, can contribute to easing forced migration flows influenced by a number of factors, including economic, social, security and environmental concerns, which can, in turn, reduce current and potential fighting over resources in degraded areas, 
	Acknowledging that striving to achieve land degradation neutrality would significantly contribute to the three dimensions of sustainable development through the rehabilitation, restoration, conservation and sustainable management of land resources, and that this could potentially involve the development of voluntary national targets, in accordance with the specific national circumstances, 
	Noting that desertification, land degradation, drought, human activities5 and climate change are closely related and that, if not addressed, they would pose a serious challenge to sustainable development for all countries, in particular developing countries,

	Noting the scientific findings of the third Scientific Conference of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa, on the interlinkages between desertification and/or land degradation and climate change and their effects on human well-being, 
	Recognizing that healthy grassland and rangeland ecosystems can play a significant role in the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,

	5.	Reiterates that the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development reaffirmed women's vital role and their full and equal participation and leadership in all areas of sustainable development, and in this regard invites donors and international organizations, including the organizations of the United Nations system, as well as the international financial institutions, regional banks and major groups, including the private sector, to fully integrate their commitments and their considerations on gender equality and women's empowerment and to ensure the participation of women and effective gender mainstreaming in their decision-making in combating desertification, land degradation and drought, ensuring that women and men have equal access to and are equal beneficiaries of resources, capacity-building, information and technology and that their needs and contributions are equally taken into account;

	8.	Recognizes the benefits gained from cooperation through the sharing of climate and weather information, forecasting and early warning systems related to desertification, land degradation and drought, while also taking account of dust storms and sandstorms, at the global, regional and subregional levels, and in this regard likewise recognizes the need for further cooperation between States and relevant organizations in the sharing of related information, forecasting and early warning systems;

	11.	Reiterates that degraded land, if recovered, would, inter alia, contribute to restoring natural resources, thus potentially improving food security and nutrition in the affected countries, and in the process could, inter alia, contribute to the absorption of carbon emissions; 
	12.	Takes note of the action already taken by the secretariat of the Convention in leading and coordinating global partnership processes relevant to the voluntary land degradation neutrality target setting programme at the national level to be coordinated by Governments, in accordance with their specific national circumstances, and the development of methodology and data options by the inter-agency advisory group to contribute to the work of the Inter-Agency and Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators;

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the budget performance of the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2014 to 30 June 20151 and on the budget for the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017,2 the report of the Independent Audit Advisory Committee on the proposed budget of the Office of Internal Oversight Services under the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 20173 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,4 
	Recognizing the importance of the United Nations being able to respond and deploy rapidly to a peacekeeping operation upon the adoption of a relevant resolution of the Security Council, within 30 days for traditional peacekeeping operations and 90 days for complex peacekeeping operations,
	Recognizing also the need for adequate support during all phases of peacekeeping operations, including the liquidation and termination phases,
	Mindful that the level of the support account should broadly correspond to the mandate, number, size and complexity of peacekeeping missions,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the budget for the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 20172 and the report of the Independent Audit Advisory Committee on the proposed budget for the Office of Internal Oversight Services under the support account for peacekeeping operations for the period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017;3
	2.	Reaffirms its role in carrying out a thorough analysis and approval of human and financial resources and policies with a view to ensuring the full, effective and efficient implementation of all mandated programmes and activities and the implementation of policies in this regard;
	3.	Also reaffirms that the Fifth Committee is the appropriate Main Committee of the General Assembly entrusted with responsibility for administrative and budgetary matters;
	4.	Further reaffirms rule 153 of its rules of procedure;
	5.	Reaffirms that the support account funds shall be used for the sole purpose of financing human resources and non-human resources requirements for backstopping and supporting peacekeeping operations at Headquarters, and that any changes in this limitation require the prior approval of the General Assembly;
	6.	Also reaffirms the need for adequate funding for the backstopping of peacekeeping operations, as well as the need for full justification for that funding in support account budget submissions;
	7.	Further reaffirms the need for effective and efficient administration and financial management of peacekeeping operations, and urges the Secretary-General to continue to identify measures to increase the productivity and efficiency of the support account;
	8.	Requests the Secretary-General to ensure the full implementation of the relevant provisions of its resolutions 59/296 of 22 June 2005, 60/266 of 30 June 2006, 61/276 of 29 June 2007, 64/269 of 24 June 2010, 65/289 of 30 June 2011, 66/264 of 21 June 2012, 69/307 of 25 June 2015 and 70/286 of 17 June 2016 and its other relevant resolutions;
	9.	Endorses the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,4 subject to the provisions of the present resolution, and requests the Secretary-General to ensure their full implementation; 
	10.	Recalls paragraphs 11, 13 and 18 of the report of the Advisory Committee, emphasizes that support functions should be scalable to the number, size and scope of peacekeeping operations, and in this regard requests the Secretary-General to present, at the second part of the resumed seventy-second session of the General Assembly, a comprehensive review of the support account to ensure that the support account broadly corresponds to the evolving mandate, number, size and complexity of peacekeeping missions and to the implementation of organizational transformation initiatives;
	11.	Also recalls paragraph 13 of the report of the Advisory Committee, and notes with concern the continued upward shift in the grade structure of the United Nations Secretariat;

	13.

	14.	Reaffirms that the use of external consultants should be kept to an absolute minimum and that their services should be used only when necessary, and stresses the need for using the in-house capacity of the Organization to perform core activities or to fulfil functions that are recurrent over the long term;
	15.	Decides to maintain, for the financial period from 1 July 2016 to 30 June 2017, the funding mechanism for the support account used in the current period, from 1 July 2015 to 30 June 2016, as approved in paragraph 3 of its resolution 50/221 B;

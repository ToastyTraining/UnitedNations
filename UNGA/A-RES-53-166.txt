Agenda item 110 (d)

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Third Committee (A/53/625/Add.4)

53/166. 	Comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action	

    The General Assembly,

    Recalling its resolution 48/121 of 20 December 1993, in which it endorsed the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights, held at Vienna from 14 to 25 June 1993,1 as well as its subsequent resolutions on this matter, in particular resolution 52/148 of 12 December 1997,

    Recalling also paragraph 100 of section II of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action concerning the five-year review of progress made in the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, including the need to pay special attention to assessing the progress towards the goal of universal ratification of international human rights treaties and protocols adopted within the framework of the United Nations system,

    Recognizing that the five-year implementation review of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, carried out on the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,2 has provided an opportunity to strengthen the promotion and protection of human rights,

    Reaffirming that human rights and fundamental freedoms are the birthright of all human beings, that their promotion and protection is the first responsibility of Governments, and that all human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated,
    
    Convinced that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action has to be translated into effective action by States, the competent United Nations organs and organizations and other organizations concerned, including non-governmental organizations,

    Welcoming the significant steps taken over the past five years at both national and international levels to implement the recommendations made by the World Conference on Human Rights, 

    Deeply concerned, however, about the wide gap that continues to exist between the promise of human rights and their promotion and protection worldwide, and deeply concerned also about denials and violations of human rights - civil, cultural, economic, political and social - including the right to development,

    Reaffirming the important role of non-governmental organizations in the promotion of all human rights and in humanitarian activities at the national, regional and international levels, and appreciating their contribution to increasing public awareness of human rights issues, to the conduct of education, training and research in this field, and to the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms,

    Noting that the Economic and Social Council devoted the coordination segment of its substantive session of 1998 to the question of the coordinated follow-up to and implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action by the United Nations system,3

    1.	Takes note of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights4 on the implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action1 and the conclusions contained therein; 

    2.	Solemnly declares its commitment to the fulfilment of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action ;

    3.	Welcomes agreed conclusions 1998/2 of the Economic and Social Council5 on the coordinated follow-up to and implementation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, and calls for their full implementation; 

    4.	Reaffirms that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action continues to constitute a solid foundation for further action and initiatives by States, the United Nations and other relevant intergovernmental bodies and organizations, as well as concerned national institutions and non-governmental organizations;

    5.	Calls upon all States to take further action with a view to the full realization of all human rights for all in the light of the recommendations of the World Conference on Human Rights;

    6.	Decides to continue its consideration of this question at its fifty-fourth session under the sub-item entitled "Comprehensive implementation of and follow-up to the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action".

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 2 December 2008
[on the report of the First Committee (A/63/389)]
63/41.	Decreasing the operational readiness of nuclear weapons systems


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 62/36 of 5 December 2007,
	Recalling also that the maintenance of nuclear weapons on high alert was a feature of cold war nuclear postures, and welcoming the increased confidence and transparency since the cessation of the cold war,
	Concerned that, notwithstanding the end of the cold war, several thousand nuclear weapons remain on high alert, ready to be launched within minutes,
	Noting the increased engagement in multilateral disarmament forums in support of further reductions to the operational status of nuclear weapons systems,
	Recognizing that the maintenance of nuclear weapons systems at a high level of readiness increases the risk of the use of such weapons, including the unintentional or accidental use, which would have catastrophic consequences,
	Recognizing also that reductions in deployments and the lowering of operational status contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, as well as to the process of nuclear disarmament, through the enhancement of confidence-building and transparency measures and a diminishing role for nuclear weapons in security policies,
	Welcoming bilateral initiatives, such as the proposed United States/Russian Federation Joint Centre for the Exchange of Data from Early Warning Systems and Notification of Missile Launches, which can play a central role in operational status reduction processes,
	Welcoming also the steps taken by some States to reduce the operational status of their nuclear weapons systems, including de-targeting initiatives and increasing the amount of preparation time required for deployment,
	1.	Calls for further practical steps to be taken to decrease the operational readiness of nuclear weapons systems, with a view to ensuring that all nuclear weapons are removed from high alert status;
	2.	Urges States to update the General Assembly on progress made in the implementation of the present resolution;
	3.	Decides to remain seized of the matter.

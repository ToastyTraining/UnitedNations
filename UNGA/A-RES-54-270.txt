	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/54/901)]


54/270.	Financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus

    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus1 and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

    Recalling Security Council resolution 186 (1964) of 4 March 1964, by which the Council established the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force, the latest of which was resolution 1303 (2000) of 14 June 2000,

    Recalling also its resolution 53/231 of 8 June 1999 on the financing of the Force,

    Reaffirming that the costs of the Force that are not covered by voluntary contributions are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force by certain Governments,


    Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Expressing its appreciation to all those Member States and observer States which have made voluntary contributions to the Special Account established for the financing of the Force for the period prior to 16 June 1993,

    Noting that voluntary contributions were insufficient to cover all the costs of the Force, including those incurred by troop-contributing Governments prior to 16 June 1993, and regretting the absence of an adequate response to appeals for voluntary contributions, including that contained in the letter dated 17 May 1994 from the Secretary-General to all Member States,3

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

    1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus as at 30 April 2000, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 17.7 million United States dollars, representing some 11.2 per cent of the total assessed contributions from 16 June 1993 to the period ending 15 June 2000, notes that some 22 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

    2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursements to troop contributors that bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

    3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

    4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Force in full and on time;

    5.	Expresses concern at the delay experienced by the Secretary-General in deploying and providing adequate resources to some recent peacekeeping missions, in particular those in Africa;


    6.	Emphasizes that all future and existing peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements;

    7.	Also emphasizes that all peacekeeping missions shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates;

    8.	Requests the Secretary-General to make the fullest possible use of facilities and equipment at the United Nations Logistics Base at Brindisi, Italy, in order to minimize the costs of procurement for the Force, and for this purpose requests the Secretary-General to speed up the implementation of the asset management system at all peacekeeping missions in accordance with General Assembly resolution 52/1 A of 15 October 1997;

    9.	Endorses the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,4 and requests the Secretary-General to ensure their full implementation;

    10.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Force is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

    11.	Also requests the Secretary-General, in order to reduce the cost of employing General Service staff, to continue efforts to recruit local staff for the Force against General Service posts, commensurate with the requirements of the Force;

    12.	Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus the amount of 43,422,065 dollars gross (41,404,128 dollars net) for the maintenance of the Force for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, inclusive of the amount of 2,060,180 dollars gross (1,743,344 dollars net) for the support account for peacekeeping operations, and the amount of 322,085 dollars gross (286,584 dollars net) for the United Nations Logistics Base;

    13.	Decides also, as an ad hoc arrangement, taking into consideration the funding through voluntary contributions of one third of the cost of the Force, equivalent to 13,801,375 dollars, by the Government of Cyprus and the annual pledge of 6.5 million dollars from the Government of Greece, to apportion among Member States the amount of 23,120,690 dollars gross (21,102,753 dollars net) for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001, at a monthly rate of 1,926,724 dollars gross (1,758,563 dollars net), in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996, 51/218 A to C of 18 December 1996 and 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993, 50/451 B of 23 December 1995 and 54/456 to 54/458 of 23 December 1999, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the year 2000, as set out in its resolutions 52/215 A of 22 December 1997 and 54/237 A of 23 December 1999, and for the year 2001,5 subject to the decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the Force;


    14.	Decides further that, in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955, there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 13 above, their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated staff assessment income of 2,017,937 dollars approved for the Force for the period from 1 July 2000 to 30 June 2001;

    15.	Decides that, for Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Force, there shall be set off against the apportionment, as provided for in paragraph 13 above, their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 374,000 dollars gross (421,700 dollars net) in respect of the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999;

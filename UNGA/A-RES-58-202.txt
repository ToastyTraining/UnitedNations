Underlines the importance of promoting international financial stability and sustainable growth, and welcomes the efforts undertaken to this end by the International Monetary Fund and the Financial Stability Forum, as well as the International Monetary and Financial Committee's consideration of ways to sharpen tools designed to promote international financial stability and enhance crisis prevention, including through an even-handed implementation of surveillance and a sharpening of surveillance on capital markets and systemically and regionally important countries, with a view, inter alia, to early identification of problems and risks and the fostering of appropriate policy responses; the provision of adequate precautionary support to deal with external crises; and further improvements in the transparency of macroeconomic data and statistical information on international capital flows;
	8.	Reiterates in this regard that measures to mitigate the impact of excessive volatility of short-term capital flows and to improve transparency of and information about financial flows are important and must be considered;
	9.	Notes the impact of financial crises and risks of contagion on developing countries and countries with economies in transition, regardless of their size, and underlines the need to ensure that the international financial institutions, including the International Monetary Fund, have a suitable array of financial facilities and resources to respond in a timely and appropriate way, in accordance with their policies, to such crises;

Emphasizes that it is essential to ensure the effective and equitable participation of developing countries in the formulation of financial standards and codes, and underscores the need to ensure their implementation, on a voluntary and progressive basis, as a contribution to reducing vulnerability to financial crisis and contagion;
	13.	Invites the multilateral and regional development banks and development funds to continue to play a vital role in serving the development needs of developing countries and countries with economies in transition, including through coordinated action, as appropriate, and stresses that strengthened regional development banks and subregional financial institutions add flexible financial support to national and regional development efforts, enhancing their ownership and overall efficiency, and are an essential source of knowledge and expertise for their developing country members;
	14.	Calls upon multilateral financial institutions, in providing policy advice and financial support to member countries, to work on the basis of nationally-owned reform and development strategies, to pay due regard to the special needs and implementing capacities of developing countries and countries with economies in transition and to minimize the negative impacts of the adjustment programmes on the vulnerable segments of society, while taking into account the importance of gender-sensitive employment and poverty eradication policies and strategies;
	15.

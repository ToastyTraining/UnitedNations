Resolution adopted by the General Assembly
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/56/581)]
56/268.	Measures to be taken against political platforms and activities based on doctrines of superiority and violent nationalist ideologies which are based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and xenophobia, including neo-Nazism


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling that the United Nations emerged from the struggle against Nazism, fascism, aggression and foreign occupation, and that the people expressed their resolve in the Charter of the United Nations to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,
	Aware of the determination proclaimed by the peoples of the world in the Charter to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small and to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom,
	Convinced that any doctrine of superiority based on racial differentiation is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous, and that there is no justification for racial discrimination, in theory or in practice, anywhere,
	Welcoming the fact that the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, held at Durban, South Africa, from 31 August to 8 September 2001, condemned political platforms and organizations based on racism, xenophobia or doctrines of racial superiority and related discrimination, as well as legislation and practices based on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, as incompatible with democracy and transparent and accountable governance,
	Noting with regret that, in the contemporary world, there continue to exist various manifestations of neo-Nazi activities, as well as other political platforms and activities based on doctrines of superiority and violent nationalist ideologies which are based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and xenophobia, which entail contempt for the individual or a denial of the intrinsic dignity and equality of all human beings and of equality of opportunity in the civil, political, economic and social and cultural spheres and in social justice,
	Deeply alarmed at the persistence and resurgence of these phenomena, and stating that they can never be justified in any instance or under any circumstances,
	Noting with concern the widening misuse by such groups and organizations of the opportunities provided by scientific and technological progress, including the Internet, to promote racist and xenophobic propaganda aimed at inciting racial hatred and to collect funds to sustain violent campaigns against multi-ethnic societies throughout the world,
	Noting that the use of such technologies can also contribute to combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,
	Expressing serious concern at the rise in many parts of the world of doctrines of superiority and violent nationalist ideologies which are based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and xenophobia,
	Particularly alarmed at the rise of such ideas in political circles, in the sphere of public opinion and in society at large,
	Recognizing the important role relevant regional bodies, including regional associations of national human rights institutions, can play in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and the key role they can play in monitoring and raising awareness about intolerance and discrimination at the regional level, and reaffirming support for such bodies where they exist, and encouraging their establishment, 
	Recalling its resolutions 2331 (XXII) of 18 December 1967, 2545 (XXIV) of 11 December 1969, 35/200 of 15 December 1980, 36/162 of 16 December 1981, 37/179 of 17 December 1982, 38/99 of 16 December 1983, 39/114 of 14 December 1984, 41/160 of 4 December 1986, 43/150 of 8 December 1988 and, in particular, resolution 55/82 of 4 December 2000,
	Recalling also Commission on Human Rights resolutions 1983/28 of 7 March 1983,1 1984/42 of 12 March 1984,2 1985/31 of 13 March 1985,3 1986/61 of 13 March 1986,4 1988/63 of 10 March 19885 and 1990/46 of 6 March 1990,6 and taking note of Commission resolutions 2001/5 and 2001/43 of 18 and 23 April 2001,7
	Taking into consideration the report of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance to the Commission on Human Rights,8
	1.	Remains convinced that political platforms and activities based on doctrines of superiority and violent nationalist ideologies which are based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and xenophobia, including neo-Nazism, must be condemned as incompatible with democracy and accountable governance;
	2.	Expresses its determination to resist such political platforms and activities which can undermine the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms and of equality of opportunity;
	3.	Urges States to take all available measures in accordance with their obligations under international human rights instruments to combat political platforms and activities based on doctrines of superiority and violent nationalist ideologies which are based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and xenophobia;
	4.	Calls upon States to undertake and facilitate activities aimed at educating young people in human rights and democratic citizenship and instilling values of solidarity, respect and appreciation of diversity, including respect for different groups, and affirms that a special effort to inform and sensitize young people with regard to democratic values and human rights should be undertaken or developed to fight against ideologies based on the fallacious theory of racial superiority; 
	5.	Urges all States to consider the adoption, as a matter of high priority, of appropriate measures consistent with their national legal systems and in accordance with the provisions of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,9 the International Covenants on Human Rights10 and the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,11 to eradicate activities that lead to violence and condemn any dissemination of ideas based on doctrines of superiority and violent nationalist ideologies which are based on racial discrimination or ethnic exclusiveness and xenophobia, including neo-Nazism;
	6.	Expresses support for the activities of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and calls upon all States to cooperate with him;
	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of the Member States and relevant human rights bodies and mechanisms of the United Nations system.

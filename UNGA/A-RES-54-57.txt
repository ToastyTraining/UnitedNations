	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the First Committee (A/54/566)]


54/57.The risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East

	The General Assembly,

	Bearing in mind its relevant resolutions,

	Taking note of the relevant resolutions adopted by the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the latest of which is resolution GC(43)/RES/23 adopted on 1 October 1999,

	Cognizant that the proliferation of nuclear weapons in the region of the Middle East would pose a serious threat to international peace and security,

	Mindful of the immediate need to place all nuclear facilities in the region of the Middle East under full-scope safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency,

	Recalling the resolution on the Middle East adopted by the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on 11 May 1995,1 in which the Conference noted with concern the continued existence in the Middle East of unsafeguarded nuclear facilities, reaffirmed the importance of the early realization of universal adherence to the Treaty2 and called upon all States in the Middle East that had not yet done so, without exception, to accede to the Treaty as soon as possible and to place all their nuclear facilities under full-scope International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards,


	Recalling also the decision on principles and objectives for nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament adopted by the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons on 11 May 1995,1 in which the Conference urged universal adherence to the Treaty as an urgent priority and called upon all States not yet parties to the Treaty to accede to it at the earliest date, particularly those States that operate unsafeguarded nuclear facilities,

	Noting that, since the adoption of General Assembly resolution 51/48 of 10 December 1996, Israel remains the only State in the Middle East that has not yet become party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,

	Concerned about the threats posed by the proliferation of nuclear weapons to the security and stability of the Middle East region,

	Stressing the importance of taking confidence-building measures, in particular the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in the Middle East, in order to enhance peace and security in the region and to consolidate the global non-proliferation regime,

	Noting the adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty3 and its signature by one hundred and fifty-five States, including a number of States in the region,

	1.	Calls upon the only State in the region that is not party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons2 to accede to the Treaty without further delay and not to develop, produce, test or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons, and to renounce possession of nuclear weapons, and to place all its unsafeguarded nuclear facilities under full-scope International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards as an important confidence-building measure among all States of the region and as a step towards enhancing peace and security;

	2.	Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session on the implementation of the present resolution;

	3.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-fifth session the item entitled "The risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle East".

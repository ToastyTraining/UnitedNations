	Reaffirming its resolution 57/311 of 18 June 2003 on the financial situation of the Institute,
	Welcoming Economic and Social Council resolution 2003/57 of 24 July 2003, in which the Council decided to amend articles III and IV of the statute of the Institute,
	Welcoming also the efforts and the consistency in the work of the Working Group on the Future Operation of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women in promoting a comprehensive approach to the revitalization and strengthening of the Institute, which has led to the adoption of important institutional and political changes that are contributing to the strengthening of the Institute,
	1.	Welcomes the report of the Working Group on the Future Operation of the International Research and Training Institute for the Advancement of Women,1 in which the Working Group, inter alia, reaffirmed the mandate of the Institute in the field of gender equality and the advancement of women and stressed the need for it to be reformed and revitalized, as recommended in its previous report2 and endorsed by the General Assembly in its resolution 57/175;
	2.	Decides to continue monitoring the implementation of the measures recommended by the Working Group in its report,2 in close consultation with the Secretary-General;

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the First Committee (A/50/584)]


50/64.Amendment of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 46/28 of 6 December 1991, in which it noted the convening of the Amendment Conference of the States Parties to the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water from 7 to 18 January 1991, its resolution 48/69 of 16 December 1993, in which it noted the convening of a special meeting of the States parties to that Treaty on 10 August 1993, and its resolution 49/69 of 15 December 1994, in which it noted with satisfaction the commencement of multilateral negotiations for a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty in the Conference on Disarmament on 1 February 1994,

	Reiterating its conviction that a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is the highest-priority measure for the cessation of the nuclear-arms race and for the achievement of the objective of nuclear disarmament,

	Recalling the central role of the United Nations in the field of nuclear disarmament and in particular in the cessation of all nuclear-test explosions, as well as the persistent efforts of non-governmental organizations in the achievement of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty,

	Convinced that the Amendment Conference will facilitate the attainment of the objectives set forth in the Treaty and thus serve to strengthen it,


	Recalling its recommendation that arrangements be made to ensure that intensive efforts continue, under the auspices of the Amendment Conference, until a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty is achieved, and its call that all parties participate in, and contribute effectively to the success of, the Amendment Conference,

	1.	Urges all States that have not already done so to adhere to the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water 1/ at the earliest possible date;

	2.	Urges all States parties to the Treaty to contribute to the conclusion of a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty as soon as possible and no later than 1996 and to its expeditious entry into force;

	3.	Requests the President of the Amendment Conference to conduct consultations to those ends;

	4.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-first session the item entitled "Amendment of the Treaty Banning Nuclear Weapon Tests in the Atmosphere, in Outer Space and under Water".

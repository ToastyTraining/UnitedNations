	3.	Requests the Secretary-General, within existing resources, to ensure that the Security Council and its sanctions committees are able to carry out their work expeditiously, and to make appropriate arrangements in the relevant parts of the Secretariat, in order to carry out, in a coordinated way, the following functions:

	6.	Invites the organizations of the United Nations system, international financial institutions, other international organizations, regional organizations and Member States to continue to take into account and to address more specifically and directly, where appropriate, special economic problems of third States affected by sanctions imposed under Chapter VII of the Charter and, for this purpose, to consider ways and means for improving procedures for consultations in order to maintain a constructive dialogue with such States, including through regular and frequent meetings as well as, where appropriate, special meetings between the affected third States and the donor community, with the participation of United Nations agencies and other international organizations;

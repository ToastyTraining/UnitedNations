	Welcoming the general comment 1/ of the Human Rights Committee on article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 2/

	Recalling article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,

	Reaffirming that discrimination against human beings on the grounds of religion or belief constitutes an affront to human dignity and a disavowal of the principles of the Charter,

	Reaffirming the call of the World Conference on Human Rights for all Governments to take all appropriate measures in compliance with their international obligations and with due regard to their respective legal systems to counter intolerance and related violence based on religion or belief, including practices of discrimination against women and the desecration of religious sites, recognizing that every individual has the right to freedom of thought, conscience, expression and religion,

	Recalling Commission on Human Rights resolution 1992/17 of 21 February 1992 4/ in which Commission decided to extend for three years the mandate of the Special Rapporteur appointed to examine incidents and governmental actions in all parts of the world that are incompatible with the provisions of the Declaration and to recommend remedial measures, as appropriate, and recalling also Economic and Social Council decision 1992/226 of 20 July 1992,

	Calling upon all Governments to cooperate with the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights, Mr. Abdelfattah Amor, to enable him to carry out his mandate fully,

	Recognizing that it is desirable to enhance the promotional and public information activities of the United Nations in matters relating to freedom of religion or belief and that both Governments and non-governmental organizations have an important role to play in this domain,

	Emphasizing that non-governmental organizations and religious bodies and groups at every level have an important role to play in the promotion of tolerance and the protection of freedom of religion or belief,

	Conscious of the importance of education in ensuring tolerance of religion and belief,

	Welcoming the inclusion of events relating to tolerance and religious diversity among the activities to be undertaken during the United Nations Year for Tolerance, with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization as the lead organization,

	Alarmed that serious instances, including acts of violence, of intolerance and discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief occur in many parts of the world,

	Deeply concerned that, as reported by the Special Rapporteur, the rights violated on religious grounds include the right to life, the right to physical integrity and to liberty and security of person, the right to freedom of expression, the right not to be subjected to torture or other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the right not to be arbitrarily arrested or detained, 5/

	6.	Recognizes that legislation alone is not enough to prevent violations of human rights, including the right to freedom of religion or belief;

	7.	Emphasizes that, as underlined by the Human Rights Committee, restrictions on the freedom to manifest religion or belief are permitted only if limitations are prescribed by law, are necessary to protect public safety, order, health or morals, or the fundamental rights and freedoms of others, and are applied in a manner that does not vitiate the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion;

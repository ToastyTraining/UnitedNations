Declaration of the high-level meeting of the sixty-first session
of the General Assembly on the midterm comprehensive global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for
the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010
	We, Heads of State and Government and heads of delegations participating in the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on the midterm comprehensive global review of the implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010,2 held on 18 and 19 September 2006:
	1.	Recommit ourselves to meeting the special needs of the least developed countries by making progress towards the goals of poverty eradication, peace and development through the improvement of the quality of lives of people in the least developed countries and the strengthening of their abilities to build a better future for themselves and develop their countries, as committed to in the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010;
	2.	Reaffirm that the Programme of Action constitutes a fundamental framework for a strong global partnership whose goal is to accelerate sustained economic growth, sustainable development and poverty eradication in the least developed countries;
	3.	Also reaffirm that the primary responsibility for development in the least developed countries rests with those countries themselves, but that their efforts need to be given concrete and substantial international support from Governments and international organizations in a spirit of shared responsibility through genuine partnerships, including with civil society and the private sector;
	4.	Support the smooth transition strategy developed for the graduation of countries from the list of least developed countries and, in this regard, affirm the need for the international community to render necessary support to the graduation of the least developed countries with a view to averting the disruption of their development projects and programmes and allowing them to continue developing;
	5.	Stress that the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, can be effectively achieved in the least developed countries through, in particular, the timely fulfilment of the seven commitments of the Programme of Action;
	6.	Note that, while the Programme of Action has, since its adoption, registered some progress in its implementation, at the same time the overall socio-economic situation in the least developed countries continues to be precarious; 
	7.	Stress that, given current trends, many least developed countries are unlikely to achieve the goals and objectives set out in the Programme of Action;
	8.	Emphasize, however, that many least developed countries, with the support of their development partners, have, despite many difficulties, produced notable achievements through wide-ranging and far-reaching reforms;
	9.	Acknowledge the significant efforts by development partners in the implementation of the Programme of Action, also acknowledge that there is more to be done to implement the Programme of Action, in particular in the area of poverty eradication, and recognize that the situation in the least developed countries requires continued attention;
	10.	Recognize that it is important to achieve the goals and targets of the Programme of Action in a timely manner and, in this regard, welcome the elaboration of the Cotonou Strategy for the Further Implementation of the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-20103 as an initiative owned and led by least developed countries;
	11.	Welcome the measures taken by developed and developing countries, as well as by multilateral organizations, to promote South-South cooperation and call upon them to continue to enhance their resources and efforts for capacity-building and development in the least developed countries, including the sharing of best practices in the sustainable development of the least developed countries;
	12.	Call upon the international community and the United Nations system and its agencies to continue to assist in the implementation of the Programme of Action, taking into account the conclusions of the midterm comprehensive global review;
	13.	Invite the Economic and Social Council to continue to ensure the annual review of the implementation of the Programme of Action, taking into account the concrete and quantifiable achievements produced in the realization of the agreed objectives.

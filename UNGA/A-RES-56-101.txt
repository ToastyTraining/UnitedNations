	Welcoming the fact that, at the donor conference hosted jointly by the World Bank and the European Commission in Brussels on 29 June 2001, the programme for reform and development of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia received strong support and confirmed that meeting the basic needs of vulnerable groups within the refugee, displaced and resident populations remains a priority for humanitarian agencies,

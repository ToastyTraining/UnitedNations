	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming its resolutions 50/19 of 28 November 1995, 52/171 of 16 December 1997, 54/98 of 8 December 1999 and 56/102 of 14 December 2001,
	Reaffirming also its resolutions 46/182 of 19 December 1991, 47/168 of 22 December 1992, 48/57 of 14 December 1993, 49/139 A and B of 20 December 1994, 50/57 of 12 December 1995 and 51/194 of 17 December 1996 and Economic and Social Council resolutions 1995/56 of 28 July 1995 and 1996/33 of 25 July 1996,
	Emphasizing the need to address the strategic planning gap between relief and development activities in the context of humanitarian emergencies, taking into account the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1
	Recognizing that the international community, in addressing the growing magnitude and complexity of man-made and natural disasters and chronic situations characterized by hunger, malnutrition and poverty, must rely not only on the formulation of a well-coordinated global response within the framework of the United Nations but also on the promotion of a smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation, reconstruction and development,
	Recalling once again that prevention, preparedness and contingency planning for emergencies on a global level depend, for the most part, on the strengthening of local and national response capacities as well as on the availability of financial resources, both domestic and international,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General,2 prepared in pursuance of its resolution 56/102 on the participation of volunteers, "White Helmets", in the activities of the United Nations in the field of humanitarian relief, rehabilitation and technical cooperation for development;
	2.	Recognizes the value of domestic and regional actions aimed at making pre-identified, standby and trained national volunteer corps such as the White Helmets available to the United Nations system, through the United Nations Volunteers and other agencies, and in accordance with accepted United Nations procedures and practices, in order to provide specialized human and technical resources for emergency relief and rehabilitation;
	3.	Expresses its satisfaction for the progress of the White Helmets initiative as a singular voluntary international effort to provide the United Nations system with voluntary expertise to respond, in a quick and coordinated manner, to United Nations appeals concerning humanitarian relief, rehabilitation, reconstruction and development, while preserving the non-political, neutral and impartial character of humanitarian action;
	4.	Encourages Member States to identify their respective national focal points for the White Helmets in order to continue to provide the United Nations system with an accessible global network of rapid response facilities in case of humanitarian emergencies;
	5.	Recognizes with appreciation the progress made by the States members of the Common Market of the South and its associated partners in strengthening and broadening the regional role of the White Helmets initiative, and encourages Member States in other regional associations to make similar joint efforts;
	6.	Encourages operational partners of the United Nations system, in particular United Nations Volunteers and the United Nations Development Programme, to draw upon the voluntary expertise of the White Helmets, as appropriate, including in their response to chronic situations characterized by hunger, malnutrition and poverty;
	7.	Recognizes that the White Helmets initiative can play an important role in the promotion, diffusion and fulfilment of the decisions achieved in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 and invites Member States in a position to do so to consider means to ensure the integration of the White Helmets initiative into their programme activities and to make the commensurate financial resources available through the special financing window of the Special Voluntary Fund of the United Nations Volunteers, or in coordination with it;
	8.	Invites the Secretary-General, on the basis of the experience acquired, to consider further the potential use of White Helmets as a resource for preventing and mitigating the effects of post-conflict humanitarian emergencies and, in this context, to maintain adequate support for the White Helmets liaison functions, taking into account the ongoing reforms process;
	9.	Requests the Secretary-General to take into consideration the ten years that will have passed since the adoption of its resolution 49/139 B, the first resolution on the White Helmets initiative, and, in view of the success of coordinated actions carried out since then with, inter alia, the United Nations Children's Fund, the World Food Programme, the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat, the United Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Volunteers, to consider their impact and to analyse possible steps and modalities to enhance the integration of the White Helmets initiative within the work of the United Nations system, suggesting appropriate mechanisms and areas, and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its sixtieth session.

	Taking into account the need to strengthen the existing cooperation between the Regional Centre and the African Union, in particular its institutions in the fields of peace, security and disarmament, as well as with relevant United Nations bodies and programmes in Africa for greater effectiveness, and considering the focus of its resolution 63/310 of 14 September 2009 on cooperation between the United Nations and the African Union, and in particular the need to address the problems related to peace and disarmament, and the communiqué adopted by the Peace and Security Council of the African Union at its two-hundredth meeting, held in Addis Ababa on 21 August 2009, in which the Council welcomes the increased collaboration between the Regional Centre and the African Union and regional organizations in the areas of peace, security and disarmament,

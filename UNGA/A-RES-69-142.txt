[on the report of the Third Committee (A/69/480)]
69/142.	Realizing the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities towards 2015 and beyond


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling earlier operational frameworks, such as the World Programme of Action concerning Disabled Persons,1 which it adopted on 3 December 1982, and the Standard Rules on the Equalization of Opportunities for Persons with Disabilities,2 which it adopted on 20 December 1993, in which persons with disabilities are recognized as both development agents and beneficiaries in all aspects of development, 
	Reaffirming the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,3 which it adopted on 13 December 2006 and which entered into force on 3 May 2008, a landmark convention affirming the human rights and fundamental freedoms of persons with disabilities, recognizing that it is both a human rights and a development instrument, and taking note of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,4
	Recalling all of its previous resolutions on realizing the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals for persons with disabilities, as well as the relevant resolutions of the Human Rights Council and of the Economic and Social Council and its functional commissions,
	Recalling also its previous resolutions on the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, in which it recognized the collective responsibility of Governments to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality and equity at the global level, and in this sense stressing the duty of Member States to achieve the full application and implementation of the international normative framework on persons with disabilities and development, including by encouraging the ratification and implementation of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities,
	Recalling further the outcome document of the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals,5 the outcome document of the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development, entitled "The future we want",6 and the outcome document of the 2011 high-level plenary meeting of the Assembly on HIV and AIDS, entitled "Political Declaration on HIV and AIDS: Intensifying Our Efforts to Eliminate HIV and AIDS",7 which contain references to the rights, participation, well-being and perspectives of persons with disabilities in development efforts,
	Recognizing that persons with disabilities make up an estimated 15 per cent of the world's population, or 1 billion people, of whom an estimated 80 per cent live in developing countries, and acknowledging the value of their contribution to the general well-being, progress and diversity of society,
	Gravely concerned that persons with disabilities, in particular women, children, youth, indigenous peoples and older persons, continue to be subject to multiple and aggravated forms of discrimination and are still largely invisible in the implementation, monitoring and evaluation of the Millennium Development Goals and the internationally agreed development goals, and noting that, while progress has already been made by Governments, the international community and the United Nations system in mainstreaming disability, in particular the rights of persons with disabilities, as an integral part of the development agenda, major challenges remain,
	Underlining the need for urgent action by all stakeholders towards the adoption and implementation of more ambitious disability-inclusive national development strategies and efforts with disability-targeted actions, backed by increased international cooperation and support,
	Stressing the need for capacity development efforts aimed at empowering persons with disabilities and their representative organizations to ensure equal access to full and productive employment and decent work on an equal basis and without discrimination to persons with disabilities, including by promoting access to inclusive education systems, skills development, volunteering opportunities and vocational and entrepreneurial training in order to enable persons with disabilities to attain and maintain maximum independence,
	Concerned that persons with disabilities are disproportionately affected in disaster, emergency and conflict situations, as well as by poverty,
	Concerned also that the continuing lack of statistics and reliable data and information on the situation of persons with disabilities at the national, regional and global levels contributes to their exclusion in official statistics, presenting an obstacle to achieving development planning and implementation that is inclusive of persons with disabilities,
	Stressing the importance of collecting and analysing reliable data on persons with disabilities following existing guidelines on disability statistics,8 encouraging ongoing efforts to improve data collection in order to disaggregate data with regard to persons with disabilities by gender and age, and underlining the need for internationally comparable data to assess progress on development policies that are inclusive of persons with disabilities,

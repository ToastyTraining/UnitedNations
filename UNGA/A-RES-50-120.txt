	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

50/120.Triennial policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolutions 44/211 of 22 December 1989 and 47/199 of 22 December 1992, as well as other relevant resolutions,

	Reaffirming that operational activities for development within the United Nations system have a critical and unique role to play in enabling developing countries to continue to take a lead role in the management of their own development process,

	Bearing in mind that the effectiveness of operational activities should be measured by their impact on the sustained economic growth and sustainable development of developing countries,

	Stressing that national plans and priorities constitute the only viable frame of reference for the national programming of operational activities for development within the United Nations system, and that programmes should be based on such development plans and priorities, and should therefore be country-driven,

	Also stressing in that context the need to take into account the outcomes and commitments of relevant United Nations conferences, as well as the individual mandates and complementarities of the organizations and bodies of the United Nations development system, bearing in mind the need to avoid duplication,

	Further stressing that the fundamental characteristics of the operational activities of the United Nations system should be, inter alia, their universal, voluntary and grant nature, their neutrality and their multilateralism, as well as their ability to respond to the needs of developing countries in a flexible manner, and that the operational activities of the United Nations system are carried out for the benefit of the developing countries, at the request of those countries and in accordance with their own policies and priorities for development,


	Recognizing the urgent and specific needs of the low-income countries, in particular the least developed countries,

	Noting the progress that has been achieved in a number of areas in the implementation of its resolution 47/199, while stressing the need for individual organs, organizations and bodies of the United Nations system, as well as coordination mechanisms of the United Nations system, to continue to work towards the full and coordinated implementation of that resolution,

	Also recognizing that the United Nations development system should take into account the specific needs and requirements of the countries with economies in transition and other recipient countries,

	Recalling that the General Assembly is the highest intergovernmental mechanism for the formulation and appraisal of policy matters relating to the economic, social and related fields, in accordance with Chapter IX of the Charter of the United Nations, and that the functions and powers of the Economic and Social Council are provided for in Chapters IX and X of the Charter and are elaborated in relevant Assembly resolutions, including resolutions 45/264 of 13 May 1991 and 48/162 of 20 December 1993, in which the Assembly defined the relationship between the Assembly, the Council and the executive boards of the funds and programmes, in particular the Council function of overall guidance and coordination of the operational activities for development of the United Nations system,

	4.	Notes with regret that, although significant progress has already been made on the restructuring and rationalization of the governance and functioning of the United Nations development funds and programmes, there has  not been, as part of the overall reform process, any substantial increase in resources for operational activities for development on a predictable, continuous and assured basis, nor have the consultations on prospective new modalities for financing reached a conclusion;

	5.

	6.	Urges developed countries, in particular those countries whose overall performance is not commensurate with their capacity, taking into account established official development assistance targets, including targets established at the Second United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries 2/ and their current levels of contribution, to increase substantially their official development assistance, including contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations system;

	7.	Notes with appreciation the sustained contributions of many donors and recipient countries to the operational activities for development in a spirit of partnership;

	10.	Decides that intensified consultations and negotiations on prospective new specific modalities for financing operational activities for development on a predictable, continuous and assured basis, in accordance with paragraphs 31 to 34 of annex I to resolution 48/162 on the restructuring and revitalization of the United Nations in the economic and social fields, should lead to an agreed outcome in the framework of the review process of that resolution;

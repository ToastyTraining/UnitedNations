	[on the report of the Third Committee (A/51/619/Add.1)]


51/88.Commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling that, in adopting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights1 on 10 December 1948, it recognized the inherent dignity and equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family as the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,

	Considering that the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration provides an opportunity for the United Nations and its Member States to redouble their efforts to promote awareness and strengthened observance of the rights set out in the Declaration,

	Recognizing the Declaration as the source of inspiration and the basis of subsequent progress in the field of human rights,

	Concerned that international human rights standards are not fully and universally respected, that human rights continue to be violated in all parts of the world, and that people still suffer misery and are deprived of the full enjoyment of their civil, cultural, economic, political and social rights, and convinced of the necessity to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in all situations and to strengthen United Nations efforts in this regard,


	Recalling the significance and the message of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993,2 

	Recalling also its decision 48/416 of 10 December 1993, in which it decided to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-third session an item entitled "Fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights", 

	Having considered the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights,3 in particular section IX thereof entitled "1998:  Human Rights Year", in which proposals to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary were made, including the convening of a ceremonial meeting of the General Assembly, and welcoming the intention of the High Commissioner to facilitate cooperation between various initiatives aimed at the commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary,

	1.	Requests the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to coordinate the preparations for the fiftieth anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 bearing in mind the provisions set out in the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action2 for evaluation and follow-up;

	2.	Invites Governments to review and assess the progress that has been made in the field of human rights since the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, to identify obstacles and ways in which they can be overcome to achieve progress in this area, to undertake additional efforts and to develop programmes of education and information, with a view to disseminating the text of the Declaration and arriving at a better understanding of the universal message;

	3.	Invites the human rights treaty bodies to give appropriate attention, within their mandates and methods of work, to the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration and to reflect on their possible contribution to the preparations;

	4.	Endorses the intention of the relevant United Nations organs and agencies, in the light of the purposes set forth in the Declaration , to make an assessment of and to put forward pertinent conclusions on the state of implementation and impact of existing international human rights instruments;

	5.	Calls upon the relevant United Nations organs and agencies, in coordination with the High Commissioner, to mark the anniversary by intensifying their own contributions to United Nations system-wide efforts to promote and protect human rights;

	6.	Invites non-governmental organizations and national institutions to participate fully in the preparations for the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration, to intensify their campaign for greater understanding and better use of the Declaration and to communicate their observations and recommendations to the High Commissioner;


	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to include in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 1998-1999 appropriate activities to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration;

	8.	Decides to convene, during its fifty-third session, a one-day plenary meeting, on 10 December 1998, to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the Declaration;

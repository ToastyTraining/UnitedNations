	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 68/72 of 11 December 2013 and all its previous resolutions on assistance in mine clearance and on assistance in mine action, all adopted without a vote,
	Recalling also all relevant treaties and conventions1 and their review processes,
	Noting with appreciation the extent to which the tenth anniversary of the International Day for Mine Awareness and Assistance in Mine Action was commemorated worldwide on 4 April 2015,
	Reaffirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian and development problems caused by mines and explosive remnants of war,2 in affected countries, which have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of such countries, and negatively affect the delivery of humanitarian assistance,
	Bearing in mind the serious humanitarian threat that mines and explosive remnants of war, including cluster munitions, pose, in affected countries, to the safety, health and lives of local civilian populations, as well as of personnel participating in humanitarian, peacekeeping, rehabilitation and mine clearance programmes and operations,
	Deeply alarmed by the still very large, albeit decreasing, number of mines and areas of square kilometres contaminated by them, as well as the growing number of explosive remnants of war, as a result of armed conflicts, and therefore remaining convinced of the necessity and urgency of strengthening mine action efforts by the international community with a view to eliminating the threat and the humanitarian impact of landmines and explosive remnants of war to civilians as soon as possible,
	Recognizing the humanitarian threat posed by improvised explosive devices following conflict,
	Recognizing also that, in addition to the primary role of States, the United Nations plays a significant role in the field of assistance in mine action, in particular through the implementation of the Strategy of the United Nations on Mine Action 2013-2018 by members of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group on Mine Action,3 chaired by the United Nations Mine Action Service at working level, considering mine action to be an important and integrated component of United Nations humanitarian assistance and development activities, and noting the integration of mine action in numerous United Nations peacekeeping operations and special political missions mandated by the Security Council,
	Noting with appreciation the cooperation and coordination of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group on Mine Action with non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders through meetings of the Committee on Mine Action,4 and its active involvement in humanitarian coordination mechanisms, such as the Global Protection Cluster, and encouraging further enhancement of that cooperation,
	Recognizing the importance of the full involvement and equal opportunities for participation of both women and men in mine action programmes,
	Recognizing also the valuable mine action efforts of national, regional and international mine action practitioners, including United Nations personnel and peacekeepers, and also experts from relevant non-governmental organizations involved in mine action, enabling local communities and mine survivors to resume normal lives and reclaim their livelihoods by regaining access to previously contaminated lands,
	Noting with appreciation national, regional and subregional efforts, including the African Union Mine Action and Explosive Remnants of War Strategic Framework 2014-2017,
	Noting with satisfaction the growing inclusion of mine action in humanitarian appeals,
	Stressing the pressing humanitarian need that exists when non-State actors deploy mines, improvised explosive devices and other associated explosive devices,
	Noting the recommendations of the Joint Inspection Unit and the elaboration of the Strategy of the United Nations on Mine Action 2013-2018, including the creation of a monitoring and evaluation mechanism to implement the Strategy, as well as the updating of the United Nations victim assistance policy, and encouraging the members of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group on Mine Action to continue their work to improve the impact of the United Nations in the field of mine action,

	Recalling its resolutions 65/207 of 21 December 2010, 67/163 of 20 December 2012 and 69/168 of 18 December 2014 on the role of the Ombudsman, mediator and other national human rights institutions in the promotion and protection of human rights,

	2.	Recalls paragraph 1 of resolution 69/168, in which it regretted that no specific report on the implementation of resolution 67/163 had been prepared;
	3.	Regrets that, once again, the Secretariat did not provide a specific report on the implementation of General Assembly resolutions on the role of the Ombudsman, mediator and other national human rights institutions in the promotion and protection of human rights, despite the request in resolution 69/168, and that the notes by the Secretary-General4 referring to the reports submitted to the Human Rights Council did not fully correspond to the specific requests by the Assembly in resolutions 69/168 and 67/163;
	4.	Notes, in this regard, the functional and structural differences between national human rights institutions, on the one hand, and the Ombudsman and mediator institutions, on the other, and underlines in this regard that reports on the implementation of General Assembly resolutions on the role of the Ombudsman, mediator and other national human rights institutions should be stand-alone reports; 
	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its seventy-second session the report requested in resolution 69/168; 
	6.	Recalls its request in resolution 69/168 that the Secretary-General report in particular on the obstacles encountered by States in implementing the resolution, as well as on best practices in the work and functioning of ombudsman, mediator and other human rights institutions, and requests him to seek the views of States and other relevant stakeholders, in particular ombudsman, mediator and other national human rights institutions, as well as civil society, in this regard, and to formulate recommendations in his report on how to establish or strengthen such institutions.

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/50/827/Add.1)]


50/236.Financing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Recalling Security Council resolutions 186 (1964) of 4 March 1964, by which the Council established the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus, and 1032 (1995) of 19 December 1995, by which the Council further renewed the mandate of the Force until 30 June 1996,

	Recalling also its resolution 49/230 of 23 December 1994 on the financing of the Force,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Force that are not covered by voluntary contributions are expenses of the Organization to be borne by         Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling further its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,


	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly               resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force by certain Governments,

	Expressing its appreciation to all those Member States and observer States which have made voluntary contributions to the Special Account established for the financing of the Force for the period prior to              16 June 1993,

	Noting that voluntary contributions were insufficient to cover all of the costs of the Force, including those incurred by troop-contributing Governments prior to 16 June 1993, and regretting the absence of an adequate response to appeals for voluntary contributions, including that contained in the letter dated 17 May 1994 from the Secretary-General to all Member States, 3/ 

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus as at 21 May 1996, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 9,486,206 United States dollars, representing 14.5 per cent of the total assessed contributions from 16 June 1993 to the period ending 30 June 1996, notes that some 23 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peace-keeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Force in full and on time;

	5.	Endorses the recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/ and takes note of the observations therein and of the views expressed by Member States in the Fifth Committee; 

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Force is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

	7.	Approves, on an exceptional basis, the special arrangements for the Force with regard to the application of article IV of the financial regulations of the United Nations, whereby appropriations required in respect of obligations owed to Governments providing contingents and/or logistic support to the Force shall be retained beyond the period stipulated under financial regulations 4.3 and 4.4, as set out in the annex to the present resolution;

	8.	Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Peace-keeping Force in Cyprus an amount of 45,079,500 dollars gross (43,049,600 dollars net) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997, inclusive of an amount of 1,065,900 dollars for the support account for peace-keeping operations, taking into consideration the funding through voluntary contributions of the one-third share of the cost of the Force, equivalent to 14,349,867 dollars, from the Government of Cyprus and the annual pledge of 6.5 million dollars from the Government of Greece, subject to the decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the Force beyond 30 June 1996 and the mandate periods to be decided upon by the Council;

	9.	Decides also, taking into consideration the funding through voluntary contributions of the one-third share of the cost of the Force, equivalent to 14,349,867 dollars, from the Government of Cyprus and the annual pledge of 6.5 million dollars from the Government of Greece, as an ad hoc arrangement, to apportion an amount of 24,229,633 dollars gross                 (22,199,733 dollars net) for the period from 1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997 among Member States at a monthly rate of 2,019,136 dollars gross (1,849,978 dollars net), in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of             27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995 and 50/224 of           11 April 1996 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and 50/451 B of 23 December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the years 1996 and 1997, as set out in its resolution 49/19 B of 23 December 1994 and its decision 50/471 A of 23 December 1995, subject to the decision of the Security Council to extend the mandate of the Force beyond 30 June 1996 and the mandate periods to be decided upon by the Council;

	10.	Decides further that, in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955, there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 9 above, their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated staff assessment income of 2,029,900 dollars approved for the period from             1 July 1996 to 30 June 1997;

	11.	Decides to continue to maintain as separate the account established for the period prior to 16 June 1993 for the Force, invites Member States to make voluntary contributions to that account, and requests the Secretary-General to continue his efforts in appealing for voluntary contributions to the account;

	12.	Invites voluntary contributions to the Force in cash and in the form of services and supplies acceptable to the Secretary-General, to be administered, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedure established by the General Assembly in its resolutions 43/230 of 21 December 1988, 44/192 A of 21 December 1989 and 45/258 of 3 May 1991;

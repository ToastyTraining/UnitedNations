	7.

	9.	Notes with approval that, since the end of the cold war, the United States of America and the Russian Federation have halted the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons and have committed themselves to eliminating excess fissile material resulting from the dismantlement of weapons no longer needed for national security;
	10.	Welcomes, in this context, the implementation of the 1993 Agreement concerning the Disposition of Highly Enriched Uranium Extracted from Nuclear Weapons, signed by the Governments of the Russian Federation and the United States of America, under which more than 216 metric tons of excess Russian highly enriched uranium have been down-blended for use as power reactor fuel, and the fact that, under the Agreement, 30 metric tons of highly enriched uranium from dismantled nuclear weapons will be down-blended per year until a total of 500 metric tons has been processed;

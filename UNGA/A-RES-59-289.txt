Requests the Secretary-General to continue to consider outsourcing actively in accordance with the guidance and goals mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 3 of resolution 55/232 and to ensure that programme managers satisfy all of the following criteria in their assessment of whether or not an activity of the Organization can be fully, or even partially, outsourced:
	(a)	Cost-effectiveness and efficiency: this is considered to be the most basic criterion; unless it can be adequately demonstrated that an activity can be done significantly more economically and, at the very least, equally efficiently, by an external party, outsourcing may not be considered;
	(b)	Safety and security: activities that could compromise the safety and security of delegations, staff and visitors may not be considered for outsourcing;
	(c)	Maintaining the international character of the Organization: outsourcing may be considered for activities in which the international character of the Organization is not compromised;
	(d)	Maintaining the integrity of procedures and processes: outsourcing may not be considered if it will result in any breach of established procedures and processes.

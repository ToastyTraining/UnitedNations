[on the report of the Third Committee (A/68/456/Add.2)]
68/178.	Protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism
	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, 
	Reaffirming also the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 
	Reaffirming further the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action,2 
	Reaffirming the fundamental importance, including in response to terrorism and the fear of terrorism, of respecting all human rights and fundamental freedoms and the rule of law,
	Reaffirming also that States are under the obligation to protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms of all persons, 
	Reaffirming further that terrorism cannot and should not be associated with any religion, nationality, civilization or ethnic group, 
	Reiterating the important contribution of measures taken at all levels against terrorism, consistent with international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, to the functioning of democratic institutions and the maintenance of peace and security and thereby to the full enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as the need to continue this fight, including through strengthening international cooperation and the role of the United Nations in this respect,
	Reaffirming its unequivocal condemnation of all acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, wherever and by whomsoever committed, regardless of their motivation, as criminal and unjustifiable, and renewing its commitment to strengthen international cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism, 
	Deeply deploring the occurrence of violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the context of the fight against terrorism, as well as violations of international refugee and humanitarian law, 
	Noting with concern measures that can undermine human rights and the rule of law, such as the detention of persons suspected of acts of terrorism in the absence of a legal basis for detention and due process guarantees, the deprivation of liberty that amounts to placing a detained person outside the protection of the law, the trial of suspects without fundamental judicial guarantees, the illegal deprivation of liberty and transfer of individuals suspected of terrorist activities, and the return of suspects to countries without individual assessment of the risk of there being substantial grounds for believing that they would be in danger of subjection to torture, and limitations to effective scrutiny of counter-terrorism measures, 
	Stressing that all measures used in the fight against terrorism, including the profiling of individuals and the use of diplomatic assurances, memorandums of understanding and other transfer agreements or arrangements, must be in compliance with the obligations of States under international law, including international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, 
	Stressing also that a criminal justice system based on respect for human rights and the rule of law, including due process and fair trial guarantees, is one of the best means for effectively countering terrorism and ensuring accountability, 
	Recalling article 30 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and reaffirming that acts, methods and practices of terrorism in all its forms and manifestations are activities aimed at the destruction of human rights, fundamental freedoms and democracy, threatening the territorial integrity and security of States and destabilizing legitimately constituted Governments, and that the international community should take the necessary steps to enhance cooperation to prevent and combat terrorism,3 
	Recognizing that respect for all human rights, respect for democracy and respect for the rule of law are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, 
	Emphasizing the importance of properly interpreting and implementing the obligations of States with respect to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and of abiding strictly by the definition of torture contained in article 1 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment4 in the fight against terrorism,
	Recalling its resolution 67/99 of 14 December 2012, Human Rights Council resolution 19/19 of 23 March 20125 and other relevant resolutions and decisions as stated in the preamble to General Assembly resolution 65/221 of 21 December 2012, and welcoming the efforts of all relevant stakeholders to implement those resolutions,
	Recalling also its resolution 60/288 of 8 September 2006, by which it adopted the United Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, and its resolution 66/282 of 29 June 2012 on the review of the Strategy, reaffirming that the promotion and protection of human rights for all and the rule of law are essential to the fight against terrorism, recognizing that effective counter-terrorism measures and the protection of human rights are not conflicting goals but complementary and mutually reinforcing, and stressing the need to promote and protect the rights of victims of terrorism, 
	Recalling further Human Rights Council resolution 22/8 of 21 March 2013,6 by which the Council decided to extend the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, 
	Recalling its resolution 64/115 of 16 December 2009 and the annex thereto entitled "Introduction and implementation of sanctions imposed by the United Nations", in particular the provisions of the annex regarding listing and delisting procedures, 
	1.	Reaffirms that States must ensure that any measure taken to combat terrorism complies with their obligations under international law, in particular international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law; 
	2.	Deeply deplores the suffering caused by terrorism to the victims and their families, expresses its profound solidarity with them, and stresses the importance of providing them with assistance and other appropriate measures to protect, respect and promote their human rights;

	4.	Reaffirms that all counter-terrorism measures should be implemented in accordance with their obligations under international law, including international human rights, refugee and humanitarian law, thereby taking into full consideration the human rights of all, including persons belonging to national or ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, and in this regard must not be discriminatory on grounds such as race, colour, sex, language, religion or social origin; 
	5.	Also reaffirms the obligation of States, in accordance with article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,7 to respect certain rights as non-derogable in any circumstances, recalls, in regard to all other Covenant rights, that any measures derogating from the provisions of the Covenant must be in accordance with that article in all cases, underlines the exceptional and temporary nature of any such derogations,8 and in this regard calls upon States to raise awareness about the importance of these obligations among national authorities involved in combating terrorism;

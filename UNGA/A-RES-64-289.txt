Improving the funding system of operational activities for development of the United Nations system for enhanced system-wide coherence
General principles
	22.

	23.	Welcomes the growing number of countries making financial contributions to the operational activities of the United Nations development system, as well as the diversification of funding sources and mechanisms within the system, and also welcomes, in this regard, the significant growth in funds contributed to United Nations development operations, from 13 billion United States dollars in 2003 to 22 billion dollars in 2008, the highest level ever; 
	24.	Stresses that core resources, because of their untied nature, continue to be the bedrock of the operational activities for development of the United Nations system, notes with concern, in that regard, the long-term decline in the share of core contributions to the United Nations development system, which, since 2005, has levelled off at about 34 per cent, and recognizes the need for organizations to attain, on a continuous basis, an adequate balance between core and non-core resources, taking into account the unique mandate structure and programmes of individual entities, while noting that non-core resources represent an important supplement to the regular resource base of the United Nations development system to support operational activities for development;

	30.	Recognizes the potential positive impact of determining the level of "critical mass" of core funding for United Nations development agencies, and notes, in that regard, that the concept of critical mass may include the level of resources adequate to respond to the needs of the programme countries and to produce the results expected in strategic plans, including administrative, management and programme costs; 
	31.	Invites the governing bodies of the United Nations funds and programmes to initiate further discussion with a view to exploring the most appropriate definition of, and a process towards arriving at, a critical mass of core funding for each fund and programme, according to their individual mandates; 
	32.	Invites the governing bodies of the relevant specialized agencies, within the context of their 2012-2013 budgets, to consider exploring the most appropriate concept of and process for arriving at a critical mass of core funding, according to their individual mandates;

Urges the executive boards of the United Nations funds and programmes and the governing bodies of the specialized agencies to take measures to improve their governance and oversight of programme and project-specific non-core funding by including in their annual reports an assessment of how such funding is aligned with the strategic plans of the respective organizations; 
	37.	Requests the Secretary-General to include information on all existing multi-donor trust funds and thematic trust funds, including information on their mandates, performance and governance structures, in the annual report on financial statistics to the Economic and Social Council, with a view to further improving the participation of Member States in their governance; 
	38.	Requests United Nations agencies administering multi-donor trust funds to report on the administration of those funds to their respective governing bodies on an annual basis in order to ensure better complementarity between funds provided through multi-donor trust funds and other funding sources; 
	39.	Acknowledges the ongoing efforts being undertaken by the United Nations Development Group with a view to avoiding the subsidization of non-core resources by core resources, in that regard requests the United Nations funds and programmes, and urges the specialized agencies, to avoid using core/regular resources to cover costs related to the management of extrabudgetary funds and their programme activities, and urges Member States making non-core contributions to reduce transaction costs and streamline reporting requirements, where possible; 

Improving information to monitor funding trends
	40.	Takes note of the improved reporting on funding for operational activities of the United Nations development system, and requests that further improvements be made in order to more accurately reflect the diversity in non-core funding streams, such as multi-donor trust funds, including funds pooled at the global, regional and country levels; 
	41.	Requests, in this regard, that future reporting on funding for the United Nations development system more clearly distinguish between funding for development and funding for humanitarian activities, and better differentiate self-supporting contributions from other non-core funding flows; 
	42.	Requests the Secretary-General to report on the predictability of funding for the United Nations development system, including the impact of rapid growth in non-core contributions compared to core funding, significant exchange rate fluctuations and the limited use of multi-year pledges, in the annual report to the Economic and Social Council on the results achieved and measures and processes implemented in follow-up to resolution 62/208, to be considered by Member States in the context of the comprehensive policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system;

	45.	Encourages the United Nations funds and programmes to identify additional efficiency savings, including at their headquarters, through common strategies and common operations, for example in the fields of human resources management, information technology and administration, while ensuring that such common strategies and operations are consistent with relevant intergovernmentally agreed policies, including those related to the United Nations common system, and to take into account the ongoing reforms on administrative and budgetary matters, and recommends, in that regard, that they submit annual reports on progress to their respective governing bodies and, as appropriate, keep the General Assembly abreast of such progress through their respective processes for reporting to the Economic and Social Council;

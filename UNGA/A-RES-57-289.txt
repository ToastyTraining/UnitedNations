	Having further considered the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,7
	Recalling its resolutions 56/248 A of 24 December 2001 and 56/248 B of 27 March 2002 on the financing of the International Tribunal for Rwanda for the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 December 2003,

	2.	Notes with concern that the vacancy rate at the International Tribunal for Rwanda remains at unacceptably high levels and that, by the end of 2002, the posts of Chief of Prosecution and Deputy Prosecutor will have been vacant for more than two years and nineteen months, respectively, despite information indicating that there was an abundance of qualified candidates in the region and elsewhere, and requests the Registrar of the Tribunal to ensure that the aforementioned posts are filled without further delay and to report thereon to the General Assembly no later than at its fifty-eighth session;
	3.

Notes with concern that the posts approved by the General Assembly in its resolutions 56/248 A and B for on-site audit and investigative services in the International Tribunal for Rwanda have not been filled, and calls upon the Office of Internal Oversight Services to fill those positions without any further delay; 
	5.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the long-term financial obligations of the United Nations with regard to the enforcement of sentences,4 on the understanding that future budgetary requests on enforcement of sentences will be considered on a case-by-case basis, taking into account legal, administrative and financial justification provided in support of each request;9
	6.	Affirms that it would be appropriate for the United Nations to bear the immediate costs arising from providing prisoners serving sentences imposed by the International Tribunal for Rwanda with a regime of imprisonment that is consistent with those outlined in paragraph 17 of the report of the Secretary-General;4
	7.	Invites the Security Council to address uncertainties arising from issues identified in paragraphs 8, 42 and 43 of the report of the Secretary-General4 and to provide guidance on possible amendments to the statute of the International Tribunal for Rwanda;
	8.	Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session on these issues, including the consideration of the Security Council;
	9.	Also requests the Secretary-General, as an ad hoc and interim measure, to charge the costs related to the needs arising with regard to the enforcement of sentences within presently appropriated resources before the end of the biennium 2002-2003;
	10.	Further requests the Secretary-General, in full cooperation with the International Tribunal for Rwanda, to ensure that due consideration is given in all future budget proposals for the Tribunal to the provision of resources to facilitate the enforcement of sentences;
	11.	Requests the Secretary-General to ensure adequate oversight of prison facility upgrade projects and the subsequent maintenance of minimum international prison standards where those maintenance costs are borne by the United Nations;
	12.	Also requests the Secretary-General to continue to assess the accuracy of the cost estimates proposed in his report on the enforcement of sentences,4 to report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session, and to keep the cost estimates under periodic review; 
	13.	Urges the International Tribunal for Rwanda to continue to consult closely with the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in the development and implementation of its own completion strategy;
	14.	Requests the Secretary-General to prepare a comprehensive report on the progress made by the International Tribunal for Rwanda in reforming its legal aid system for consideration by the General Assembly at the main part of its fifty-eighth session;
	15.	Also requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-eighth session the proposed budget of the International Tribunal for Rwanda for the biennium 2004-2005, which should include the following elements:
	(a)	The budget should include detailed information as to how the resources requested for the biennium will support the development of a sound and realistic completion strategy and the status of implementation of Board of Auditors recommendations, where relevant, with regard to specific items of proposed expenditure;
	(b)	The budget requirements for the Registry, the Office of the Prosecutor and the non-judicial, administrative functions of the Chambers should be presented in a results-based format linking objectives and inputs to expected accomplishments to be measured by indicators of achievement;
	(c)	Revised arrangements for preventing overexpenditures by defence counsel and for managing, monitoring and controlling the expenses of the legal aid system of the International Tribunal for Rwanda should be included in support of proposals for defence costs, including a full definition and establishment of quantitative criteria for determining indigence and partial indigence based on, inter alia, the defendants' circumstances and ability to pay;
	(d)	Proposed allocations for costs for travel of investigators should be supported by those procedures implemented by the Registrar in order not to exceed requirements;
	(e)	The proposed post structure for the biennium 2004-2005 should reflect reductions and shifts in requirements within the International Tribunal for Rwanda owing to the expected completion of investigations by 2003 and, where appropriate, address any new requirements for established posts through redeployment;
	16.	Further requests the Secretary-General to consider the introduction, wherever feasible, in the International Tribunal for Rwanda of all measures undertaken in the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia that have proved effective with regard to controlling administrative costs, including maintaining efficient administrative and managerial functions; 
	17.	Approves the additional resources for the International Tribunal for Rwanda for 2003 as recommended by the Advisory Committee, except that the staffing complement shall be reduced by four posts, and requests the Secretary-General to report on the use of ad litem judges and their impact in the second performance report for the biennium 
2002-2003;
	18.	Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that optimum use is made of ad litem judges, following their introduction, to increase the number of court sessions and extend scheduled working hours;
	19.	Decides that the financing for the unassessed expenditures incurred in 2001, in the amount of 2,664,500 United States dollars gross (1,880,000 dollars net), shall be drawn from the unencumbered balance in the Special Account for the International Tribunal for Rwanda;10

	21.

the succession of States
	The General Assembly,
	Having examined the item entitled "Nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States",
	Recalling its resolution 54/112 of 9 December 1999, in which it decided to consider at its fifty-fifth session the draft articles on nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States prepared by the International Law Commission,
	Recalling also its resolution 55/153 of 12 December 2000, the annex to which contains the articles on nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States,
	Recalling further its resolutions 59/34 of 2 December 2004 and 63/118 of 11 December 2008, 
	Taking into consideration the comments and observations of Governments1 and the discussions held in the Sixth Committee at the fifty-ninth, sixty-third and sixty-sixth sessions of the General Assembly2 on the question of nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States, with a view, in particular, to preventing the occurrence of statelessness as a result of a succession of States, as well as on the advisability of elaborating a legal instrument on this question,
	Taking note, in this regard, of the efforts made at the regional level towards the elaboration of a legal instrument on the avoidance of statelessness in relation to State succession,
	1.	Reiterates its invitation to Governments to take into account, as appropriate, the provisions of the articles contained in the annex to resolution 55/153, in dealing with issues of nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States;
	2.	Once again encourages States to consider, as appropriate, at the regional or subregional levels, the elaboration of legal instruments regulating questions of nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States, with a view, in particular, to preventing the occurrence of statelessness as a result of a succession of States;
	3.	Emphasizes the value of the articles in providing guidance to the States dealing with issues of nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States, in particular concerning the avoidance of statelessness;
	4.	Decides that, upon the request of any State, it will revert to the question of nationality of natural persons in relation to the succession of States at an appropriate time, in the light of the development of State practice in these matters.

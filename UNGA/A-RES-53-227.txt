	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	53/227.  Financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon


    The General Assembly,

    Reaffirming its resolutions 51/233 of 13 June 1997 and 52/237 of 26 June 1998,

    Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon1 and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

    Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 425 (1978) of 19 March 1978, by which the Council established the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force, the latest of which was resolution 1223 (1999) of 28 January 1999,

    Recalling its resolution S-8/2 of 21 April 1978 on the financing of the Force and its subsequent resolutions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 52/237,


    Reaffirming that the costs of the Force are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

    Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force,

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

    Concerned that the Secretary-General continues to face difficulties in meeting the obligations of the Force on a current basis, including reimbursement to current and former troop-contributing States,

    Concerned also that the surplus balances in the Special Account for the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon have been used to meet expenses of the Force in order to compensate for the lack of income resulting from non-payment and late payment by Member States of their contributions,

    1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon as at 30 April 1999, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 119,646,994 United States dollars, representing 4 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Force to the period ending 30 June 1999, notes that some 12 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, particularly those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

    2.	Expresses its deep concern that Israel did not comply with General Assembly resolutions 51/233  and 52/237;

    3.	Stresses once again that Israel should strictly abide by General Assembly resolutions 51/233 and 52/237;

    4.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, which bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

    5.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;


    6.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Force in full and on time;

    7.	Takes note of the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;3

    8.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Force is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

    11.	Reiterates its request to the Secretary-General to take the necessary measures to ensure the full implementation of paragraph 8 of General Assembly resolution 51/233 and paragraph 5 of  resolution 52/237, stresses once again that Israel shall pay the amount of 1,284,633 dollars resulting from the incident at Qana on 18 April 1996, and requests the Secretary-General to report on this matter to the Assembly at its fifty-fourth session;

    12.	Takes note of the additional requirements of 57,600 dollars gross (844,000 dollars net) for the period from 1 July 1997 to 30 June 1998, which will be covered by the liquidation of obligations no longer required for that period;

    13.

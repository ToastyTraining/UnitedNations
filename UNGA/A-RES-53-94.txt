	The General Assembly,

	Considering the relevant resolutions of the Security Council, particularly resolution 637 (1989) of 27 July 1989, and its own resolutions, particularly resolution 43/24 of 15 November 1988, in which it requests the Secretary-General to continue his good offices and to afford the fullest possible support to the Central American Governments in their efforts to achieve the objectives of peace, reconciliation, democracy, development and justice established in the agreement on "Procedures for the establishment of a firm and lasting peace in Central America" of 7 August 1987,1

	Reaffirming its resolutions in which it recognizes and stresses the importance of international economic, financial and technical cooperation and assistance, both bilateral and multilateral, aimed at promoting economic and social development in the region with a view to furthering and supplementing the efforts of the Central American peoples and Governments to achieve peace and democratization, particularly resolution 50/58 B of 12 December 1995, concerning international assistance to and cooperation with the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America,2 as well as its resolution 53/1 C of 2 November 1998, concerning emergency assistance to Central America, owing to the destruction caused by hurricane Mitch,


	Emphasizing the importance of the development of the Central American Integration System, which has as its main objective the promotion of the integration process; the Alliance for the Sustainable Development of Central America as the integrated programme for national and regional development, which contains the commitments and priorities of the countries of the area for the promotion of sustainable development; the establishment of the subsystem and of the regional social policy; the model of democratic Central American security; and the implementation of other agreements adopted at the presidential summit meetings, which taken together constitute the global frame of reference for consolidating peace, freedom, democracy and development and the basis for the promotion of mutually advantageous relations between Central America and the international community,

	Welcoming the visit of the Secretary-General to Guatemala in support of the process of consolidating peace, democracy and development in the Central American region, in particular, in that country,

	Recognizing the progress made in the fulfilment of the commitments contained in the Guatemala Peace Agreements, implementation of which is being verified by the United Nations Verification Mission in Guatemala, including those relating to the demobilization and reintegration of former combatants into civilian life, the treatment of returnees, the establishment of special commissions, the reduction of the army, the promotion and protection of human rights and progress in respect of constitutional reforms,

	Noting with gratification the efforts of the people and the Government of El Salvador to implement the peace accords fully,

	Recognizing with satisfaction the role played by the peacekeeping operations and observer and monitoring missions of the United Nations, which carried out successfully their mandate in Central America pursuant to the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the General Assembly, respectively,

	Welcoming the changes and progress made by the Central American people, whose efforts have brought about, inter alia, constitutional reforms, the strengthening of civil society, the creation of new political forms, the holding of free and pluralistic elections, the creation of mechanisms for the protection and promotion of human rights, freedom of expression, the strengthening of democratic institutions and of the rule of law, judicial reform processes and the adoption of a fairer development model providing greater opportunities for the Central American peoples,

67/36.	Effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium
	The General Assembly,
	Guided by the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the rules of international humanitarian law,
	Recalling its resolutions 62/30 of 5 December 2007, 63/54 of 2 December 2008 and 65/55 of 8 December 2010, 
	Determined to promote multilateralism as an essential means to carry forward negotiations on arms regulation and disarmament,
	Taking note of the opinions expressed by Member States and relevant international organizations on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium, as reflected in the reports submitted by the Secretary-General pursuant to resolutions 62/30, 63/54 and 65/55,1 
	Recognizing the importance of implementing, as appropriate, the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Health Organization to mitigate potential hazards to human beings and the environment from the contamination of territories with depleted uranium residues, 
	Considering that studies conducted so far by relevant international organizations have not provided a detailed enough account of the magnitude of the potential long-term effects on human beings and the environment of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium, 
	Recalling that the United Nations Environment Programme, in its report to the Secretary-General on the subject,2 affirms that major scientific uncertainties persist regarding the long-term environmental impacts of depleted uranium, particularly with respect to long-term groundwater contamination, and calls for a precautionary approach to the use of depleted uranium, 
	Convinced that, as humankind becomes more aware of the need to take immediate measures to protect the environment, any event that could jeopardize such efforts requires urgent attention to implement the required measures, 
	Taking into consideration the potential harmful effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium on human health and the environment, 
	1.	Expresses its appreciation to the Member States and international organizations that submitted their views to the Secretary-General pursuant to resolution 65/55 and previous resolutions on the subject;
	2.	Invites Member States and relevant international organizations, particularly those that have not yet done so, to communicate to the Secretary-General their views on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium;
	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to request relevant international organizations to update and complete, as appropriate, their studies and research on the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium on human health and the environment;
	4.	Encourages Member States, particularly the affected States, as necessary, to facilitate the studies and research referred to in paragraph 3 above;
	5.	Also encourages Member States to follow closely the development of the studies and research referred to in paragraph 3 above;
	6.	Invites Member States that have used armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium in armed conflicts to provide the relevant authorities of affected States, upon request, with information, as detailed as possible, about the location of the areas of use and the amounts used, with the objective of facilitating the assessment of such areas;
	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit an updated report on the subject to the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, reflecting the information submitted by Member States and relevant international organizations, including the information submitted pursuant to paragraphs 2 and 3 above;
	8.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-ninth session, under the item entitled "General and complete disarmament", the sub-item entitled "Effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium".

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 26 January 2007
[without reference to a Main Committee (A/61/L.53 and Add.1)]
61/255.  Holocaust denial


	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming its resolution 60/7 of 1 November 2005,
	Recalling that resolution 60/7 observes that remembrance of the Holocaust is critical to prevent further acts of genocide,
	Recalling also that, for this reason, resolution 60/7 rejects efforts to deny the Holocaust which, by ignoring the historical fact of those terrible events, increase the risk they will be repeated,
	Noting that all people and States have a vital stake in a world free of genocide,
	Welcoming the establishment by the Secretary-General of a programme of outreach on the subject of "the Holocaust and the United Nations", and also welcoming the inclusion by Member States within their educational programmes of measures to confront attempts to deny or minimize the importance of the Holocaust,
	Noting that 27 January has been designated by the United Nations as the annual International Day of Commemoration in memory of the victims of the Holocaust,
	1.	Condemns without any reservation any denial of the Holocaust;
	2.	Urges all Member States unreservedly to reject any denial of the Holocaust as a historical event, either in full or in part, or any activities to this end.

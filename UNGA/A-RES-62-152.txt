	Recalling further Human Rights Council resolutions 5/1 and 5/2 of 18 June 2007,2
	Noting with deep concern that in many countries persons and organizations engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms are frequently facing threats, harassment and insecurity as a result of those activities, including through restrictions on freedom of association or expression or the right to peaceful assembly, or abuse of civil or criminal proceedings,
	Gravely concerned that, in some instances, national security and counter-terrorism legislation and other measures have been misused to target human rights defenders or have hindered their work and safety in a manner contrary to international law,
	Gravely concerned also by the continuing high level of human rights violations committed against persons engaged in promoting and defending human rights and fundamental freedoms around the world and by the fact that in many countries impunity for threats, attacks and acts of intimidation against human rights defenders persists and that this has a negative impact on their work and safety,
	Concerned by the considerable number of communications received by the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on the situation of human rights defenders that, together with the reports submitted by some of the special procedure mechanisms, indicates the serious nature of the risks faced by human rights defenders, including women human rights defenders,

	Recognizing the substantial role that human rights defenders can play in supporting efforts to strengthen peace and development, through dialogue, openness, participation and justice, including by monitoring, reporting on and contributing to the promotion and protection of human rights,
	Recalling that, in accordance with article 4 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,3 certain rights are recognized as non-derogable in any circumstances and that any measures derogating from other provisions of the Covenant must be in accordance with that article in all cases, and underlining the exceptional and temporary nature of any such derogations, as stated in General Comment No. 29 on states of emergency adopted by the Human Rights Committee on 24 July 2001,4

Urges States to ensure that any measures to combat terrorism and preserve national security comply with their obligations under international law, in particular under international human rights law, and do not hinder the work and safety of individuals, groups and organs of society engaged in promoting and defending human rights;

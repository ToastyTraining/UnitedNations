 				 Civil Service Commission
    

    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the report of the International Civil Service Commission for the year 19981 and other related reports,2

    Reaffirming its commitment to a single, unified United Nations common system as the cornerstone for the regulation and coordination of the conditions of service of the United Nations common system,

    Convinced that the common system constitutes the best instrument to secure staff of the highest standards of efficiency, competence and integrity for the international civil service, as stipulated under the Charter of the United Nations,

    Reaffirming the central role of the Commission in the regulation and coordination of the conditions of service of the United Nations common system,

    2.	Reaffirms the need to continue to ensure the competitiveness of the conditions of service of the common system;

    3.	Notes the decision of the Commission to suspend total compensation comparisons until 2001, and requests the Commission to undertake the next study in 2001 to identify the highest paid national civil service, using the methodology endorsed by the General Assembly in a manner consistent with the United States/United Nations total compensation comparison;


	B. Evolution of the margin

    Recalling section I.B of its resolution 52/216 of 22 December 1997 and the standing mandate from the General Assembly, in which the Commission is requested to continue its review of the relationship between the net remuneration of the United Nations staff in the Professional and higher categories in New York and that of the comparator civil service (the United States federal civil service) employees in comparable positions in Washington, D.C. (referred to as "the margin"),

    Recalling also section IX, paragraph 3, of its resolution 46/191 A of 20 December 1991, in which it requested the Commission to include in its work a review of the differences between the United Nations and the United States net remuneration at individual grade levels,

    Recalling further section II.B, paragraph 3, of its resolution 48/224 of 23 December 1993, wherein it considered that the Commission should address the imbalance in the United Nations/United States remuneration ratios in the context of overall margin considerations,

    1.	Notes the intention of the Commission, in the light of its previous recommendations with respect to the above request, to explore possible solutions to the problems of imbalances in the United Nations/United States net remuneration ratios at individual grade levels;

    2.	Also notes that the margin between net remuneration of United Nations staff in grades P-1 to D-2 in New York and that of officials in comparable positions in the United States federal civil service for 1998 is 114.8;
            

	C. Base/floor salary scale


    Recalling section I.H of its resolution 44/198, by which it established a floor net salary level for staff in the Professional and higher categories by reference to the corresponding base net salary levels of officials in comparable positions serving at the base city of the comparator civil service (the United States federal civil service),

    Approves, with effect from 1 March 1999, the revised base scale of gross and net salaries for staff in the Professional and higher categories, contained in annex I to the present resolution, and the consequential amendment to the Staff Regulations of the United Nations, as reflected in annex II to the present resolution;

    Recalling section III, paragraph 1, of its resolution 51/216, by which it approved, with effect from 1 January 1997, a revised staff assessment scale recommended by the Commission for determining the pensionable remuneration of all categories of staff, and recalling that, in paragraph 2 of the same section, it requested the Commission to report on the impact of the differences in national and local tax rates at the seven headquarters duty stations on the gross pension benefits of locally recruited staff in the General Service and related categories at those duty stations in comparison with the compensation for such taxes provided by the common staff assessment rates,

    1.	Takes note of the conclusion of the Commission, as set out in paragraph 215 of its report,1 that the current common staff assessment scale should continue to apply and should again be reviewed in 2000;

    2.	Takes note also of the conclusions of the Commission based on the comparison of the impact of the common staff assessment rates and local taxes on the levels of pensionable remuneration and consequent pensions of the General Service and related categories of staff, as reported in paragraph 224 of its report;

    3.	Endorses the view of the Commission, as set out in paragraph 225 of its report, that the local practice approach to determining pensionable remuneration of the General Service and other locally recruited categories of staff should not be pursued further;

	F.  Dependency allowances

    Recalling section II.F of its resolution 47/216 of 23 December 1992, in which it noted that the Commission would review the level of dependency allowances every two years,


    Taking note that the review of dependency allowances by the Commission reflected relevant changes in tax abatement and social legislation at the seven headquarters duty stations since 1996, as contained in paragraph 119 of its report,1

    2.	Takes note of the updated list of hard-currency duty stations for which the allowances are specified in local currency, as  contained in annex III to the present resolution;

    3.	Notes that dependency allowances payable to eligible common system staff should be reduced by the amount of any direct payments received from a Government in respect of dependants;

    4.	Requests the Commission to undertake in 2000 an examination of the methodology, rationale and scope of the allowances;


	G.  Post adjustment matters

    Requests the Commission, in the context of its preparation of the next round of place-to-place surveys, as referred to in paragraph 141 of its report,1 to conduct a comprehensive review of the post adjustment system as a whole with a view to its reform, with the assistance of independent experts, if necessary, keeping in mind the need for cohesion within the common system, and to ensure that the post adjustment at each duty station, with particular emphasis on headquarters duty stations, is fully representative of the cost of living of all staff members in the Professional and higher categories working at each duty station, and to report thereon to the General Assembly no later than at its fifty-fifth session;

    1.	Notes that a number of essential elements still remain to be resolved, including  the rationale for recommending a change to the existing scheme, the degree to which such a change will continue to serve as an incentive for multilingualism in the organizations, the basis for determining the incentive amounts for both categories, and transitional measures;

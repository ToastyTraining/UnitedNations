Emphasizes that contingency provisions approved for construction projects serve to provide necessary safeguards against unforeseen cost overruns during project implementation, and in this regard requests the Secretary-General to ensure that, in the future, any cost overruns are first met from compensatory reductions identified elsewhere through efficiencies in order to obviate to the extent possible the need for drawdown from contingency provisions;

	12.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to update Member States regularly, through the Office of Central Support Services of the Department of Management of the Secretariat, on the progress of the construction project;

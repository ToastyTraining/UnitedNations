    The General Assembly,

    Reaffirming its resolution 41/213 of 19 December 1986 in which it, inter alia, requested the Secretary-General to submit in off-budget years an outline of the proposed programme budget for the following biennium,

    Reaffirming also section VI of its resolution 45/248 B of 21 December 1990,

    Reaffirming further rule 153 of its rules of procedure,

    Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the proposed programme budget outline for the biennium 2000-2001,1 the related recommendations of the Committee for Programme and Coordination2 and the recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,3


    Having considered also the report of the Secretary-General on issues related to additional expenditures, including those relating to the maintenance of peace and security, inflation and currency fluctuation,4 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,5

    1.	Takes note of the report of the Committee for Programme and Coordination6 and the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;3

    2.	Reaffirms that the proposed programme budget outline shall contain an indication of the following:

    (a)	Preliminary estimate of resources to accommodate the proposed programme of activities during the biennium;

    (b)	Priorities reflecting general trends of a broad sectoral nature;

    (c)	Real growth, positive or negative, compared with the previous budget;

    (d)	The size of the contingency fund expressed as a percentage of the overall level of resources;

    3.	Also reaffirms that the outline should provide a greater level of predictability of resources required for the following biennium, promote greater involvement of Member States in the budgetary process and thereby facilitate the broadest possible agreement on the programme budget;

    4.	Notes that the budget outline is a preliminary estimate of resources;

    5.	Reaffirms that the budget proposals of the Secretary-General should reflect resource levels commensurate with  mandates for their full, efficient and effective implementation;

    6.	Emphasizes the need for Member States to provide adequate resources for the full implementation of all mandated programmes and activities;

    7.	Decides that the anticipated reduction of 19.8 million United States dollars related to compensating economies should not be included in the proposed programme budget outline for the biennium 2000-2001;

    8.	Recognizes, furthermore, that efforts to achieve efficient utilization of resources constitute an ongoing process and should not adversely affect the implementation of mandated programmes and activities;


    9.	Endorses the proposal of the Secretary-General in his report on additional expenditures,7 and the related recommendations of the Advisory Committee in its report,8 that provision should be made in the budget outline for expenditures for special political missions related to peace and security expected to be extended or approved in the course of the biennium;

    10.	Decides that the preliminary estimate of resources for the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 should therefore include a provision for special political missions, in the amount of 86.2 million dollars at revised 1998-1999 rates, which should be reflected in the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001, and that additional requirements shall continue to be treated in accordance with the provisions of General Assembly resolution 41/213;

    11.	Invites the Secretary-General to prepare his proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 on the basis of a total preliminary estimate of 2,545 million dollars at revised 1998-1999 rates;

    12.	Decides that the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2000-2001 shall contain provisions for recosting on the basis of the existing methodology;

    13.	Reiterates that the priorities for the biennium 2000-2001 as determined by the General Assembly in its resolution 51/219 of 18 December 1996 are the following:

    15.	Decides that the contingency fund shall be set at the level of 0.75 per cent of the preliminary estimate, namely at 19.1 million dollars, and that this amount is in addition to the overall level of the preliminary estimate and is to be used in accordance with the procedures for the use and operation of the contingency fund.

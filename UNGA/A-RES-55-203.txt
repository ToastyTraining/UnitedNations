	Taking into account all other relevant resolutions adopted by the General Assembly, including resolution 54/225 of 22 December 1999,
	Reaffirming the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,5 and emphasizing the fundamental character of the Convention,
	Conscious that the problems of ocean space are closely interrelated and that they need to be considered as a whole,
	Recalling the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region, signed at Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, on 24 March 1983, which contains the definition of the wider Caribbean region of which the Caribbean Sea is part,6
	Welcoming the adoption, on 16 October 1999 in Aruba, of the Protocol Concerning Pollution from Land-based Sources and Activities7 to the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region,
	Welcoming also the entry into force, on 18 June 2000, of the Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife7 to the Convention for the Protection and Development of the Marine Environment of the Wider Caribbean Region,
	Recalling the relevant work done by the International Maritime Organization,
	Considering that the Caribbean Sea area includes a large number of States, countries and territories, most of which are developing countries and small island developing States that are ecologically fragile, structurally weak and economically vulnerable and are also affected, inter alia, by their limited capacity, narrow resource base, need for financial resources, high levels of poverty and the resulting social problems and the challenges and opportunities of globalization and trade liberalization,
	Recognizing that the Caribbean Sea has a unique biodiversity and highly fragile ecosystem,
	Emphasizing that the Caribbean countries have a high degree of vulnerability occasioned by climate change and variability, associated phenomena, such as the rise in sea level, the El Niño/Southern Oscillation phenomenon and the increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters caused by hurricanes, floods and droughts, and that they are also subject to natural disasters, such as those caused by volcanoes, tsunamis and earthquakes,
	Welcoming the establishment of the working group on the El Niño/La Niña phenomenon within the framework of the Inter-Agency Task Force for Disaster Reduction,
	Bearing in mind the heavy reliance of most of the Caribbean economies on their coastal areas, as well as on the marine environment in general, to achieve their sustainable development needs and goals,
	Recognizing the Caribbean Environment Outlook process currently being undertaken by the United Nations Environment Programme, and welcoming the support being provided by the Caribbean Environment Programme of the United Nations Environment Programme towards its implementation,
	Acknowledging that the intensive use of the Caribbean Sea for maritime transport, as well as the considerable number and interlocking character of the maritime areas under national jurisdiction where Caribbean countries exercise their rights and duties under international law, present a challenge for the effective management of the resources,
	Noting the problem of marine pollution caused, inter alia, by land-based sources and the continuing threat of pollution from ship-generated waste and sewage as well as from the accidental release of hazardous and noxious substances in the Caribbean Sea area,
	Taking note of resolution GC(44)/RES/17 of 22 September 2000 of the General Conference of the International Atomic Energy Agency on safety of transport of radioactive materials,8
	Mindful of the diversity and dynamic interaction and competition among socio-economic activities for the use of the coastal areas and the marine environment and their resources,
	Mindful also of the efforts of the Caribbean countries to address in a more holistic manner the sectoral issues relating to the management of the Caribbean Sea area and, in so doing, to promote an integrated management approach to the Caribbean Sea area in the context of sustainable development, through a regional cooperative effort among Caribbean countries,
	Noting the efforts of the Caribbean countries, within the framework of the Association of Caribbean States, to develop further support for their concept of the Caribbean Sea as an area of special importance, in the context of sustainable development and in conformity with the relevant provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea,5
	Cognizant of the importance of the Caribbean Sea to present and future generations and its importance to the heritage, the continuing economic well-being and sustenance of people living in the area, and the urgent need for the countries of the region to take appropriate steps for its preservation and protection, with the support of the international community,

	3.	Also encourages the continued efforts of the Caribbean countries to develop further an integrated management approach to the Caribbean Sea area in the context of sustainable development and, in this regard, to continue to develop regional cooperation in the management of their ocean affairs in the context of sustainable development, to address such issues as land-based pollution, pollution from ships and the diversity and dynamic interaction of, and competition among, socio-economic activities for the use of the coastal areas and the marine environment and their resources;
	4.	Calls upon the United Nations system and the international community to assist Caribbean countries and their regional organizations in their efforts to ensure the protection of the Caribbean Sea from degradation as a result of pollution from ships, in particular through the illegal release of oil and other harmful substances, from illegal dumping or accidental release of hazardous waste, including radioactive materials, nuclear waste and dangerous chemicals, in violation of relevant international rules and standards, as well as pollution from land-based activities;
	5.	Calls upon all relevant States to take the necessary steps to bring into force, and to support the implementation of, the Protocol Concerning Pollution from Land-based Sources and Activities,7 in order to protect the marine environment of the Caribbean Sea from land-based pollution and degradation;

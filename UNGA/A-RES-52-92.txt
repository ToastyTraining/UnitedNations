	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolutions 50/148 of 21 December 1995 and 51/64 of 12 December 1996,

	Gravely concerned that, despite continued increased efforts by States and relevant international organizations, there is a global expansion of illicit demand for, production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, including synthetic and designer drugs, which threatens the health, safety and well-being of millions of persons, in particular young people, in all countries, as well as the political and socio-economic systems and the stability, national security and sovereignty of an increasing number of States,

 	Deeply alarmed by the growing and spreading violence and economic power of criminal organizations and terrorist groups engaged in drug trafficking activities and other criminal activities, such as money laundering and illicit traffic of arms and precursors and essential chemicals, and by the increasing transnational links between them, and recognizing that enhanced international cooperation and effective strategies are essential to achieve results against all forms of transnational criminal activities,

	Convinced of the growing need for closer coordination and cooperation among States in combating drug-related crimes, such as terrorism, illicit arms trade and money laundering, and bearing in mind the role that could be played by both the United Nations and regional organizations in this respect,

	Fully aware that States, the relevant organizations of the United Nations system and multilateral development banks need to accord a higher priority and political determination to dealing with this scourge, which undermines development, economic and political stability and democratic institutions, and the combat against which entails increasing economic costs for Governments and the irreparable loss of human lives,


	Reaffirming and stressing the need for increased efforts to implement the comprehensive framework for international cooperation in drug control provided by the existing drug control conventions, the Declaration of the International Conference on Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking1 and the Comprehensive Multidisciplinary Outline of Future Activities in Drug Abuse Control,2 the Political Declaration and Global Programme of Action3 adopted by the General Assembly at its seventeenth special session, which was devoted to the question of international cooperation against illicit production, supply, demand, trafficking and distribution of narcotic and psychotropic substances, the declaration adopted by the World Ministerial Summit to Reduce the Demand for Drugs and to Combat the Cocaine Threat,4 the United Nations System-wide Action Plan on Drug Abuse Control,5 the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan against Organized Transnational Crime adopted by the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Transnational Crime, held at Naples, Italy, from 21 to 23 November 1994,6 and other relevant international standards,

	Underlining the importance of a balanced approach in efforts undertaken by Member States in the fight against illicit demand, production and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances,

	Recognizing the efforts of countries that produce narcotic drugs for scientific, medicinal and therapeutic uses to prevent the diversion of such substances to illicit markets and to maintain production at a level consistent with licit demand in line with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961,7

	Convinced that civil society, including non-governmental organizations, can make an effective contribution to addressing the illicit drug problem,

	Recognizing that the use of the Internet poses new opportunities and challenges to international cooperation in combating drug abuse and illicit production and trafficking,

	Acknowledging that there are links, under certain circumstances, between poverty and the increase in the illicit production of and trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and that the promotion of the economic development of countries affected by the illicit drug trade requires appropriate measures, including strengthened international cooperation in support of alternative and sustainable development activities in the affected areas of those countries, which have as their objectives the reduction and elimination of illicit drug production,

	Stressing that respect for human rights is and must be an essential component of measures taken to address the drug problem,

	Emphasizing the need for a continued analysis of transit routes used by drug traffickers, which are constantly changing and expanding to include a growing number of countries and regions in all parts of the world,

	Underlining the role of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs as the principal United Nations policy-making body on drug control issues, the leadership role and commendable work of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme as the main focus for concerted international action and the important role of the International Narcotics Control Board as an independent monitoring authority, as set out in the international drug control treaties,

	Recalling the important and central role of relevant United Nations bodies in evaluating the implementation by States parties of their obligations under the United Nations drug control treaties, as set out in those treaties,

	Also recalling that in resolution 51/64, section IV, it decided to convene, for three days in June 1998, a special session of the General Assembly to consider the fight against the illicit production, sale, demand, traffic and distribution of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances and related activities and to propose strategies, methods, practical activities and specific measures to strengthen international cooperation in addressing the problem of illicit drugs, and convinced that the special session will make a significant contribution to the effectiveness of the United Nations and its Member States in the fight against this global problem,

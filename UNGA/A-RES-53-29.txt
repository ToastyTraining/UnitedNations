53/29.Financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone


	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Observer Mission in Sierra Leone1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

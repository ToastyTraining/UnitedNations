Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 9 December 2003
[on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/58/513)]
58/76.	Model Legislative Provisions on Privately Financed Infrastructure Projects of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law


	The General Assembly,
	Bearing in mind the role of public-private partnerships to improve the provision and sound management of infrastructure and public services in the interest of sustainable economic and social development,
	Recognizing the need to provide an enabling environment that both encourages private investment in infrastructure and takes into account the public interest concerns of the country,
	Emphasizing the importance of efficient and transparent procedures for the award of privately financed infrastructure projects,
	Stressing the desirability of facilitating project implementation by rules that enhance transparency, fairness and long-term sustainability and remove undesirable restrictions on private sector participation in infrastructure development and operation,
	Recalling the valuable guidance that the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law has provided to Member States towards the establishment of a favourable legislative framework for private participation in infrastructure development through the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Privately Financed Infrastructure Projects,1
	Believing that the Model Legislative Provisions on Privately Financed Infrastructure Projects of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law will be of further assistance to States, in particular developing countries, in promoting good governance and establishing an appropriate legislative framework for such projects,
	1.	Expresses its appreciation to the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law for the completion and adoption of the Model Legislative Provisions on Privately Financed Infrastructure Projects, the text of which is contained in annex I to the report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on its thirty-sixth session;2
	2.	Requests the Secretary-General to publish the Model Legislative Provisions and to make all efforts to ensure that the Model Legislative Provisions along with the UNCITRAL Legislative Guide on Privately Financed Infrastructure Projects1 become generally known and available;
	3.	Also requests the Secretary-General, subject to availability of resources, to consolidate in due course the text of the Model Legislative Provisions and the Legislative Guide into one single publication and, in doing so, to retain the legislative recommendations contained in the Legislative Guide as a basis of the development of the Model Legislative Provisions;
	4.	Recommends that all States give due consideration to the Model Legislative Provisions and the Legislative Guide when revising or adopting legislation related to private participation in the development and operation of public infrastructure.

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the First Committee (A/49/691)]


49/67.Scientific and technological developments and their impact on international security


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling that at its tenth special session, the first special session devoted to disarmament, it unanimously stressed the importance of both qualitative and quantitative measures in the process of disarmament,

	Recognizing that scientific and technological developments can have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needs to be maintained and encouraged,

	Noting with concern the potential in technological advances for application to military purposes, which could lead to more sophisticated weapons and new weapons systems,

	Stressing the interests of the international community in the subject and the need to follow closely the scientific and technological developments that may have a negative impact on the security environment and on the process of arms limitation and disarmament, and to channel scientific and technological developments for beneficial purposes,


94-60189

	Emphasizing that the proposal contained in its resolution 43/77 A of 7 December 1988 is without prejudice to research and development efforts being undertaken for peaceful purposes,

	Expressing regret that the Disarmament Commission was unable to develop guidelines from its deliberations under its agenda item entitled "The role of science and technology in the context of international security, disarmament and other related fields", 1/


	Convinced that genuine non-proliferation can only be achieved when transfer of high technology with military applications is in accordance with universally accepted, multilaterally negotiated, non-discriminatory legal treaties,

	1.	Welcomes the report of the Secretary-General entitled "Scientific and technological developments and their impact on international security" 2/ submitted in pursuance of General Assembly resolution 48/66 of 16 December 1993;

	2.	Fully agrees with the assessment that the application of new technologies for a qualitative improvement of weapons systems was seen as detracting from the efforts to reduce and eliminate the existing arsenals; 3/

	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to follow scientific and technological developments and to make a relevant assessment in keeping with the criteria presented to the General Assembly at its forty-fifth session 4/ and to submit a report to the Assembly at its fiftieth session;

	4.	Also requests the Secretary-General to develop a database of concerned research institutions and experts with a view to promoting transparency and international cooperation in the applications of the scientific and technological developments for pursuing disarmament objectives such as disposal of weapons, conversion and verification, among others;

	5.	Invites all Member States to communicate to the Secretary-General their views and assessments;

	6.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fiftieth session the item entitled "Scientific and technological developments and their impact on international security".

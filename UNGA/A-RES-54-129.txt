    The General Assembly,

    Recalling its resolution 53/111 of 9 December 1998, in which it decided to establish an open-ended intergovernmental ad hoc committee for the purpose of elaborating a comprehensive international convention against transnational organized crime and of discussing the elaboration, as appropriate, of international instruments addressing trafficking in women and children, combating the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, and illegal trafficking in and transporting of migrants, including by sea,

    Bearing in mind that in resolution 54/126 of 17 December 1999 it requested the Ad Hoc Committee on the Elaboration of a Convention against Transnational Organized Crime to schedule sufficient time, subject to the availability of funds from the regular budget or from extrabudgetary resources, for the negotiation of the draft protocols addressing trafficking in persons, especially women and children, the illicit manufacturing of and trafficking in firearms, their parts and components and ammunition, and smuggling of migrants by land, air and sea, in order to enhance the possibility of their completion at the same time as the draft Convention,

    Acknowledging the progress made thus far by the Ad Hoc Committee towards the goal of completing negotiations in 2000,


    Mindful that substantive negotiations on the Convention and the protocols thereto continue in Vienna in accordance with General Assembly resolutions 40/243 of 18 December 1985  and 53/111 and 53/114 of 9 December 1998,

    Recalling that in its resolution 54/126 it decided that the Ad Hoc Committee should submit the final text of the Convention and the protocols thereto to the General Assembly for early adoption prior to a high-level signing conference,

    Recalling also the Naples Political Declaration and Global Action Plan against Organized Transnational Crime, adopted by the World Ministerial Conference on Organized Transnational Crime, held in Naples, Italy, from 21 to 23 November 1994,1 in which the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice was requested to initiate the process of elaborating international instruments, such as a convention or conventions against organized transnational crime,

    Recognizing the initiating role and the contribution of the Government of Poland to the development of a draft convention against transnational organized crime,

    Recognizing also the historic and symbolic importance of associating the first international convention against transnational organized crime with the city of Palermo, Italy,

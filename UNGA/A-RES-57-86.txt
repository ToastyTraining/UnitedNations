Resolution adopted by the General Assembly
[on the report of the First Committee (A/57/510)]
57/86.	Compliance with arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation agreements


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 52/30 of 9 December 1997 and other relevant resolutions on the question,
	Recognizing the abiding concern of all Member States for maintaining respect for rights and obligations arising from treaties to which they are parties and other sources of international law,
	Convinced that observance by Member States of the Charter of the United Nations, treaties to which they are parties and other sources of international law is important for the strengthening of international security,
	Mindful of the fundamental importance of full implementation and strict observance of agreements and other agreed obligations on arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation by States parties if individual nations and the international community are to derive enhanced security from them,
	Stressing that any violation of such agreements and other agreed obligations by States parties not only adversely affects the security of States parties but can also create security risks for other States relying on the constraints and commitments stipulated in those agreements and other agreed obligations,
	Stressing also that any weakening of confidence in such agreements and other agreed obligations diminishes their contribution to global or regional security and undermines their credibility and effectiveness,
	Recognizing, in this context, that full compliance by States parties with all provisions of existing agreements and the resolving of compliance concerns effectively by means consistent with such agreements and international law can, inter alia, contribute to better relations among States and the strengthening of world peace and stability, 
	Believing that compliance with all provisions of arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation agreements by States parties is a matter of interest and concern to all members of the international community, and noting the role the United Nations has played and should continue to play in that regard,
	Welcoming the contribution to international peace and regional security that full compliance by States parties with verification provisions of arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation agreements provides,
	Also welcoming the universal recognition of the critical importance of the question of compliance with and verification of arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation agreements, and other agreed obligations,
	Recognizing, in the light of the threat of international terrorism, that it is especially important that States parties comply with arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation obligations and commitments,
	1.	Urges all States parties to arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation agreements to implement and comply with the entirety of all provisions of such agreements;
	2.	Calls upon all Member States to give serious consideration to the implications that non-compliance by States parties with any provisions of agreements in the fields of arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation has for international security and stability, as well as for the prospects for progress in those fields;
	3.	Calls upon Member States to support efforts aimed at the resolution of compliance questions by means consistent with such agreements and international law, with a view to encouraging strict observance by all States parties of the provisions of arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation agreements and maintaining or restoring the integrity of such agreements;
	4.	Welcomes the role that the United Nations has played and continues to play in restoring the integrity of, and fostering negotiations on, certain arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation agreements and in the removal of threats to peace;
	5.	Encourages efforts by all States parties to pursue additional areas of cooperation, as appropriate, that can increase confidence in compliance with existing arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation agreements and reduce the possibility of misinterpretation and misunderstanding;
	6.	Notes the contribution that effective verification procedures for arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation agreements frequently can make in enhancing confidence in the compliance with those agreements;
	7.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-ninth session an item entitled "Compliance with arms limitation and disarmament and non-proliferation agreements".

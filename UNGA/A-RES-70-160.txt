	Recalling further that no exceptional circumstance whatsoever may be invoked as a justification for enforced disappearance,
	Recalling that no one shall be held in secret detention,
	Deeply concerned, in particular, by the increase in enforced or involuntary disappearances in various regions of the world, including arrest, detention and abduction, when these are part of or amount to enforced disappearances, and by the growing number of reports concerning harassment, ill-treatment and intimidation of witnesses of disappearances or relatives of persons who have disappeared,
	Recalling that the Convention sets out the right of victims to know the truth regarding the circumstances of the enforced disappearance, the progress and results of the investigation and the fate of the disappeared person, and sets forth State party obligations to take appropriate measures in this regard,
	Recalling also that the Convention defines the victim of enforced disappearance as the disappeared person and any individual who has suffered harm as the direct result of an enforced disappearance,
	Acknowledging that the widespread or systematic practice of enforced disappearance is recognized in the Convention as a crime against humanity, as defined in applicable international law,
	Stressing the importance of the work of the Working Group on Enforced or Involuntary Disappearances,

	2.	Recognizes the importance of the Convention, the ratification and the implementation of which will be a significant contribution to ending impunity and to promoting and protecting all human rights for all;
	3.	Welcomes the fact that 95 States have signed the Convention and 51 have ratified or acceded to it, and calls upon States that have not yet done so to consider signing, ratifying or acceding to the Convention as a matter of priority, as well as to consider the option provided for in articles 31 and 32 of the Convention regarding the Committee on Enforced Disappearances;
	4.	Also welcomes the report of the Secretary-General;3
	5.	Requests the Secretary-General and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to increase their intensive efforts to assist States in becoming parties to the Convention, including by supporting the actions of States to ratify the Convention, providing technical and capacity-building assistance to States and civil society and raising awareness about the Convention, with a view to achieving universal adherence;
	6.

	10.	Takes note with interest of all the general comments of the Working Group, including the most recent comments on children5 and women6 affected by enforced disappearances, and recognizes in this regard that enforced disappearances have special consequences for women and vulnerable groups, especially children, as they most often bear the serious economic hardships that usually accompany such disappearances and, when subjected to enforced disappearances themselves, may become particularly vulnerable to sexual and other forms of violence;

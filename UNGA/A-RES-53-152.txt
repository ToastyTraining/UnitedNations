    The General Assembly,

    Guided by the purposes and principles set forth in the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,1 the International Covenants on Human Rights2 and the other relevant international human rights instruments, 

    Recalling Commission on Human Rights resolutions 1993/91 of 10 March 19933 and 1997/71 of 16 April 1997,4 on the question of human rights and bioethics,

    Recalling also that, in accordance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world,


    Aware of the rapid development of the life sciences and of ethical concerns raised by certain of their applications with regard to the dignity of the human race and the rights and freedoms of the individual,

    Seeking to promote scientific and technical progress in the fields of biology and genetics in a manner respectful of fundamental rights and for the benefit of all,

    Emphasizing, in this regard, the importance of international cooperation in order to ensure that mankind as a whole benefits from the life sciences, while seeking to prevent them from being used for any purpose other than the good of mankind,

    Recalling the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights5 and the accompanying resolution on its implementation,6 both adopted on 11 November 1997 by the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization at its twenty-ninth session,

    Recognizing the importance of the process of follow-up to the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights within the framework of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,

    Convinced of the need to develop a life-sciences ethic at the national and international levels,

    Endorses the Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights adopted by the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on 11 November 1997.

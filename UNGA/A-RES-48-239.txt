	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Operation in Somalia II 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 751 (1992) of 24 April 1992, by which the Council established the United Nations Operation in Somalia, and Council resolution 886 (1993) of 18 November 1993, by which the Council extended the mandate of the United Nations Operation in Somalia II until 31 May 1994,

	Bearing in mind also Security Council resolution 897 (1994) of 4 February 1994, by which the Council authorized the gradual reduction of the Operation in Somalia II to a force level of up to 22,000, and necessary support elements, such force level to be reviewed at the next renewal of the mandate,

	Recalling its decision 48/471 A of 23 December 1993 on the financing of the Operation in Somalia II,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Operation in Somalia II are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

__________

	1/	A/48/850 and Corr.1.

	2/	A/48/899.

	Recalling its previous decision regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Operation in Somalia II, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Operation in Somalia II with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Operation in Somalia II as at 22 March 1994, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 153,104,873 United States dollars;

	2.	Expresses concern about the deteriorating financial situation with regard to peace-keeping activities due to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments, particularly Member States in arrears;

	3.	Expresses deep concern about the adverse effect that the deteriorating financial situation has on reimbursement to troop contributors, placing an additional burden on these countries and putting at risk the continuing supply of troops to the Operation in Somalia II and, consequently, the effective implementation of its mandate;

	4.	Reaffirms its resolution 48/227 of 23 December 1993 and stresses the need for the Secretariat to submit budget documents in time in order to allow for a proper and thorough review and approval by the General Assembly of the budgets before their implementation;

	5.	Notes with satisfaction an improvement in the compliance by the Secretariat with certain resolutions of the General Assembly with regard to  the form of budget documents concerning peace-keeping operations;

	6.	Reaffirms the importance of the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions as an advisory body to the General Assembly in the budget process;

	7.	Reiterates its decision 48/487 of 24 March 1994, in which it requested the Board of Auditors to conduct a special audit of all aspects of procurement for peace-keeping operations and observer missions;

	8.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee, 2/ subject to the provisions of the present resolution;

	9.	Takes note, in the context of paragraphs 39 to 41 of the report of the Advisory Committee, of the additional information provided by the Secretariat regarding the essential nature and long-term cost-effectiveness of the provisions made for logistical services;

	10.	Recommends that the Secretariat actively pursue all available means to deliver such services at more economical rates;

	11.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Operation in Somalia II is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy and, in particular, to implement fully economy, financial and efficiency measures to be approved during the resumed forty-eighth session but no later than 1 May 1994, and to report on the implementation of such measures in the context of the performance report relevant to the period;

	12.	Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Operation in Somalia II promptly and in full;

	13.	Affirms that the non-payment and late payment of assessed contributions in full and on time and the fact that the General Assembly has unfortunately been led to consider and approve budgets for peace-keeping operations without adequate documentation have damaged and continue to damage the ability of peace-keeping operations to implement their activities effectively;

	14.	Requests the Secretary-General to explore all possibilities in order to ensure prompt reimbursement to troop-contributing countries;

	15.	Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Operation in Somalia II, in accordance with the recommendations contained in paragraph 52 of the report of the Advisory Committee, a total amount of 639,399,300 dollars gross (634,214,900 dollars net) for the period from 1 November 1993 to 31 May 1994;

	16.

	19.	Requests the Secretary-General, in view of the amounts of the unencumbered balances which arise in some peace-keeping operations, to study the feasibility of a possible retention of the shares of Member States in the unencumbered balances of peace-keeping operations until the Member States meet all outstanding obligations in respect of the period concerned, and to report to the General Assembly in the context of agenda item 138, no later than 31 May 1994;

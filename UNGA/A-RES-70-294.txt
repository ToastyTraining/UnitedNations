Annex
Political Declaration of the Comprehensive High-level Midterm Review of the Implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020
1.	We, the Heads of State and Government and High Representatives participating in the Comprehensive High-level Midterm Review of the Implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2011-2020, are gathered here in Antalya, Turkey, from 27 to 29 May 2016 to undertake a comprehensive review of the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action,2 to share best practices and lessons learned and identify obstacles and constraints encountered and actions and initiatives needed to overcome them, as well as new challenges and emerging issues, to reaffirm the global commitment to address the special needs of the least developed countries made in Istanbul, Turkey, and to further strengthen the global partnership for development for the least developed countries in all priority areas of the Istanbul Programme of Action in order to ensure the timely, effective and full implementation of the Programme of Action during the remainder of the decade, in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,3 the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development,4 which is an integral part of the 2030 Agenda, supports and complements it and helps to contextualize its means of implementation targets with concrete policies and actions, the Paris Agreement,5 adopted by parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,6 and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030.7 
2.	We recognize the Comprehensive High-level Midterm Review as an opportunity to highlight the concrete measures, initiatives, partnerships and actions that various stakeholders have undertaken to date to support the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action and to launch other concrete measures, initiatives and partnerships, individually or collectively, that have the potential to further progress the implementation of the Programme of Action, building on the momentum of recent and relevant United Nations meetings, agendas and conferences and the decisions adopted therein. 
3.	We recognize that over the past few decades the world has witnessed remarkable socioeconomic progress, with most of the Millennium Development Goals and targets achieved globally. However, not all countries have fully shared in this global progress. Performances among the least developed countries were mixed. The majority of the least developed countries, which constitute the poorest and most vulnerable group of countries, were not able to achieve most of the Millennium Development Goals. Nevertheless, many of the least developed countries have adopted stronger policies, strengthened governance and achieved substantial gains in reducing the prevalence of extreme poverty and improved health and education outcomes. Progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and other internationally agreed development goals was slowest in the least developed countries in conflict and post-conflict situations; those countries require context-specific approaches, including targeted national policies and international support. 
4.	We recognize that, despite the many challenges and constraints, the least developed countries represent an enormous human and natural resource potential for world economic growth, welfare, prosperity and food and energy security. Therefore, a strengthened global partnership that effectively addresses the special needs of the least developed countries, including children, young people and women, will contribute to the cause of peace, prosperity, poverty eradication and sustainable development for all. 
5.	We reaffirm our commitment to the full, effective and timely implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action. We also reaffirm our commitment to the full and timely implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and our support for mainstreaming it into the national development policies and programmes of the least developed countries. We also reaffirm our determination to mobilize the means required to implement this Agenda through a revitalized global partnership for sustainable development, in a spirit of global solidarity, focused in particular on the eradication of poverty and promotion of inclusive growth and the implementation of social protection systems, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable.

I.	State of progress and lessons learned in the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action
6.	We note that many of the least developed countries have made considerable progress in achieving positive and sustainable development outcomes, in spite of significant challenges and constraints. For many of them, growth performance and prospects have been good on a sustained basis. Most of the least developed countries have significantly increased domestic resource mobilization and use for sustainable development. National ownership and leadership at the country level is essential for sustained progress in all priority areas of the Istanbul Programme of Action. 
7.	We are concerned that, in the context of the overall slowdown in the international economy, the least developed countries as a group are experiencing a slowdown of their economies, with growth rates falling from 5.1 per cent in 2014 to an estimated 4.5 per cent in 2015,8 which is significantly lower than the growth rate achieved during 2001-2010 and falls far short of the Sustainable Development Goal target of at least 7 per cent gross domestic product (GDP) growth per annum in the near term, and those that are highly dependent on commodity exports have seen a pronounced decline in their export earnings and GDP growth.
8.	We recognize that many of the least developed countries continue to face multiple structural challenges and constraints, including narrow production and export bases, stagnant trade and investment flows, diminishing productivity growth, weak land and natural resource governance, and widespread poverty, hunger and malnutrition. These long-standing challenges are compounded by new and emerging challenges, such as climate change, increased incidences of natural disasters and public health emergencies, conflicts, declining commodity prices and rising capital outflows. Without a structural transformation that tackles institutional and capacity constraints, the least developed countries will remain vulnerable to various economic, social and environmental shocks. 
9.	Continued robust external support, including through official development assistance (ODA), is necessary to complement domestic resources and national policies and programmes to effectively assist each of the least developed countries in addressing these important issues. We recognize the important contribution of the existing preferences extended to the least developed countries. 
10.	We recognize that swift action in areas related to productive capacity, infrastructure and energy, agriculture, food security and nutrition and rural development, economy, trade and investment, good governance at all levels, human development, gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls, financing for development, science, technology and innovation, migration and remittances, and resilience-building are necessary to realize the Istanbul Programme of Action and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development promise of leaving no one behind. 

General objectives, goals and targets 
11.	We recognize that, while the least developed countries have made significant efforts towards achieving the objectives, goals and targets of the Istanbul Programme of Action, a lot still remains to be done by them and their development partners. There is a need to foster progress across all sectors. We reaffirm our commitment to give special attention to the least developed countries in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. 

Graduation 
12.	We congratulate those countries that have graduated from least developed country status and welcome the fact that many of the least developed countries are meeting the criteria for graduation and many others have expressed their aspirations to graduate. We note with concern that, since the least developed country category was established in 1971, only four countries have officially graduated. Based on current trends, concerted and revitalized efforts will be required to enable half of the least developed countries to meet the criteria for graduation by 2020, as foreseen in the Istanbul Programme of Action. Particular attention should be given to the smooth transition of countries graduating from least developed country status, consistent with their transition strategy, taking into account each country's particular development situation. 

Productive capacity 
13.	We recognize that increasing productive capacity leads to inclusive economic growth and social development and is vital to the achievement of sustainable development and for building resilience. During the past five years, limited progress was achieved in production diversification and value addition as well as in the effective participation of the least developed countries in regional and global value chains, which are critical for those countries in reversing their marginalization, building productive capacities, accelerating structural transformation and generating full and productive employment and decent work for all with quick impact on poverty eradication. This situation requires strategic policy interventions at the subnational, national, regional and international levels, as well as at the sectoral level. In this regard, regional cooperation and integration can play a catalytic role. 

Infrastructure and energy 
14.	We stress that the development of sustainable and resilient physical infrastructure, the promotion of sustainable industrialization and fostering innovation are important prerequisites for sustained economic growth and sustainable development. A significant amount of investment and technology development is essential, including through public-private partnerships, innovative financing and regional integration, supported by appropriate and transparent national policies, practices, institutions and regulations that foster a strong investment climate. Enhanced financial and technical support by development partners for infrastructure development and management in the least developed countries, as well as continued support for those countries' efforts to strengthen the underlying investment climate, promote science, technology and innovation and facilitate the transfer of relevant skills, knowledge and technology for the development of infrastructure under mutually agreed terms, also remain crucial for infrastructure development in the least developed countries. 
15.	We emphasize that the acute energy gap faced by the least developed countries is a severe constraint on their structural transformation. Access to energy is often not provided because of lack of finance, technology, infrastructure for the generation and supply of energy, appropriate regulation and economic and technical skills. Skill development and improvement of the capacity of local enterprise to deliver good-quality products and services on an economically sustainable basis are also important to establish inclusive energy systems that also reach rural areas and the poorest part of the population. Addressing these issues will be crucial in providing access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. Such access is a key development enabler and multiplier, which can foster private sector development, strengthen productive capacity-building, expand trade and promote access to better social services and food security. Ensuring technological progress is also key to finding lasting solutions to both economic and environmental challenges, such as providing productive employment and decent work for all and promoting energy efficiency. 

Agriculture, food security and nutrition and rural development 
16.	We acknowledge that progress in the development of the agricultural sector and related industries, which employs more than half of the population in most of the least developed countries, is critical for sustainable development. 
17.	We recognize that low agricultural productivity and the availability and affordability of safe food remain major challenges in many of the least developed countries. Some 210 million people in the least developed countries, predominantly in rural areas, do not have access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food. Moreover, the least developed countries are urbanizing rapidly, and the proportion of urban residents who experience hunger and malnutrition is growing. The agriculture sector in the least developed countries continues to be affected by structural factors such as insufficient public and private investment in physical infrastructure and in research and agricultural extension services, limited access to markets, lack of secure land tenure, particularly for smallholder farmers and women, limited capacity-building, slow progress in regulatory and policy reforms and in scientific and technological development, lack of access to financial services, including insurance, poor investment climate, inadequate support to enhance the situation of women in rural areas, trade restrictions and distortions in world agricultural markets, and public stockholding in a manner that adversely affects food security, as well as periodic economic shocks such as price fluctuations. We note that less than 7 per cent of total ODA going to the least developed countries is allocated to agriculture. Furthermore, agriculture development has been suffering from the adverse impacts of climate change and extreme weather events, less predictable weather patterns, soil degradation, salinity intrusion, sea-level rise and coastal erosion, declining water availability and degrading water quality due to the increasing frequency of droughts and floods, and soil and water contamination. We reaffirm our commitment to work together to address these challenges in the least developed countries. We also note that integrated water resource management and intersectoral approaches among water, food and energy to increase synergies and manage trade-offs are essential. 

Economy, trade and investment 
18.	We are concerned that the growth rates of the least developed countries have fallen since 2011, and we emphasize the importance of reversing this trend. As identified in the Istanbul Programme of Action, trade and investment are major drivers of economic growth, employment generation and structural transformation. The challenge is also one of fostering inclusive growth, including through the empowerment of all women and girls and achieving gender equality, while promoting sustainable development, as the pace of reduction of poverty has not been commensurate with the economic growth rate. 
19.	We note some improvement in market access for products of the least developed countries in some developing countries during the past five years. We express our concern that the least developed countries' exports remained highly concentrated in a few primary products vulnerable to commodity price volatility and to exogenous economic and environmental shocks. The share of the least developed countries in world exports remained stagnant, standing in 2014 at 1.1 per cent and dropping to 0.97 per cent in 2015, a level that is far behind the objective of doubling their share of global exports by 2020, mentioned in the Istanbul Programme of Action. We acknowledge that a universal, rules-based, open, non-discriminatory and equitable multilateral trading system is key to promoting export diversification, trade and economic growth. 
20.	We are concerned that the share of the least developed countries in global foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows remains virtually unchanged from 2013 at 1.9 per cent and that FDI in the least developed countries remains concentrated in a small number of mineral-rich economies. We stress that economic diversification and a positive enabling environment for investments at all levels, as well as stronger and more focused policies and measures by the least developed countries, home countries of FDI, international organizations and other stakeholders, can substantially increase FDI flows to the least developed countries in the coming years. 
21.	We recognize that full and productive employment and decent work for all remains a central objective of macroeconomic and fiscal policies so that the benefits of growth reach all people, especially the poor, with a focus on mutually supportive strategies that lead to the rapid expansion of productive employment in the least developed countries and optimize the contribution of women and young people to economic growth and poverty reduction. 

Good governance at all levels and human development 
22.	We recognize that the promotion and protection of human rights, good governance, transparency, democratic participation, the rule of law at the national and international levels, human development, gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls are essential to achieving peace, prosperity and sustainable development in the least developed countries. Since the adoption of the Istanbul Programme of Action, the least developed countries have made some progress in these areas, yet considerable efforts are still needed. Several of the least developed countries have joined the Open Government Partnership, and we welcome their commitments to making their Governments more open, accountable and responsive to citizens. Forty-two of the least developed countries have become parties to the United Nations Convention against Corruption.9 Substantial progress towards achieving education for all at the primary level has been made, including gender parity for one third of the least developed countries. Nearly 20 per cent of all parliamentarians in the least developed countries are women. We also recognize that the achievement of full human potential and of sustainable development is not possible if women and girls continue to be denied the full realization of their human rights and opportunities. 
23.	We recognize that qualified and skilled human resources can make important contributions to sustainable development in the least developed countries. While much progress has been made towards achieving education for all at the primary and secondary levels, much more remains to be done to ensure that the over 24 million children of primary school age not in school and the over 22 million out-of-school adolescents of lower secondary school age in the least developed countries have access to quality education. Strengthened efforts by the least developed countries and their development partners are also needed to ensure that education is of good quality and that it provides all learners with the skills needed to access employment and decent work. 
24.	We note that greater efforts are also needed to better engage and empower young people. They need opportunities to learn, work and participate in decision-making processes and to contribute to building inclusive and peaceful societies that are free from violence. Particular efforts are needed to ensure that all young people, including girls, enjoy access to lifelong learning opportunities and equal access to quality education at all levels: early childhood, primary, secondary and tertiary education, as well as technical and vocational training. In this regard, we note with concern the lack of progress in closing gender gaps in access to, retention in and completion of secondary education. 

Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls 
25.	We recognize that further efforts are needed to remove the barriers that women and girls face regarding gender-based violence, access to safe learning environments, quality education, criminal justice systems, health-care services, including sexual and reproductive health, safe drinking water and sanitation and equal rights with men to economic opportunities such as employment, decent work, equal pay for equal work or work of equal value, entrepreneurship, participation in trade, access to and ownership of productive resources, including land and other forms of property, credit, inheritance, natural resources and appropriate new technology. Women and girls are also more vulnerable to climate change impacts. We must work to strengthen our attention to the full and effective participation of women and girls in decision-making at all levels as well as the elimination of discrimination, all forms of violence and harmful practices against women and girls, including child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation. 
26.	We reaffirm that achieving gender equality, empowering all women and girls, and the full realization of the human rights of all people are essential to achieving sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development. We reiterate the need for gender mainstreaming, including targeted actions and investments in the formulation and implementation of all financial, economic, environmental and social policies. 

Financing for development 
27.	We recognize that significant additional domestic public resources, including at the subnational level, supplemented by international assistance as appropriate, will be critical to realizing sustainable development and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda acknowledge the centrality of domestic resource mobilization underscored by the principle of national ownership and the important contribution of private investment, including FDI, for the achievement of sustainable development. While the least developed countries have made considerable efforts to mobilize domestic resources and attract private investment, further progress is needed. 
28.	We note that, as a result of cooperation between the United Nations, the Group of 20, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, there has been international progress in identifying and addressing the base erosion and profit shifting challenges for developing countries and ensuring that all countries, including the least developed countries, can take advantage of increases in tax transparency and exchange of information, such as by implementing the new international standard of automatic exchange of information. 
29.	We are also concerned by the impact that illicit financial flows have in draining resources away from the least developed countries. Illicit financial flows have an adverse impact on domestic resource mobilization and on the sustainability of public finances. The activities that underlie illicit financial flows, such as corruption, embezzlement, fraud, tax evasion, safe havens that create incentives for transfer of stolen assets abroad, money-laundering and illegal exploitation of natural resources, are also detrimental to development. We emphasize the importance of working together, including through increased international cooperation to stem corruption and identify, freeze and recover stolen assets and return them to their countries of origin, in a manner consistent with the United Nations Convention against Corruption. 
30.	We recognize that international public finance plays an important role in complementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically. For the least developed countries as a group, ODA remains the largest source of external financing. The decline in ODA going to the least developed countries during the past years was a worrisome trend, and the level of 0.09 per cent of gross national income (GNI) attained in 2014 remained below the relevant 
0.15-0.20 per cent target to which many developed countries have committed. In that context, we note the 4 per cent real-term increase in bilateral ODA to the least developed countries in 2015 and the projection that the proportion of ODA to those countries will continue to rise in 2016-2019, suggesting that developed countries are reversing the decline in ODA to the least developed countries in line with the commitment by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development at its high-level meeting in 2014 to reverse the declining trend of ODA to the least developed countries. We note with concern that FDI to those countries has remained constant as a share of global FDI and concentrated in a few countries and sectors. We also note the growing importance of remittances. 
31.	We welcome the recent decision by the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund to increase access to its concessional resources by 50 per cent for the poorest and most vulnerable countries. 
32.	We acknowledge the debt distress and sustainability challenges faced by some of the least developed countries. We recognize that the long-term sustainability of debt of those countries depends on, inter alia, economic growth, the mobilization of domestic and international resources, the export prospects of debtor countries, sustainable debt management, sound macroeconomic policies that also support job creation, sound public financial management at all levels, transparent and effective regulatory frameworks and overcoming structural development problems. 

Science, technology and innovation 
33.	We recognize that the Istanbul Programme of Action recommends that the least developed countries and development partners make concerted efforts to build science, technology and innovation capacity so that those countries can find and harness innovative solutions to sustainable development challenges and promote endogenous capacity for research and development to address the structural impediments to achieving sustainable development that those countries face. Despite the importance of science, technology and innovation for promoting positive development outcomes, the least developed countries have not made significant progress in this field since the adoption of the Programme of Action. We are concerned that fewer than 7 per cent of households in the least developed countries have access to the Internet, that many of the least developed countries lack affordable access to information and communications technologies and that, for the majority of the poor, the promise of science, technology and innovation remains unfulfilled, and we emphasize the need to effectively harness technology to bridge the digital divide. In this regard, we stress the growing importance of science, technology and innovation for promoting positive development outcomes, including in the least developed countries. 

Resilience-building 
34.	We are deeply concerned that, owing to significant capacity constraints, the least developed countries are disproportionately affected by the adverse impacts of climate change, including persistent drought and extreme weather events, sea-level rise, coastal erosion, salinity intrusion, glacier lake outburst floods, ocean acidification, and the rise in frequency as well as impacts of natural and man-made disasters, which further threaten food security and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development. We are deeply worried that an increase in global temperature, sea-level rise, ocean acidification and other climate change impacts can seriously affect coastal areas and low-lying coastal least developed countries. We are concerned that women and girls are often disproportionately affected by the impact of climate change and other environmental issues. 
35.	We note that the Istanbul Programme of Action highlights the vulnerability of the least developed countries to a variety of shocks and disasters, as well as climate change, and emphasize that these vulnerabilities threaten to undermine many of the development gains that those countries have made over the past decade. The Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 has recognized the higher vulnerability and risk levels of the least developed countries, which often exceed their capacity to respond to and recover from disasters. We reiterate that such vulnerability requires strengthened international cooperation and ensuring genuine, durable regional and international partnerships to improve their resilience. We also note the importance of adopting and implementing national and local disaster risk reduction strategies and plans aimed at preventing the creation of risk, reducing existing risk and strengthening economic, social, health and environmental resilience. We welcome the fact that many of the least developed countries have communicated intended nationally determined contributions and designed and implemented national disaster risk reduction strategies embedded in national development plans with a focus on preventive measures and a multi-stakeholder approach. However, their efforts have had limited success so far, given their capacity and resource constraints, including at the subnational level. Although most of the least developed countries have developed some form of social protection programme, coverage tends to be very limited. 
36.	In this regard, we acknowledge the importance of addressing these vulnerabilities and are taking steps in various multilateral forums to build resilience to many of the multiple crises and other emerging challenges described in the Istanbul Programme of Action, such as the International Development Association Crisis Response Window of the World Bank, which helps countries to respond to natural disasters and other crises, the Least Developed Countries Fund, to which donors announced contributions amounting to $248 million during the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and initiatives of the International Monetary Fund, such as the temporary waiver of interest rates on Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust loans and the provision of grants for debt relief under the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust, which also play an important role in building the resilience of the least developed countries. Measures at both the national and international levels need to be enhanced to mitigate and manage risks and address the vulnerability of the least developed countries to various kinds of shocks and crises. 
37.	We recognize that the least developed countries in conflict and post-conflict situations and those experiencing political instability, or unable to deliver basic State services, have specific structural challenges and require context-specific approaches, including targeted national policies and international support measures to address these challenges and to support peacebuilding, State-building activities and sustainable development. We take note of the principles set out in the New Deal for Engagement in Fragile States by the Group of Seven Plus, countries that are, or have been, affected by conflict. 
38.	We note the convening of the Ministerial Conference on New Partnerships for Productive Capacity-Building in the Least Developed Countries, held in Cotonou, Benin, from 28 to 31 July 2014, the Ministerial Meeting of the Asia-Pacific Least Developed Countries on Graduation and the Post-2015 Development Agenda, held in Kathmandu from 16 to 18 December 2014, and the Ministerial Meeting of the African Least Developed Countries on Structural Transformation, Graduation and the Post-2015 Development Agenda, held in Milan, Italy, from 8 to 10 June 2015. 

II.	Looking forward and recommendations
General recommendations
39.	Planning at both the national and international levels is necessary to realize the concrete objectives contained in the Istanbul Programme of Action. We encourage the least developed countries to continue to integrate the Programme of Action into their national and sectoral development plans and their development partners to continue to integrate the Programme of Action into their national cooperation policy frameworks, programmes and activities, as appropriate. 
40.	We reiterate the principles that guide the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action: country ownership and leadership; an integrated approach; genuine partnerships; result orientation; peace and security, development and human rights; equity; voice and representation; and the balanced role of the State and market considerations. 
41.	We welcome the fact that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 underscore that the most vulnerable countries, including the least developed countries, deserve special attention and reflect the concerns and aspirations of the least developed countries and we recall the decision contained in the 2030 Agenda that effective linkages will be made with the follow-up and review arrangements of all relevant United Nations conferences and processes, including on the least developed countries. We underline the importance of strong synergy in the implementation of the recently adopted agendas and the Istanbul Programme of Action at the national and subnational levels and encourage coordination and coherence in the follow-up of their implementation. 
42.	We also recognize that genuine, effective and durable multi-stakeholder partnerships can play an important role in advancing sustainable development. We will encourage knowledge-sharing and the promotion of cooperation and partnerships between stakeholders, including between Governments, firms, academia and civil society, in sectors contributing to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and in support of country-driven priorities and strategies. At the same time, we commit to pursue an enabling environment for sustainable development at all levels and by all actors to make the global partnership for sustainable development more effective. 
43.	We encourage national statistical capacities in the least developed countries to be strengthened, with the support and cooperation of the international community in order to increase significantly the use and availability of high-quality, timely and reliable data disaggregated by sex, age, geography, income, race, ethnicity, migratory status, disability and other characteristics relevant in national contexts, which are necessary for efficient policymaking and an effective follow-up and review. We encourage the least developed countries to carry out a stocktaking exercise to assess current statistics and data availability for implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals and the Istanbul Programme of Action at the national and local levels, identify data gaps and build statistical capacity to ensure that data for statistics and monitoring of the Goals are available and reliable. Development partners and relevant international organizations should, and the partnerships are encouraged to, provide international cooperation, including through technical and financial support to the least developed countries in this endeavour. 

Productive capacity-building 
44.	We recognize the importance of building productive capacity as a critical enabler for the development and graduation of the least developed countries and call upon those countries and their development partners to ensure enhanced focus on policies and means to address productive capacity-building. We further recognize that private capital flows, in particular FDI, play a complementary and catalytic role in building and strengthening productive capacity in the least developed countries. We call upon the least developed countries to continue to strengthen the underlying investment climate and upon development partners to continue to provide enhanced financial and technical support to those countries to develop productive capacities, including for enhancing the management capacity of the least developed countries. We note that international financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank provide capacity development to the least developed countries through direct technical assistance and training for country authorities and we invite them to further strengthen such support, responding to the demands and needs of those countries, within the framework of existing commitments, in accordance with their national development policies and strategies. 

Graduation 
45.	We recall General Assembly resolutions 59/209 of 20 December 2004 and 67/221 of 21 December 2012 on a smooth transition for countries graduating from the list of least developed countries. We underscore that the efforts of the least developed countries towards graduation are underpinned by their ownership and leadership, as the primary responsibility for development lies with the countries themselves, but they need to be supported by concrete and substantial international partnership measures in a spirit of mutual accountability for development results. 
46.	We urge both the least developed countries and their development partners to undertake more concerted and ambitious efforts to achieve the aim of the Istanbul Programme of Action of enabling half of the least developed countries to meet the criteria for graduation by 2020. It is also important that graduation be seen not as a cut-off point, but as a resolute move towards better and sustained economic development and virtuous and inclusive structural transformation. We emphasize that a successful transition needs to be based on a national smooth transition strategy, elaborated by each graduated country. We encourage development and trading partners and the United Nations system to continue their support for the implementation of transition strategies for the least developed countries, as well as for smooth transition for graduated countries and to avoid any abrupt reductions in either ODA or technical assistance provided to the graduated countries. 
47.	We invite development and trading partners to consider extending to the graduated country trade preferences previously made available as a result of least developed country status, or reducing them in a phased manner in order to avoid their abrupt reduction, on a bilateral basis. 
48.	We recognize the importance of the reviews by the Committee for Development Policy of the graduation criteria for the least developed countries. We recommend that the reviews be comprehensive, taking into account all aspects of the evolving international development context, including relevant agendas. 

Infrastructure and energy 
49.	We recall the goal in the Istanbul Programme of Action to increase total primary energy supply per capita in the least developed countries to the same level as in other developing countries; significantly increase the share of electricity generation through renewable energy sources by 2020; and enhance capacities in energy production, trade and distribution with the aim of ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030. We recognize that financing for infrastructure and universal access to modern energy, including at the subnational level, remains a major challenge for the least developed countries. 
50.	We also stress that special attention should be given to the least developed countries throughout the United Nations Decade of Sustainable Energy for All (2014-2024), as well as within the framework of the Secretary-General's Sustainable Energy for All initiative and the recently held Sustainable Energy for All Forum and the Global Infrastructure Forum, with a view to ensuring the realization of the objective of access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030 and to addressing the infrastructure needs of the least developed countries. 
51.	We call upon the development partners to continue to support efforts by the least developed countries to develop the energy sector in generation, distribution and energy efficiency, including in renewable energy, other clean energy sources and natural gas, inter alia, through enhanced financial and technical assistance and by facilitating private sector investment, in accordance with national priorities and needs. We underline that increasing substantially the share of renewable energy in the energy mix and increasing energy efficiency can support energy access in the least developed countries. Supporting off-grid solutions for access to electricity is an effective and efficient way to improve the energy access situation of the poor. We will work to provide adequate support and facilitate access to clean energy research and technology, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services to the least developed countries. 
52.	We will embed resilient and quality infrastructure investment plans in our national sustainable development strategies, while also strengthening domestic enabling environments. We reaffirm our commitment to provide enhanced financial and technical support for infrastructure development in line with the least developed countries' sectoral and development needs and priorities and use concessional funds, where appropriate, to catalyse and leverage other sources of funding for infrastructure development and management. We will provide technical and financial support for the least developed countries to translate plans into concrete project pipelines, as well as for individual implementable projects, including for feasibility studies, the negotiation of complex contracts and project management. 
53.	We recommend that all forms of finance, tools and mechanisms, including domestic resources, private finance, ODA grants and other forms of international development cooperation, public-private partnerships, concessional and non-concessional loans, blended finance, special-purpose vehicles, non-recourse project financing, risk mitigation instruments, pooled funding structures and other innovative approaches, be utilized. We invite the development finance institutions and the development partners to play a larger and more coordinated role in investing in infrastructure projects in the least developed countries, mitigating and sharing risks and ensuring guarantees. 

Agriculture, food security and nutrition and rural development 
54.	We support the Secretary-General's Zero Hunger Challenge and recommend increasing sustainable and responsible investment, both domestic and international, in sustainable agriculture and food security, the sustainable use of water resources, including through international public and private cooperation in rural and urban infrastructure, nutrition, secure land tenure, agricultural research and extension services, access to markets and to finance, especially for smallholder farmers, building irrigation facilities, technology development and transfer on mutually agreed terms, the promotion of resilient and sustainable agricultural practices and reducing food loss and waste. We reaffirm the commitment to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development, and to increase the economic benefits to the least developed countries that are small island developing States and coastal countries from the sustainable use of marine resources, including through the sustainable management of fisheries, aquaculture and tourism by 2030. 
55.	We furthermore commit to supporting strong economic, social and environmental links between urban, peri-urban and rural areas by strengthening national, regional and local development planning, including through an integrated approach to sustainable water management and strengthening efforts to protect and safeguard the world's cultural and natural heritage. We will also endeavour to increase investments for effective actions to improve people's diets and nutrition, including in emergency situations, with particular emphasis on supporting access to safe drinking water and sanitation services. 
56. 	We recall our commitment to empower women in agriculture, including through women's access to and control over land and other productive assets. 
57.	We reaffirm the need to undertake necessary measures at the national and international levels to increase the agricultural productivity of the least developed countries. We take note of the existing regional frameworks on emergency food reserve mechanisms and recognize the importance of food security in emergency situations and the need for building resilience. In this regard, we invite the international community to consider enhancing such cooperation at the regional level, particularly for the least developed countries. We will continue to explore ways to improve the effectiveness of food reserve mechanisms for dealing with humanitarian food emergencies or as a means to limit price volatility in those countries. We recognize that commodity diversification and value addition as well as the effective participation of the least developed countries in regional and global value chains and in international trade in agricultural products is a critical aspect of the efforts of those countries in reversing their marginalization, building productive capacities, accelerating structural transformation and generating full and productive employment and decent work for all with quick and sustainable impact on poverty eradication. 
58.	We reiterate our commitment to protect, restore and sustainably use terrestrial and water-related ecosystems, including forests, halting biodiversity loss, and tackling land and soil degradation and desertification. This would generate multiple benefits, including food security, improving the living conditions of affected populations, eradicating poverty and contributing to peace and security while enabling the least developed countries to effectively mitigate and adapt to the impact of climate change. We will also promote sustainable consumption and production patterns, including efforts to reduce food losses along production and supply chains, including post-harvest losses. 

Trade and investment 
59.	We reaffirm the pre-eminence of the World Trade Organization as the global forum for the setting and governance of trade rules. We acknowledge the contribution that the rules-based multilateral trading system has made to the strength and stability of the global economy. We reaffirm the value of the World Trade Organization's consistent practice of taking decisions through a transparent, inclusive, consensus-based, member-driven process. 
60.	We take note of the pledge by the members of the World Trade Organization to strengthen the multilateral trading system so that it provides a strong impetus to inclusive prosperity and welfare for all members and responds to the specific development needs of developing country members, in particular the least developed country members. 
61.	We reaffirm our commitment to significantly increase the share of least developed countries' trade in global trade with the aim of doubling the share of least developed countries' exports in global exports by 2020, including by broadening least developed countries' export base. 
62.	In that regard, we urge the least developed countries and their development partners to make use of existing initiatives and programmes, such as the relevant ministerial decisions of the World Trade Organization on duty-free and quota-free market access for the least developed countries and on preferential rules of origin for those countries, as well as aid for trade. We will increase aid for trade support, in particular for the least developed countries; and we will strive to allocate an increasing proportion of aid for trade to the least developed countries, provided according to development cooperation effectiveness principles. We also welcome additional cooperation among developing countries to this end. We encourage the least developed countries to mainstream trade in their national development plans. With this in mind, we welcome the extension of the Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries into phase two and, as the Enhanced Integrated Framework implements the reforms, agreed as necessary for its continuation, we urge members to contribute to the timely replenishment of the Enhanced Integrated Framework Trust Fund, for the effective implementation, without any disruption, of the Framework between 2016 and 2023. 
63.	We urge World Trade Organization members to continue their efforts to accelerate the accession of all the least developed countries engaged in negotiations for World Trade Organization membership and welcome the 2012 guidelines for the accession of the least developed countries to the Organization. 
64.	We call upon all partners who are World Trade Organization members to implement all of the ministerial decisions, especially those that are of benefit to the least developed countries. We also call upon development partners to continue to provide concrete support to the least developed countries for the diversification of their export base, including into dynamic sectors of world trade, and in meeting the requirements of the Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures and the Agreement on Technical Barriers to Trade of the World Trade Organization to assist them in increasing their share in world trade and enhancing domestic value added for exports. 
65.	We reaffirm our joint commitment to promote strategic and regulatory frameworks for FDI and other resource flows to the least developed countries that include vital policy areas such as infrastructure development, trade and trade facilitation, research and development and the transfer of technology on mutually agreed terms. 
66.	To further investment promotion, we also recommend establishing national regulatory and policy frameworks that allow businesses to innovate, invest and transform technology into employment and inclusive economic growth. We also call for greater commitment from the least developed countries and scaled-up international support for regional integration in order to expand markets, to promote trade facilitation by implementing the Agreement on Trade Facilitation of the World Trade Organization, cross-border infrastructure development, regional value chains and regional cooperation, all of which will contribute to regional stability and progress. Effective partnerships between and among Governments, the private sector and civil society are particularly useful in addressing complex and interrelated challenges. 
67.	We recall the decision contained in the Istanbul Programme of Action and reaffirmed in General Assembly resolution 67/220 of 21 December 2012 to adopt, expand and implement investment promotion regimes for the least developed countries. We welcome the decision contained in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda to adopt and implement investment promotion regimes for the least developed countries and the offer to provide financial and technical support for project preparation and contract negotiation, advisory support in investment-related dispute resolution, access to information on investment facilities and risk insurance and guarantees such as through the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. 
68.	We recognize that stronger and more focused policies, activities and strategies by the least developed countries, the home countries of FDI, international organizations and other stakeholders, as appropriate, can help to substantially increase FDI flows to the least developed countries. We encourage the least developed countries to continue to strengthen the underlying investment climate and to establish and maintain national investment promotion facilities, and we encourage development partners to continue to support capacity-building in the least developed countries aimed at improving their abilities to attract FDI. 
69.	In that regard, we invite the Secretary-General, in his capacity as the Chair of the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination, to include the issue of investment promotion regimes for the least developed countries in the agenda of the Board, with a view to enhancing the overall effectiveness of United Nations system support that can contribute to enhancing the flow of FDI to the least developed countries and the ability of those countries to attract such investment. We further invite the Economic and Social Council, at its next annual forum on financing for development follow-up, to discuss adopting and implementing investment promotion regimes for the least developed countries, pursuant to the relevant resolutions on the matter, including General Assembly resolution 69/313 of 27 July 2015 on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the mandate of the annual forum on financing for development follow-up set out therein. We recall that the forum's intergovernmentally agreed conclusions and recommendations will be fed into the overall follow-up and review of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the high-level political forum on sustainable development. 
70.	We call upon the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development to continue to help the least developed countries attract and benefit from FDI, including through its Investment Policy Framework for Sustainable Development, its investment policy reviews, investment guides and other investment promotion activities. We encourage the least developed countries to make more use of those programmes and call upon development partners to continue to fund them on a voluntary basis. We also invite other relevant United Nations entities and international organizations to continue their support to the least developed countries in the area of investment promotion, as appropriate and in line with their respective mandates. 
71.	The least developed countries are also encouraged to utilize existing trade and investment support mechanisms. The World Bank, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development offer several such programmes that address risk insurance and guarantees as well as technical and advisory support for investment-related negotiations and dispute resolution. 

Good governance at all levels 
72.	We recall the objective of the Istanbul Programme of Action of enhancing good governance at all levels, by strengthening democratic processes, institutions and the rule of law; increasing efficiency, coherence, transparency and participation; protecting and promoting human rights; and reducing corruption, and strengthening least developed country Governments' capacity to play an effective role in their economic and social development. Furthering participation, empowering civil society, youth and women, and strengthening collective action will contribute to the eradication of poverty and achieving sustainable development. In that context, we encourage broad participation by the least developed countries in partnerships and other international conventions and initiatives, as appropriate, such as the United Nations Convention against Corruption and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. We also take note of the work of the Open Government Partnership. We further call upon the least developed countries that have not yet done so to make domestic legislation consistent with their particular obligations as members of or States parties to all relevant international agreements. 
73.	We recognize that sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security, and that peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development. In this regard, we acknowledge that the development challenges posed by conflict not only impede, but can reverse decades of development gains. We thus call upon the least developed countries, with the support of development partners, as appropriate, to build the resilience necessary to address the root causes of conflict in their countries and regions. We call upon the international community to support least developed countries in conflict and post-conflict situations and in particular those suffering from internal and cross-border violence, especially the threat of violent extremism and international terrorism, with the view of achieving the realization of peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development. We will also take measures to ensure that women have a role in peacebuilding and State-building. 

Human and social development, children and youth 
74.	We acknowledge that high-quality education and skills development provide the foundation for lifelong learning and broader human development. We therefore support the global commitment to provide high-quality education to all in the least developed countries, including the poorest and most vulnerable, to the end of secondary school, and reaffirm the commitment to enhance technical, vocational and tertiary education and training, ensuring gender equality in access. We also reaffirm that investment in human resources and institutional capacities are required to ensure a diversified and resilient economy, based on a wide range of sectors, to reduce the economic volatility of countries and enable countries to reap the demographic dividend. Technical, vocational and skills development programmes need to take into account the needs of local firms and generate skilled human resources, which can also help firms to invest in the necessary technologies for advancing in the value chain. We will continue our efforts to make further progress in ensuring gender balance in enrolment in and completion of secondary and tertiary education. In this regard, we reiterate our call to development partners to continue to provide and encourage, as appropriate, higher education institutes to allocate scholarships and placements for students and trainees from the least developed countries, in particular in the fields of science, technology, business management and economics. 
75.	We recognize that today's generation of people under the age of 25 is the largest ever in history. Girls and boys, young women and young men are key agents of change in creating a better future and, when empowered, they have great potential to advocate on behalf of themselves and their communities. We will promote and protect the rights of children and youth, ensure more opportunities for their meaningful participation and work towards ending all forms of violence and abuse against children and youth, including exploitation, trafficking, torture and other harmful practices such as female genital mutilation and child, early and forced marriage. We call upon all countries to promote the engagement of children and youth as active members of the global community, now and later in life, and to ensure that no one is left behind. We call upon the least developed countries to develop policies and programmes for supporting youth access to secondary and higher education, vocational training and productive employment and health-care services, especially for young women and girls. We call upon development partners to provide financial and technical assistance to support formal and non-formal education systems, policies and programmes in the least developed countries that provide economic opportunities and productive employment to youth, and to promote youth exchange programmes, including through virtual campuses and other networking mechanisms. 
76.	To enable all people to benefit from growth, we will include full and productive employment and decent work for all as a central objective in our national development strategies. 

Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls 
77.	We reaffirm the essential role of gender equality, the empowerment of women and girls and the realization of their human rights, and of full and productive employment and decent work in achieving sustainable development. Women and girls must enjoy equal access to high-quality education, health, including sexual and reproductive health, access to finance and economic opportunities and resources and political participation, as well as equal opportunities with men and boys for employment and decent work, leadership and decision-making at all levels. We will work for a significant increase in the investments to close the gender gap and strengthen support for institutions, including criminal and civil justice systems, in relation to gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls at all levels. We will continue to support the elimination of all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, including through the engagement of men and boys. 

Financing for development 
78.	We recognize the efforts of the least developed countries to enhance domestic resource generation, and we commit to supporting efforts by the least developed countries to enhance their revenue mobilization, economic growth, product diversification and domestic value addition; to broadening the tax base and continuing efforts to integrate the informal sector into the formal economy in line with country circumstances; and to enhancing revenue administration through modernized, progressive tax systems, improved tax policy and more efficient tax collection and administration. We are committed to reducing corruption and increasing transparency at all levels. We reaffirm our commitment to work to substantially reduce illicit financial flows by 2030 in order to help the least developed countries to mobilize resources. 
79.	We reiterate that an important use of international public finance, including ODA, is to catalyse additional resource mobilization from other sources, public and private. In this regard, we take note of such efforts as the Addis Tax Initiative. We also take note of the platform for collaboration on tax prepared by the International Monetary Fund, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United Nations and the World Bank Group. 
80.	We welcome the work of the Committee of Experts on International Cooperation in Tax Matters, including its subcommittees. 
81.	We recognize that private business activity, investment and innovation are major drivers of productivity, inclusive economic growth and job creation, and that private international capital flows, particularly FDI, along with a stable international financial system, are vital complements to national development efforts. 
82.	We reiterate that the fulfilment of all ODA commitments remains crucial. ODA providers reaffirm their respective ODA commitments, including the commitment by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of GNI for ODA and 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of GNI for ODA to the least developed countries. We are encouraged by those few countries that have met or surpassed their commitment to 0.7 per cent of GNI for ODA and the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of GNI for ODA to the least developed countries. We urge all others to step up efforts to increase their ODA and to make additional concrete efforts towards the ODA targets. We welcome the decision by the European Union which reaffirms its collective commitment to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of GNI for ODA within the time frame of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and undertakes to meet collectively the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of GNI for ODA to the least developed countries in the short term and to reach 0.20 per cent of GNI for ODA to the least developed countries within the time frame of the 2030 Agenda. We encourage ODA providers to consider setting a target to provide at least 0.20 per cent of GNI for ODA to the least developed countries.
83.	We are encouraged by those who are allocating at least 50 per cent of their ODA to the least developed countries. 
84.	We stress the need for the international community to remain vigilant in monitoring the debt situation of the least developed countries and to continue to take effective measures, preferably within existing frameworks, when applicable, to address the debt problem of those countries, including through coordinated policies aimed at fostering debt financing, debt relief, debt restructuring and sound debt management, as appropriate, for the multilateral and bilateral debt owed by the least developed countries to creditors, both public and private. We reiterate our commitment to work through existing initiatives, such as the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative. We reaffirm the importance of transparency in debt management. 
85.	We recognize the significant potential of multilateral development banks and other international development banks in financing sustainable development and providing know-how. 
86.	We encourage the least developed countries, with support from the international community, to develop their capacities to track financial transactions, administer taxation, facilitate customs services and investigate and prosecute offences to contribute to the success of efforts to deal with illicit financial flows. We also encourage international cooperation on tax matters. 
87.	We encourage the use of and improved access to innovative tools, such as mobile banking, payment platforms and digitalized payments, as appropriate, including by women and micro-businesses, and we recognize the role that this can play in promoting financial inclusion, as well as in reducing costs, increasing transparency, improving the speed and security of payments and opening up new markets. 
88.	We call for support for those partnerships and global alliances, such as the Better Than Cash Alliance and its institutional secretariat, the United Nations Capital Development Fund, that expand the reach and adoption of such tools in support of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Istanbul Programme of Action. 
89.	We welcome continued efforts to improve the quality, impact and effectiveness of development cooperation and other international efforts in public finance, including adherence to agreed development cooperation effectiveness principles. We will align activities with national priorities, including by reducing fragmentation, accelerating the untying of aid, particularly for the least developed countries and countries most in need. We will promote country ownership and results orientation and strengthen country systems, use programme-based approaches where appropriate, strengthen partnerships for development, reduce transaction costs and increase transparency and mutual accountability. We will make development more effective and predictable by providing the least developed countries with regular and timely indicative information on planned support in the medium term. 
90.	We commit to pursuing policy coherence and an enabling environment for sustainable development at all levels and by all actors in support of these actions. 

South-South and triangular cooperation 
91.	We recall that South-South cooperation plays an important role in the development of the least developed countries through its contribution to the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action. 
92.	South-South cooperation is an important element of international cooperation for development as a complement to, not a substitute for, North-South cooperation. We recognize its increased importance, different history and particularities and stress that South-South cooperation should be seen as an expression of solidarity among peoples and countries of the South, based on their shared experiences and objectives. It should continue to be guided by the principles of respect for national sovereignty, national ownership and independence, equality, non-conditionality, non-interference in domestic affairs and mutual benefit. 
93.	We welcome the increased contributions of South-South cooperation to poverty eradication and sustainable development. We encourage developing countries to voluntarily step up their efforts to strengthen South-South cooperation and to further improve its development effectiveness in accordance with the provisions of the Nairobi outcome document of the High-level United Nations Conference on South-South Cooperation.10 We also commit to strengthening triangular cooperation as a means of bringing relevant experience and expertise to bear in development cooperation. 

Migration and remittances 
94.	We recognize the positive contribution of migrants for inclusive growth and sustainable development. We also recognize that international migration is a multidimensional reality of major relevance for the development of countries of origin, transit and destination, which requires coherent and comprehensive responses. We will cooperate internationally to ensure safe, orderly and regular migration involving full respect for human rights and the humane treatment of migrants regardless of migration status, of refugees and of displaced persons. Such cooperation should also strengthen the resilience of communities hosting refugees, particularly in developing countries. We underline the right of migrants to return to their country of citizenship, and recall that States must ensure that their returning nationals are duly received. 
95.	We will work towards reducing the average transaction cost of migrant remittances by 2030 to less than 3 per cent of the amount transferred. We are particularly concerned with the cost of remittances in certain low-volume and high-cost corridors. We will work to ensure that no remittance corridor requires charges higher than 5 per cent by 2030, mindful of the need to maintain adequate service coverage, especially for those most in need.
96.	We recognize that remittances from migrant workers are typically wages transferred to families, primarily to meet part of the needs of the recipient households, and cannot be equated to other international financial flows. We will work to ensure that adequate and affordable financial services are available to migrants and their families in both home and host countries. Combining remittance receipts with broader access to other financial services can increase the impact of remittances on growth by facilitating savings and investments. We will take measures to promote the productive investment of remittances, such as in micro-, small and medium-sized enterprises, and ensure that women and men are engaged as equal partners and beneficiaries. 
97.	We will support national authorities to address the most significant obstacles to the continued flow of remittances, such as the trend of banks withdrawing services, to work towards access to remittance transfer services across borders. We will increase coordination among national regulatory authorities to remove obstacles to non-bank remittance service providers accessing payment system infrastructure and promote conditions for cheaper, faster and safer transfer of remittances in both source and recipient countries, including by promoting competitive and transparent market conditions. 

Science, technology and innovation 
98.	We reaffirm our commitment to support efforts by the least developed countries to improve their capacity to develop, access and utilize critical technologies. We acknowledge that an enabling environment and relevant legal frameworks can give firms confidence to invest in advanced technologies and establish research partnerships in the least developed countries and to provide incentives for local firms to develop or adapt their own technologies. We encourage the least developed countries, with support from the international community, to enhance investment in science, technology, engineering and mathematics education and enhance technical, vocational and tertiary education and training and to ensure equal access for women and girls and encourage their participation therein. We also encourage development partners to enhance support for efforts by the least developed countries to create a successful environment for developing, attracting and utilizing new technologies and building domestic capacity and a knowledge base, including through financial and technical assistance and the transfer of technology on mutually agreed terms. 
99.	We reaffirm our commitment to fully operationalize the technology bank for the least developed countries, in view of its potential to foster productive capacity, structural transformation, poverty eradication and sustainable development. In this regard, we take note of General Assembly resolution 70/216 of 22 December 2015, in which the Assembly outlined the steps necessary to launch and operationalize the technology bank, funded by voluntary contributions, by 2017, and to ensure continued support for the technology bank from all relevant stakeholders. We will avoid duplication and promote synergies between the technology bank and the Technology Facilitation Mechanism established in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and close cooperation on both technical and administrative matters with the United Nations inter-agency task team on science, technology and innovation for the Sustainable Development Goals. We welcome the appointment by the Secretary-General of the members of the governing council of the technology bank and the establishment of a trust fund with the flexibility necessary to attract voluntary funding from Member States and other stakeholders. We emphasize that additional details about, inter alia, the specific activities the technology bank will undertake and how those activities will be evaluated will help to mobilize voluntary assistance. We invite the governing council, with the assistance of appropriate technical experts, as needed, and in consultation with Member States, as appropriate, to draft a legal charter to be adopted by the General Assembly before the end of 2016 and to elaborate other detailed operational and policy documents necessary for the operationalization and sustainable functioning of the technology bank. 
100.	We stress that generous and sustained support will be crucial to ensure the success of the technology bank for the least developed countries. We welcome the fact that Turkey will host the technology bank in Gebze, and we call upon the Government of Turkey to continue its support for the technology bank. We urge developed and developing country partners, as well as international organizations, foundations and the private sector, to provide voluntary financial and technical assistance to the technology bank to ensure its effective operation. 
101.	We recognize the importance of ensuring access for poor and excluded households and localities to adapted technologies that can facilitate entry to new markets and provide renewable energy sources, waste management and clean water. 

Resilience-building 
102.	We emphasize that building resilience at the national level, as well as the subnational, community and individual levels, is critical to sustaining hard-won development gains and accelerating progress towards achieving the development aspirations set in the Istanbul Programme of Action. More investment in the capacities and institutions of local authorities, the building of livelihoods, inclusive and rapid growth, disaster preparedness, the application of information and communications technologies and science and technology, social protection and good governance will contribute to strengthening resilience in an effective manner. 
103.	We welcome the Paris Agreement, in which parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change established the global goal on adaptation of enhancing adaptive capacity, strengthening resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate change and recognized that adaptation is a global challenge faced by all, taking into account the urgent and immediate needs of those developing country parties to the Framework Convention that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.
104.	We welcome the fact that the Paris Agreement can play an important role in the transformation to low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient societies and help to build resilience and reduce vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change, taking into account the urgent and immediate needs of those developing country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. 
105.	We call for effective delivery on climate change commitments and access for the least developed countries to all relevant climate change-related funds, as applicable. 
106.	We welcome the decisions of the Board of the Green Climate Fund to aim for a 50:50 balance between mitigation and adaptation over time on a grant-equivalent basis and a floor of 50 per cent of the adaptation allocation for particularly vulnerable countries, including the least developed countries. We welcome the recent pledges to the Least Developed Countries Fund at the twenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, and call upon the developed countries to continue to provide support to vulnerable countries, including the least developed countries, to address their adaptation needs. We encourage other parties to the Framework Convention to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily. 
107.	We stress the importance of developing and implementing holistic disaster risk reduction strategies integrated at all levels in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 and of supporting national and local capacity for disaster prevention, preparedness, mitigation, response, recovery and rehabilitation. In this regard, we call for the continuation of the work in relevant institutions to support efforts by the least developed countries to build their national capacity to respond to various kinds of shocks, including through funds and other tools. 
108.	We urge both development partners and the least developed countries to make full use of various context-specific programmes and instruments that are already in place. In some instances, resilience programmes may require country-level pooled funding mechanisms that provide assistance and reduce transaction costs for a particular least developed country. 
109.	We underline the need to reduce the vulnerability of the least developed countries to economic, natural and environmental shocks and disasters, as well as climate change, and to enhance their ability to meet these and other challenges by strengthening their resilience, and in this regard stress that it is important that all countries and other actors work together to further develop and implement concrete measures on an urgent basis at the national and international levels so as to build the resilience of the least developed countries to withstand economic shocks and mitigate their adverse effects, to withstand and overcome the adverse effects of climate change, to enhance sustainable growth and protect biodiversity and to withstand natural hazards in order to reduce the risk of disasters, as agreed upon in the Istanbul Programme of Action. 
110.	We renew our resolve to fulfil our commitments to further implement the Istanbul Programme of Action, and we underscore the urgency of finding additional solutions to the major challenges facing the least developed countries in a concerted manner. We recognize that the way forward for crisis mitigation and resilience-building requires that coordinated, balanced and integrated actions be taken at all levels, including through the strengthening of existing initiatives, with the aim of building the resilience of the least developed countries in overcoming their vulnerabilities. 
111.	We decide to undertake an in-depth analysis on crisis mitigation and resilience-building for the least developed countries, at the national and international levels, with a view to building and further strengthening crisis mitigation and resilience in the least developed countries, and we request the General Assembly to determine the parameters of this analysis at its seventy-first session. 
112.	We stress the importance of working on conflict prevention and peacebuilding to promote social cohesion and of empowering the least developed countries to become inclusive and resilient to external and internal shocks that could result in new cycles of violence. Conflict prevention measures with adequate early warning and risk assessment tools can assist in avoiding or at least mitigating adverse impacts of shocks. We express our commitment to take early action to prevent extreme violence and armed conflict by supporting and strengthening core governance institutions, strengthening national capacities for conflict prevention and management of ongoing tensions with civil society and marginalized communities, including women and youth, facilitating dialogue and consensus-building, and mainstreaming conflict prevention and early warning in development within the United Nations system through conflict analysis and assessment. 
113.	We note that women and girls, especially those belonging to the poorest segments of society, are among those who are affected disproportionately during and in the aftermath of crises and disasters. We reaffirm our commitment to put in place gender-responsive policies and actions to address crises and disasters, including by ensuring women's full, equal and effective participation and leadership in decision-making, building their capacity for preparedness and resilient livelihoods. 

United Nations system support 
114.	We reiterate that the Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States should continue to fulfil its functions to assist the Secretary-General in the effective follow-up and monitoring of the implementation of the Istanbul Programme of Action and the full mobilization and coordination of all parts of the United Nations system, with a view to facilitating the coordinated implementation of and coherence in the follow-up and monitoring of the Programme of Action at the country, regional and global levels, and should continue to assist in mobilizing international support and resources for the implementation of the Programme of Action. To this end, it should continue its awareness-raising and advocacy work in favour of the least developed countries, in partnership with the relevant parts of the United Nations system, as well as with parliaments, civil society, the media, academia and foundations, and should continue to provide appropriate support to group consultations of least developed countries. 
115.	We reiterate our request to the Secretary-General to ensure the full mobilization and coordination of all parts of the United Nations system to facilitate coordinated implementation and coherence in the follow-up and monitoring of the Istanbul Programme of Action at the national, subregional, regional and global levels. The coordination mechanisms available, such as the United Nations System Chief Executives Board for Coordination and the United Nations Development Group, should be broadly utilized and the inter-agency consultative group should be kept active in this regard. 
116.	We reiterate the importance of effective linkages in the follow-up and review arrangements of all relevant United Nations conferences and processes, including on the least developed countries, small island developing States and landlocked developing countries. 
117.	We reiterate our invitation to the governing bodies of the United Nations funds and programmes and other multilateral organizations and international financial institutions to contribute to implementing the Istanbul Programme of Action and to integrate it into their work programmes, as appropriate and in accordance with their respective mandates. These organizations are invited to participate fully in reviews of the Programme of Action at the national, subregional, regional and global levels. We are concerned that the share of expenditure for the operational activities for development of the United Nations system in the least developed countries is declining. We invite the governing bodies of the organizations of the United Nations development system and other multilateral organizations to prioritize allocations to the least developed countries, as appropriate and in accordance with their respective mandates. 
118.	We reiterate that treating the least developed countries as a group on the basis of their low per capita income, human asset development and economic vulnerability remains the fundamental premise for special measures in their favour, and that wider recognition of least developed country status could stimulate and facilitate better integration of the Istanbul Programme of Action into development policies. We invite the Committee for Development Policy to look into the reasons and consequences of the non-application of the least developed country category by some United Nations development system organizations and to include its findings on this matter in its annual report to the Economic and Social Council. 
119.	We recommit to the broadening and strengthening of the voice and participation of developing countries in international economic decision-making and norm-setting and in global economic governance. We invite the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and the other main international regulatory standard-setting bodies to continue efforts to increase the voice of developing countries in norm-setting processes to ensure that their concerns are taken into consideration. We reiterate that more effective representation of the least developed countries in decision-making at the global level could improve the international environment for the development of the least developed countries. We also reiterate that the international economic system and architecture should be inclusive and responsive to the special development needs of the least developed countries, ensuring their effective participation, voice and representation at all levels.

	Expressing concern that, after the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006), and midway to the 2015 Millennium Development Goals target date, while there has been progress in reducing poverty in some regions, this progress has been uneven and the number of people living in poverty in some countries continues to increase, with women and children constituting the majority of the most affected groups, especially in the least developed countries and in particular in sub-Saharan Africa,
	Encouraged by reductions in poverty in some countries in the recent past, and determined to reinforce and extend this trend to benefit people worldwide,
	Recognizing that mobilizing financial resources for development at the national and international levels and the effective use of those resources are central to a global partnership for development in support of the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals,
	Acknowledging that sustained economic growth, supported by rising productivity and a favourable environment, including private investment and entrepreneurship, is necessary to eradicate poverty, achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and realize a rise in living standards,
	Underlining the priority and urgency given by the Heads of State and Government to the eradication of poverty, as expressed in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic and social fields,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006);5 
	2.	Recognizes that during the implementation of the first Decade the international community adopted, inter alia, the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 the Monterrey Consensus of the International Conference on Financing for Development,6 and the 2005 World Summit Outcome,2 which are mechanisms to focus national, regional and international efforts towards achieving poverty eradication;
	3.	Proclaims the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2008-2017) in order to support, in an efficient and coordinated manner, the internationally agreed development goals related to poverty eradication, including the Millennium Development Goals;

	5.	Urges all Governments, the international community, including the United Nations system, and all other actors to continue to pursue seriously the objective of the eradication of poverty;
	6.	Reaffirms that each country must take primary responsibility for its own development and that the role of national policies and strategies cannot be overemphasized in the achievement of sustainable development, and recognizes that national efforts should be complemented by supportive global programmes, measures and policies aimed at expanding the development opportunities of developing countries, while taking into account national conditions and ensuring respect for national ownership, strategies and sovereignty;
	7.	Reiterates the need to strengthen the leadership role of the United Nations in promoting international cooperation for development, critical for the eradication of poverty;

	11.	Also recognizes that, for developing countries to reach the targets set in the context of national development strategies for the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the goal on the eradication of poverty, and for such poverty eradication strategies to be effective, it is imperative that developing countries be integrated into the world economy and share equitably in the benefits of globalization;
	12.	Further recognizes the importance of official development assistance as a source of financing development for developing countries, calls for the fulfilment of all official development assistance commitments, including the commitments by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance by 2015, and urges those developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete efforts in this regard in accordance with their commitments;
	13.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-third session a report containing recommendations on how to make the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2008-2017) effective, in support of the poverty eradication-related internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals;

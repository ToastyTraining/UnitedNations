[on the report of the First Committee (A/65/410)]
65/67.	Consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 51/45 N of 10 December 1996, 52/38 G of 9 December 1997, 53/77 M of 4 December 1998, 54/54 H of 1 December 1999, 55/33 G of 20 November 2000, 56/24 P of 29 November 2001 and 57/81 of 22 November 2002, its decision 58/519 of 8 December 2003, as well as its resolutions 59/82 of 3 December 2004, and 61/76 of 6 December 2006 and 63/62 of 2 December 2008 entitled "Consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures",
	Convinced that a comprehensive and integrated approach towards certain practical disarmament measures often is a prerequisite to maintaining and consolidating peace and security and thus provides a basis for effective post-conflict peacebuilding; such measures include collection and responsible disposal, preferably through destruction, of weapons obtained through illicit trafficking or illicit manufacture as well as of weapons and ammunition declared by competent national authorities to be surplus to requirements, particularly with regard to small arms and light weapons, unless another form of disposition or use has been officially authorized and provided that such weapons have been duly marked and registered; confidence-building measures; disarmament, demobilization and reintegration of former combatants; demining; and conversion,
	Noting with satisfaction that the international community is more than ever aware of the importance of such practical disarmament measures, especially with regard to the growing problems arising from the excessive accumulation and uncontrolled spread of small arms and light weapons, including their ammunition, which pose a threat to peace and security and reduce the prospects for economic development in many regions, particularly in post-conflict situations,
	Stressing that further efforts are needed in order to develop and effectively implement programmes of practical disarmament in affected areas as part of disarmament, demobilization and reintegration measures so as to complement, on a case-by-case basis, peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts,
	Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on prevention of armed conflict,1 which, inter alia, refers to the role which the proliferation and the illicit transfer of small arms and light weapons play in the context of the build-up and sustaining of conflicts,
	Taking note of the statement by the President of the Security Council of 31 August 20012 underlining the importance of practical disarmament measures in the context of armed conflicts, and, with regard to disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes, emphasizing the importance of measures to contain the security risks stemming from the use of illicit small arms and light weapons,
	Taking note also of the report of the Secretary-General prepared with the assistance of the Group of Governmental Experts on Small Arms3 and, in particular, the recommendations contained therein, as an important contribution to the consolidation of the peace process through practical disarmament measures,
	Welcoming the work of the United Nations Coordinating Action on Small Arms mechanism, which was established by the Secretary-General to bring about a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to this complex and multifaceted global problem,
	Welcoming also the establishment, within the United Nations system, of the Programme of Action Implementation Support System, which provides a comprehensive tool to facilitate international cooperation and assistance for the implementation of practical disarmament measures, including the matching of assistance needs with available resources,
	Welcoming further the reports of the first,4 second,5 third6 and fourth7 biennial meetings of States to consider the implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, which, inter alia, underlined that States are encouraged to build on existing mechanisms, such as the enhanced Programme of Action Implementation Support System, and to consider other ways in which needs and resources can be matched effectively and assistance and cooperation can be more effectively coordinated,8
	1.	Stresses the particular relevance of the "Guidelines on conventional arms control/limitation and disarmament, with particular emphasis on consolidation of peace in the context of General Assembly resolution 51/45 N";9
	2.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures, submitted pursuant to resolution 63/62,10 and encourages Member States as well as regional arrangements and agencies to lend their support to the implementation of recommendations contained therein;
	3.	Emphasizes the importance of including in United Nations-mandated peacekeeping missions, as appropriate and with the consent of the host State, practical disarmament measures aimed at addressing the problem of the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in conjunction with disarmament, demobilization and reintegration programmes aimed at former combatants, with a view to promoting an integrated comprehensive and effective weapons management strategy that would contribute to a sustainable peacebuilding process;
	4.	Welcomes the activities undertaken by the Group of Interested States, and invites the Group to continue to promote, on the basis of lessons learned from previous disarmament and peacebuilding projects, new practical disarmament measures to consolidate peace, especially as undertaken or designed by affected States themselves, regional and subregional organizations as well as United Nations agencies;
	5.	Encourages, in this regard, the Group of Interested States to continue to function as an informal, open and transparent forum supporting the implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,11 and encourages the Group to facilitate the exchange of views on issues related to the United Nations small arms process as well as to facilitate the effective matching of needs and resources in accordance with the outcome of the fourth biennial meeting of States;8 
	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to provide the Office for Disarmament Affairs of the Secretariat with resources adequate for maintaining the Programme of Action Implementation Support System as from 2012, thus securing its important role in identifying and communicating information on needs and resources so as to enhance the implementation of the Programme of Action;
	7.	Encourages Member States, also in the framework of the Group of Interested States, to continue to lend their support to the Secretary-General, relevant international, regional and subregional organizations, in accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations, and non-governmental organizations in responding to requests by Member States to collect and destroy small arms and light weapons, including their ammunition, in post-conflict situations;
	8.	Welcomes the synergies within the multi-stakeholder process, including Governments, the United Nations system, regional and subregional organizations and institutions as well as non-governmental organizations in support of practical disarmament measures and the Programme of Action;
	9.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session a report on the implementation of practical disarmament measures, taking into consideration the activities of the Group of Interested States in this regard;
	10.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-seventh session the item entitled "Consolidation of peace through practical disarmament measures".

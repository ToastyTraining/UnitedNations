	Reiterating that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights and have the potential to contribute constructively to the development and well-being of their societies, and that any doctrine of racial superiority is scientifically false, morally condemnable, socially unjust and dangerous and must be rejected, together with theories that attempt to determine the existence of separate human races,

	Recalling its resolutions 3057 (XXVIII) of 2 November 1973, 38/14 of 22 November 1983 and 48/91 of 20 December 1993, by which it proclaimed the three Decades to Combat Racism and Racial Discrimination, and conscious of the fact that their objectives are yet to be attained,
	Underlining its resolution 67/155 of 20 December 2012, by which it requested the President of the General Assembly, in consultation with Member States, relevant United Nations programmes and organizations and civil society, including non-governmental organizations, to launch an informal consultative preparatory process for the proclamation of the International Decade for People of African Descent, with the theme "People of African descent: recognition, justice and development", with a view to proclaiming the International Decade in 2013,
	Recalling paragraph 61 of its resolution 66/144 of 19 December 2011, by which it encouraged the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent to develop a programme of action, including a theme, for adoption by the Human Rights Council, and in this regard taking note of Council resolution 21/33 of 28 September 2012,2 in which the Council welcomed the draft programme of action for the Decade for People of African Descent3 and decided to transmit it to the General Assembly with a view to its adoption,
	Taking note with appreciation of the work undertaken by the Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent in producing a draft programme of action that is comprehensive and covers a wide range of areas that could serve as a broad framework for the programme of action for the International Decade for People of African Descent, and the report of the Secretary-General on how to make the International Decade effective,4
	1.	Proclaims the International Decade for People of African Descent, commencing on 1 January 2015 and ending on 31 December 2024, with the theme "People of African descent: recognition, justice and development", to be officially launched immediately following the general debate of the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly;

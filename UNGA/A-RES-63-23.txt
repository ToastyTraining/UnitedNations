[without reference to a Main Committee (A/63/L.27 and Add.1)]
63/23.	Promoting development through the reduction and prevention of armed violence


	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming the commitments made by the international community in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 in particular its goal to create an environment conducive to development and the elimination of poverty,
	Recalling the 2005 World Summit Outcome,2
	Recalling also the 2001 Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,3 reflecting, inter alia, the concern with the implications that poverty and underdevelopment may have for the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons in all its aspects,
	Taking note of the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development of 7 June 2006,4 and the regional declarations adopted by regional conferences hosted by the Governments of Guatemala, Kenya and Thailand, having the aim of raising awareness among Member States of the relationship between armed violence and development,
	Reaffirming that development, peace and security, and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing,2
	Stressing the importance of the symbiotic relationship between disarmament and development and the important role of security in this connection,
	Recognizing that sustained socio-economic development and the reduction of inequalities, including measures aimed at improving social inclusion, employment and education, constitute essential requirements for reducing levels of armed violence,
	Taking note of the resolve expressed in the Summit statement,5 adopted at the conclusion of the Review Summit of the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence and Development, to develop goals, targets and measurable indicators on armed violence and development as a complement to the Millennium Development Goals,
	Cognizant of past and ongoing efforts, including within the United Nations system, to achieve the Millennium Development Goals through the prevention and reduction of armed violence at national, regional and international levels,
	Mindful of the primary responsibility of national Governments for curbing armed violence and for fostering the Millennium Development Goals,
	1.	Stresses the need for a coherent and integrated approach to the prevention of armed violence, with a view to achieving sustainable peace and development;
	2.	Requests the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States on the interrelation between armed violence and development and, in close consultation with the relevant agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system, and with the three United Nations regional centres for peace and disarmament, to submit a report to the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session.

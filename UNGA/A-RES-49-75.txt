	Moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling with satisfaction its resolution 48/75 K of 16 December 1993, by which it, inter alia, called upon States to agree to a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines that pose grave dangers to civilian populations, and urged States to implement such a moratorium,

	Noting that there are approximately 85 million or more anti-personnel land-mines in the ground throughout the world and that many thousands of such mines continue to be laid in an indiscriminate manner,

	Expressing deep concern that anti-personnel land-mines kill or maim hundreds of people every week, mostly unarmed civilians, obstruct economic development and reconstruction and have other severe consequences, which include inhibiting the repatriation of refugees and the return of internally displaced persons,

	Welcoming the programmes of assistance which exist for demining and humanitarian support for the victims of anti-personnel land-mines,

	Gravely concerned with the suffering and casualties caused to non-combatants as a result of the proliferation, as well as the indiscriminate and irresponsible use, of anti-personnel land-mines,

	Recognizing that States can move most effectively towards the ultimate goal of the eventual elimination of anti-personnel land-mines as viable and humane alternatives are developed,

	Recalling with satisfaction the report of the Secretary-General 13/ concerning progress on the initiative in the aforementioned resolution,


__________

	13/	A/49/275 of 27 July 1994 and Add.1 of 31 October 1994.
	Convinced that moratoriums by States exporting anti-personnel land-mines that pose grave dangers to civilian populations are important measures in helping to reduce substantially the human and economic costs resulting from the use of such devices,

	Noting with satisfaction that many States already have declared moratoriums on the export, transfer or sale of anti-personnel land-mines and related devices, with many of these moratoriums being declared as a result of the aforementioned resolution,

	Believing that ongoing efforts to strengthen the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate 
Effects, 14/ particularly its Protocol II, 15/ are an important part of the overall effort to address problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines,

	Recalling with satisfaction its resolution 48/7 of 19 October 1993 calling for assistance in mine clearance,

	1.	Welcomes the moratoriums already declared by certain States on the export of anti-personnel land-mines;

	2.	Urges States that have not yet done so to declare such moratoriums at the earliest possible date;

	4.	Emphasizes the importance of the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects and its Protocols as the authoritative international instrument governing the responsible use of anti-personnel land-mines and related devices;

	5.	Urges States that have not done so to adhere to the Convention and its Protocols;

	6.	Encourages further international efforts to seek solutions to the problems caused by anti-personnel land-mines, with a view to their eventual elimination.

	Step-by-step reduction of the nuclear threat

	The General Assembly,

	Bearing in mind the goal of the total elimination of nuclear weapons,

	Desiring to reduce, progressively and systematically, the threat posed by nuclear weapons,

	Welcoming the respite from the intense competition in the accumulation of weapons-grade fissile materials, in the production of nuclear warheads and in the deployment of nuclear-weapon systems which characterized the cold war,

	Mindful that processing of special fissionable material for weapon purposes and production of nuclear warheads continues at a steady pace in some States, and that many thousands of nuclear-weapon systems remain deployed at the brink of war,

	Welcoming also the standing down of some nuclear-weapon systems from full alert and the elimination of certain types of weapons,

	Mindful also that the military doctrines regarding the threat of use of nuclear weapons remain unaltered, and that most agreed reductions do not entail destruction of the nuclear warheads or delivery vehicles,

	Welcoming further the steps taken to increase transparency in armaments and the emerging pattern of closing or converting nuclear-weapon production facilities,

	Mindful further of the continuing lack of internationally verified inventories of the nuclear arsenals and that plans for the redirection of nuclear-weapon facilities to the task of dismantlement of the nuclear arsenals are only at an early state of development,

	Wishing to further current efforts regarding multilateral negotiations and agreements, and conscious of the urgent need for expeditious action for this purpose,

	Confident that the Conference on Disarmament can serve as an effective multilateral disarmament negotiating forum, as envisioned at its 1978 special session devoted to disarmament 16/ and as evidenced recently by the successful conclusion of the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their 
Destruction, 17/

	Persuaded that agreement upon a five- to ten-year agenda on nuclear arms control would provide a needed overall sense of direction to global disarmament efforts,

__________

	16/	See resolution S-10/2, para. 120.

	17/	See Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-seventh Session, Supplement No. 27 (A/47/27), appendix I.

	Convinced that the successful pursuit of such an agenda would significantly advance the goal of the elimination of nuclear weapons from national arsenals,

	1.	Identifies the following general areas for step-by-step reduction of the nuclear threat:

	Area A.  Steps to counter, inter alia:

	(a)	The acquisition and processing of special fissionable material for nuclear-weapon purposes;

	(b)	The manufacture and testing of nuclear warheads and their delivery vehicles;

	(c)	The assembly and deployment of nuclear-weapon systems;

by such means as:

			(i)Prohibiting the test explosion of nuclear weapons;

			(ii)Cutting off the production of special fissile materials for weapon purposes;

			(iii)Ending production of nuclear warheads;

			(iv)Ending the production and testing of intermediate- and long-range ballistic missiles for nuclear-weapon purposes;

			(v)Effective, legally binding measures to deter the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons;

			(vi)Other related measures;

	Area B.  Steps to actuate, inter alia:

	(a)	The withdrawal from deployment and disassembly of nuclear-weapon systems;

	(b)	The secure storage and dismantlement of nuclear warheads and their delivery vehicles;

	(c)	The elimination of special fissionable materials for nuclear-weapon purposes;

by such means as:

			(i)Standing down nuclear-weapon systems from high-alert status;

			(ii)Separating nuclear warheads from their delivery vehicles;

			(iii)Placing nuclear warheads in secure storage;

			(iv)Converting delivery vehicles, where appropriate, to peaceful uses;

			(v)Removing special nuclear materials from warheads;

			(vi)Converting special nuclear materials to non-weapon purposes;

			(vii)Other related measures;

	Area C.  Steps to prepare, under international auspices:

	(a)	An inventory of the nuclear arsenals, including:

		(i)All special fissile materials, nuclear warheads and their delivery vehicles;

			(ii)All facilities devoted to the processing, manufacture, assembly and deployment of those items;

	(b)	A reorientation of those facilities necessary to the task of implementing measures relating to area B;

	(c)	The closure or conversion to peaceful purposes of all other such facilities in furtherance of measures relating to area A;

	2.	Asks Member States, in particular the nuclear-weapon States, to consider steps which they might take unilaterally, bilaterally, or in cooperation with other States to promote progress in the identified areas, and fully to inform the international community of any steps taken in this regard;

	3.	Recommends to the Conference on Disarmament that in 1995 it:

	(a)	Develop from the three general areas identified in paragraph 1 of the present resolution a comprehensive set of practical, verifiable measures for possible negotiation in their next five- and ten-year periods;

	(b)	Determine from that set a year-by-year sequence and combination of negotiations on specific measures to be commenced during the next five- and ten-year periods, with due regard to steps taken pursuant to paragraph 2;

	4.	Requests the Conference on Disarmament to include in its 1995 report to the General Assembly a section on efforts undertaken in accordance with the recommendation set out in paragraph 3;

	5.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fiftieth session an item entitled "Step-by-step reduction of the nuclear threat".

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 2373 (XXII) of 12 June 1968, the annex to which contains the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,18/

	Noting the provisions of article X, paragraph 2, of that Treaty, which stipulates the holding of a conference twenty-five years after the entry into force of the Treaty to decide whether the Treaty shall continue in force indefinitely or shall be extended for an additional fixed period or periods,

	Desirous of ensuring the consolidation of the Treaty with a view to achieving ultimately the elimination of nuclear weapons,

	Aware of the need for the Treaty to attain universal adherence,

	Convinced that the decision on the extension of the Treaty should lead to further progress in nuclear disarmament, in accordance with the preamble and article VI of the Treaty,

	Noting, therefore, the necessity of giving careful consideration to all possible options in order to take a decision that is appropriate and capable of strengthening the non-proliferation regime in the pursuit of the ultimate objective of the elimination of nuclear weapons,

	Conscious of the fact that there are various interpretations which have been expressed concerning the application of article X, paragraph 2, of the Treaty,

	1.	Calls upon States parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to give appropriate consideration to the import of the Treaty in its entirety and with special attention to its article X, paragraph 2;

	2.	Invites States parties to provide their legal interpretations of article X, paragraph 2, of the Treaty and their views on the different options and actions available, for compilation by the Secretary-General as a background document of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of States Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, well before the holding of that Conference.

	of conventional arms

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 46/36 H of 6 December 1991 and its decision 47/419 of 9 December 1992 on international arms transfers,

	Recalling also its resolutions 48/75 F and 48/75 H of 16 December 1993 on international arms transfers and measures to curb the illicit transfer and use of conventional weapons, respectively,

	Realizing the urgent need to resolve conflicts and to diminish tensions and accelerate efforts towards general and complete disarmament with a view to maintaining regional and international peace and security,

	Recognizing that the availability of massive quantities of conventional weapons and especially their illicit transfer, often associated with destabilizing activities, are most disturbing and dangerous phenomena, particularly for the internal situation of affected States and the violation of human rights,

	Stressing the need for effective national control measures on the transfer of conventional weapons,

	Recognizing also the curbing of the illicit transfer of arms as an important contribution to the relaxation of tension and peaceful reconciliation processes,

	Regional disarmament

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolutions 45/58 P of 4 December 1990, 46/36 I of 6 December 1991, 47/52 J of 9 December 1992 and 48/75 I of 16 December 1993 on regional disarmament,

	Believing that the efforts of the international community to move towards the ideal of general and complete disarmament are guided by the inherent human desire for genuine peace and security, the elimination of the danger of war and the release of economic, intellectual and other resources for peaceful pursuits,

	Affirming the abiding commitment of all States to the purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations in the conduct of their international relations,

	Noting that essential guidelines for progress towards general and complete disarmament were adopted at the tenth special session of the General Assembly, 7/

	Taking note of the guidelines and recommendations for regional approaches to disarmament within the context of global security adopted by the Disarmament Commission at its 1993 substantive session, 27/

__________

	27/	Official Records of the General Assembly, Forty-eighth Session, Supplement No. 42 (A/48/42), annex II.

	Welcoming the prospects of genuine progress in the field of disarmament engendered in recent years as a result of negotiations between the two super-Powers,

	Taking note also of the recent proposals for disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation at the regional and subregional levels,

	Recognizing the importance of confidence-building measures for regional and international peace and security,

	Convinced that endeavours by countries to promote regional disarmament, taking into account the specific characteristics of each region and in accordance with the principle of undiminished security at the lowest level of armaments, would enhance the security of smaller States and would thus contribute to international peace and security by reducing the risk of regional conflicts,

	1.	Stresses that sustained efforts are needed, within the framework of the Conference on Disarmament and under the umbrella of the United Nations, to make progress on the entire range of disarmament issues;

	2.	Affirms that global and regional approaches to disarmament complement each other and should therefore be pursued simultaneously to promote regional and international peace and security;

	3.	Calls upon States to conclude agreements, wherever possible, for nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and confidence-building measures at regional and subregional levels;

	4.	Welcomes the initiatives towards disarmament, nuclear non-proliferation and security undertaken by some countries at the regional and subregional levels;

	Conventional arms control at the regional and
	subregional levels

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 48/75 J of 16 December 1993,

	Recognizing the crucial role of conventional arms control in promoting regional and international peace and security,

	Convinced that conventional arms control needs to be pursued primarily in the regional and subregional contexts since most threats to peace and security in the post-cold-war era arise mainly among States located in the same region or subregion,

	Aware that the preservation of a balance in the defence capabilities of States at the lowest level of armaments would contribute to peace and stability and should be a prime objective of conventional arms control,

	Desirous of promoting agreements to strengthen regional peace and security at the lowest possible level of armaments and military forces,

	Believing that militarily significant States, and States with larger military capabilities, have a special responsibility in promoting such agreements for regional security,

	Believing also that one of the principal objectives of conventional arms control should be to prevent the possibility of military attack launched by surprise,

	1.	Decides to give urgent consideration to the issues involved in conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels;

	2.	Requests the Conference on Disarmament, as a first step, to consider the formulation of principles that can serve as a framework for regional agreements on conventional arms control, and looks forward to a report of the Conference on this subject;

	3.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fiftieth session the item entitled "Conventional arms control at the regional and subregional levels".

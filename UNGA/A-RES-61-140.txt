Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 19 December 2006
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/61/437 and Corr.1)]
61/140.	United Nations Literacy Decade: education for all


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 56/116 of 19 December 2001, by which it proclaimed the ten-year period beginning on 1 January 2003 the United Nations Literacy Decade, its resolution 57/166 of 18 December 2002, in which it welcomed the International Plan of Action for the United Nations Literacy Decade, and its resolution 59/149 of 20 December 2004,
	Recalling also the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 in which Member States resolved to ensure that, by 2015, children everywhere, boys and girls alike, will be able to complete a full course of primary schooling and that girls and boys will have equal access to all levels of education, which requires a renewed commitment to promote literacy for all,
	Reaffirming the emphasis placed by the 2005 World Summit on the critical role of both formal and informal education in the achievement of poverty eradication and other development goals as envisaged in the Millennium Declaration, in particular basic education and training for eradicating illiteracy, and the need to strive for expanded secondary and higher education as well as vocational education and technical training, especially for girls and women, the creation of human resources and infrastructure capabilities and the empowerment of those living in poverty,
	Reaffirming also that a basic education is crucial to nation-building, that literacy for all is at the heart of basic education for all and that creating literate environments and societies is essential for achieving the goals of eradicating poverty, reducing child mortality, curbing population growth, achieving gender equality and ensuring sustainable development, peace and democracy,
	Convinced that literacy is crucial to the acquisition by every child, youth and adult of the essential life skills that will enable them to address the challenges that they can face in life and represents an essential step in basic education, which is an indispensable means for effective participation in the societies and economies of the twenty-first century,
	Affirming that the realization of the right to education, especially for girls, contributes to the promotion of gender equality and the eradication of poverty,
	Welcoming the considerable efforts that have been made to address the objectives of the Decade at various levels,
	Noting with deep concern that 771 million adults over the age of 15 lack basic literacy skills worldwide and about 100 million children of primary school age are still not enrolled in primary schools, that the issue of illiteracy may not be sufficiently high on national agendas to generate the kind of political and economic support required to address global illiteracy challenges and that the world is unlikely to meet those challenges if the present trends continue,
	Deeply concerned about the persistence of the gender gap in education, which is reflected by the fact that nearly two thirds of the world's adult illiterates are women,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization on the implementation of the International Plan of Action for the United Nations Literacy Decade;2
	2.	Welcomes the efforts made so far by Member States and the international community in implementing the International Plan of Action;
	3.	Appeals to all Governments to develop reliable literacy data and information and to further reinforce political will, mobilize adequate national resources, develop more inclusive policymaking environments and devise innovative strategies for reaching the poorest and most marginalized groups and for seeking alternative formal and non-formal approaches to learning with a view to achieving the goals of the Decade;
	4.	Urges all Governments to take the lead in coordinating the activities of the Decade at the national level, bringing all relevant national actors together in a sustained dialogue and collaborative action on policy formulation, implementation and evaluation of literacy efforts;
	5.	Appeals to all Governments and professional organizations to strengthen national and professional educational institutions in their countries with a view to expanding their capacity and promoting the quality of education, with particular focus on literacy;
	6.	Appeals to all Governments and to economic and financial organizations and institutions, both national and international, to lend greater financial and material support to the efforts to increase literacy and achieve the goals of Education for All and those of the Decade, through, inter alia, the 20/20 initiative,3 as appropriate;
	7.	Invites Member States, the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, as well as relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, to intensify their efforts to implement effectively the International Plan of Action and to integrate substantially those efforts in the Education for All process and other initiatives and activities of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and within the framework of the internationally agreed development goals, including those contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration;1
	8.	Requests the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to reinforce its lead role in coordinating and catalysing the activities of the Decade at the regional and international levels, prepare and conduct the mid-Decade review in collaboration with all Decade partners during 2007 and 2008 and submit its results to the General Assembly;
	9.	Invites Member States and the relevant intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to take an active part in the preparation and organization of high-level regional conferences, scheduled to be held in 2007-2008 in Qatar, Azerbaijan, Mali, Costa Rica and in Asia and the Pacific, aimed at marshalling high political commitment, building an effective partnership among all the stakeholders and mobilizing resources needed for achieving the goals of the Decade and the International Plan of Action;
	10.	Requests all relevant entities of the United Nations system, particularly the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, in cooperation with national Governments, to take immediate, concrete steps to address the needs of countries with high illiteracy rates and/or with large populations of illiterate adults, with particular regard to women, including through programmes that promote low-cost and effective literacy provisions;
	11.	Requests the Secretary-General, in cooperation with the Director-General of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, to seek the views of Member States on the progress achieved in implementing their national programmes and plans of action for the Decade and to submit the next progress report on the implementation of the International Plan of Action to the General Assembly in 2008;
	12.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-third session, under the item entitled "Social development", the sub-item entitled "United Nations Literacy Decade: education for all".

Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 8 December 2003
[on the report of the First Committee (A/58/463)]
		58/64.	Convention on the Prohibition of the Use of Nuclear Weapons


	The General Assembly,
	Convinced that the use of nuclear weapons poses the most serious threat to the survival of mankind,
	Bearing in mind the advisory opinion of the International Court of Justice of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons,1
	Convinced that a multilateral, universal and binding agreement prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would contribute to the elimination of the nuclear threat and to the climate for negotiations leading to the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons, thereby strengthening international peace and security,
	Conscious that some steps taken by the Russian Federation and the United States of America towards a reduction of their nuclear weapons and the improvement in the international climate can contribute towards the goal of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons,
	Recalling that, in paragraph 58 of the Final Document of the Tenth Special Session of the General Assembly,2 whose twenty-fifth anniversary is being marked this year, it is stated that all States should actively participate in efforts to bring about conditions in international relations among States in which a code of peaceful conduct of nations in international affairs could be agreed upon and that would preclude the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons,
	Reaffirming that any use of nuclear weapons would be a violation of the Charter of the United Nations and a crime against humanity, as declared in its resolutions 1653 (XVI) of 24 November 1961, 33/71 B of 14 December 1978, 34/83 G of 11 December 1979, 35/152 D of 12 December 1980 and 36/92 I of 9 December 1981,
	Determined to achieve an international convention prohibiting the development, production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons, leading to their ultimate destruction,
	Stressing that an international convention on the prohibition of the use of nuclear weapons would be an important step in a phased programme towards the complete elimination of nuclear weapons, with a specified framework of time,
	Noting with regret that the Conference on Disarmament, during its 2003 session, was unable to undertake negotiations on this subject as called for in General Assembly resolution 57/94 of 22 November 2002,
	1.	Reiterates its request to the Conference on Disarmament to commence negotiations in order to reach agreement on an international convention prohibiting the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons under any circumstances;
	2.	Requests the Conference on Disarmament to report to the General Assembly on the results of those negotiations.

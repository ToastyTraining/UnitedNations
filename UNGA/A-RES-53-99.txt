    The General Assembly,

    Reaffirming once again the commitment of the United Nations and its Member States, as well as the States parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice, to the goals of the United Nations Decade of International Law, as expressed by the General Assembly in resolutions under that item of its agenda,1

    Mindful of the long and well-established tradition of progressive development and codification of international law, marked by the first and the second International Peace Conferences, held at The Hague in 1899 and 1907 respectively,

    Recalling that a third international peace conference, scheduled to be held at The Hague in 1915, was not held because of the outbreak of the First World War the previous year,

    Recalling also the proposal by the Russian Federation for a third international peace conference with a view to considering international law and order in the post-cold-war world at the threshold of the twenty-first century, referred to in General Assembly resolution 51/159 of 16 December 1996, and the initiatives undertaken by the  Federation and the Kingdom of the Netherlands with regard to the commemoration of the first International Peace Conference,
    

    Noting with satisfaction that the realization of the programme of action dedicated to the centennial of the first International Peace Conference, presented by the Netherlands and the Russian Federation,2 is consistent with the goals of the United Nations Decade of International Law,

    Noting that the outcome of action pertaining to the centennial of the first International Peace Conference will be submitted to the General Assembly for its consideration at the closing of the United Nations Decade of International Law,

    Noting also that the programme of action does not entail budgetary implications for the United Nations,

    1.	Welcomes the progress made in the realization of the programme of action, presented by the Governments of the Netherlands and the Russian Federation,2 which aims at contributing to the further development of the themes of the first and the second International Peace Conference and could be regarded as a third international peace conference;

    3.	Encourages the competent organs, subsidiary organs, programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations, including the International Court of Justice, the International Law Commission and the Secretariat, within their respective competencies, as well as other international organizations, non-governmental organizations, groups and individuals, as appropriate:

    5.	Requests the Secretary-General to ensure consistency between the activities of the Organization relating to the closing of the United Nations Decade of International Law and those relating to the programme of action and to coordinate with the Governments of the Netherlands and the Russian Federation his efforts with regard to the closing of the Decade;

    6.	Invites the Secretary-General to consider any activities to promote the outcome of the United Nations Decade of International Law, including the possibility of the issuance by the United Nations of a set of jubilee postage stamps and postcards in commemoration of the centennial of the first International Peace Conference;

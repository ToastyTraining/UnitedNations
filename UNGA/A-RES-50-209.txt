	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/50/845)]


50/209.Financing of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Angola Verification Mission 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolution 626 (1988) of 20 December 1988, by which the Council established the United Nations Angola Verification Mission, resolution 696 (1991) of 30 May 1991, by which the Council decided to entrust a new mandate to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission (thenceforth called the United Nations Angola Verification Mission II),  resolution 976 (1995) of 8 February 1995, by which the Council authorized the establishment of a peace-keeping operation in Angola (thenceforth called the United Nations Angola Verification Mission III), and resolution 1008 (1995) of 7 August 1995, in which the Council extended the mandate of the Verification Mission until 8 February 1996,

	Recalling its resolution 43/231 of 16 February 1989 on the financing of the Verification Mission, and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 49/227 B of 20 July 1995,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Verification Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,


	Recalling also its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Verification Mission, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Verification Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	Concerned that the Secretary-General continues to face difficulties in meeting the obligations of the Verification Mission on a current basis, including reimbursement to current and former troop-contributing States,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Angola Verification Mission as at 19 December 1995, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 38,878,476 United States dollars, representing 10 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Verification Mission to the period ending 31 December 1995, notes that some 21 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, particularly those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[without reference to a Main Committee (A/49/L.8/Rev.1)]


49/215.Assistance in mine clearance


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 48/7 on assistance in mine clearance, adopted without a vote on 19 October 1993,

	Affirming its deep concern at the tremendous humanitarian problem caused by the presence of mines and other unexploded devices that have serious and lasting social and economic consequences for the populations of mine-infested countries and constitute an obstacle to the return of refugees and other displaced persons, to humanitarian aid operations and to reconstruction and economic development, as well as to the restoration of normal social conditions,

	Stressing its grave alarm at the ever-increasing presence of mines and other unexploded devices as a result of armed conflicts,

	Deeply concerned that the number of mines being laid each year exponentially outweighs the number of such mines that can be cleared during that time, and convinced of the necessity and urgency of an increase in mine-clearance efforts by the international community,

	Recognizing the importance of recording, where appropriate, the location of mines,





95-76321
	Reiterating its dismay at the high number of victims of mines, especially among civilian populations, and taking note in this context of Commission on Human Rights resolution 1994/94 of 9 March 1994 on the effects of armed conflicts on children's lives, 1/

	Bearing in mind the serious threat that mines and other unexploded devices pose to the safety, the health and the lives of personnel participating in humanitarian, peace-keeping and rehabilitation programmes,

	Recalling, in this regard, its resolution 48/79 of 16 December 1993 on the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects 2/ and the convening by the Secretary-General of a conference to review and amend that Convention, noting in particular, in this regard, the work of the group of governmental experts at present engaged in preparing the review of the Convention and especially the Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby Traps and Other Devices (Protocol II) 2/ as a matter of priority,

	Recalling also its resolution 48/75 K of 16 December 1993, calling for a moratorium on the export of anti-personnel land-mines,

	Bearing in mind that significant progress needs to be achieved in these fields,

	Recognizing that, in addition to the primary role of States, the United Nations has an important role in the field of assistance in mine clearance,

	Welcoming, in this regard, the efforts made by the United Nations to foster the establishment of national mine-clearance capacities in countries where mines constitute a serious threat to the safety, health and lives of the local population,

	Noting with satisfaction the inclusion in the mandates of several peace-keeping operations of provisions relating to mine-clearance work carried out under the direction of the Department of Peace-keeping Operations of the Secretariat, in the context of such operations,

	Commending the activities already undertaken by the United Nations system, donor and recipient Governments, the International Committee of the Red Cross and non-governmental organizations to address solutions of problems relating to the presence of mines and other unexploded devices,

	Commending in particular the activities already undertaken by the Secretary-General, especially the establishment in the Secretariat of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs as a focal point within the United Nations for coordinating de-mining and related issues,

	Reaffirming that all Member States have an obligation to promote and protect human rights and fundamental freedoms and to fulfil the obligations they have under the human rights instruments to which they are party, and reaffirming also the obligation of all to respect international humanitarian law,

	Welcoming the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina 10/ initialled by the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), representing also the Bosnian Serb party, at Dayton, Ohio, on 21 November 1995 which commits the parties to the conflict to ending the war and starting to build peace with justice; enables Bosnia and Herzegovina to continue its legal existence as a single State within its internationally recognized borders with full respect for its sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence by its neighbours; and commits the parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina to respect fully human rights,

	Welcoming also the basic agreement on the region of Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and Western Sirmium, 11/ signed on 12 November 1995 by the Government of the Republic of Croatia and the local Serb representatives,

	None the less gravely concerned at the human tragedy that has occurred in the territories of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and at the massive and systematic violations of human rights and international humanitarian law,

	Recalling its resolution 49/196 of 23 December 1994, Commission on Human  Rights resolution 1995/89 of 8 March 1995 12/ and all relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	Recalling specifically the Security Council resolutions in which the Council demanded, inter alia, that all parties and others concerned in the former Yugoslavia immediately cease and desist from all breaches of international humanitarian law, requested the Secretary-General to establish a commission of experts to examine and analyse information relating to serious violations of such law being committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, established an international tribunal for the prosecution of persons responsible for such violations and condemned in particular the unacceptable practice of ethnic cleansing perpetrated in areas of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina under the control of Bosnian Serb forces,

	Recalling also additional Security Council resolutions, in particular resolutions 824 (1993) of 6 May 1993 and 836 (1993) of 4 June 1993, in which the Council declared that Sarajevo, Tuzla, _epa, Gora_de, Biha_, Srebrenica and their surroundings should be treated as safe areas, that international humanitarian agencies should be given free and unimpeded access to those areas and that there should be freedom of movement for the civilian population and humanitarian goods to, from and within the areas,

	Gravely concerned at attacks and capture by the Bosnian Serbs and Croatian Serb forces of safe areas, in violation of the relevant Security Council resolutions,

	Gravely concerned at the human rights violations in the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Republic of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), in particular at those committed in the context of the odious practice of ethnic cleansing, which has been the direct cause of the vast majority of human rights violations there and whose principal victims have been the Muslim population, as well as the Croats and others,

	Expressing its deep appreciation for the activity and efforts of the previous Special Rapporteur, Mr. Tadeusz Mazowiecki, in the discharge of his mandate,

	7.	Welcomes the withdrawal of the heavy weapons surrounding Sarajevo following the decision to implement Security Council resolution 836 (1993), reinforced by the London conference of 21 July 1995, to respond to attacks on safe areas, and notes that this opened Sarajevo to badly needed humanitarian relief;

	8.	Notes with appreciation the efforts of the International Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia since 1991, established pursuant to Security Council resolutions 806 (1993) of 5 February 1993 and 827 (1993) of 25 May 1993, notes the issuance of indictments against individuals, and urges that the Tribunal be given the resources it needs;

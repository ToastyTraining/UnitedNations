I
Conditions of service applicable to both categories of staff

Mandatory age of separation

II
Conditions of service of staff in the Professional
and higher categories

A.	Base/floor salary scale
	Recalling its resolution 44/198, by which it established a floor net salary level for staff in the Professional and higher categories by reference to the corresponding base net salary levels of officials in comparable positions serving at the base city of the comparator civil service (the United States federal civil service),

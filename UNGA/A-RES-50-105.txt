	Reaffirming that people are central to all activities related to development and that human resources development is an essential means of achieving sustainable development goals,

	Recognizing that human resources development should contribute to total human development, which enlarges the choices available to people in developing their lives and fulfilling their aspirations, and that there is a need to integrate human resources development into comprehensive strategies for human development that mainstreams a gender perspective, taking into account the needs of all people, in particular the needs of women,

	Stressing that there is need for a supportive and favourable international economic environment that will enhance human development in developing countries and promote economic growth and development,

	Recognizing that, while economic reforms and structural adjustment programmes are intended to promote economic growth and development, elements of such programmes may have an adverse impact on human resources development, and also that there is a need to take action, in the formulation and implementation of these programmes, to mitigate any negative effects,

	Stressing the need for adequate resources to enhance the capacity of Governments of developing countries to promote human resources development in pursuit of their national programmes, plans and strategies for development,


	Stressing also that Governments of developing countries have the primary responsibility for defining and implementing appropriate policies for human resources development,

	Recognizing the vital role that South-South and North-South cooperation play in supporting national efforts in human resources development, bilaterally as well as multilaterally,

	Emphasizing the need for coordination and integration among the organs and organizations of the United Nations system in assisting developing countries to foster the development of their human resources, especially that of the most vulnerable, and for the United Nations to continue to give priority to human resources development in developing countries,

	Recognizing the importance accorded in the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and in the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development to the human component of development, 1/

	Recognizing also the importance of the Platform for Action adopted at the recently concluded Fourth World Conference on Women, 2/ held at Beijing from 4 to 15 September 1995,

	1.	Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on developing human resources for development; 3/

	2.	Emphasizes that, in the development of human resources, an overall, well-conceived and integrated approach that mainstreams a gender perspective and takes into account the needs of all people should be adopted, incorporating such vital areas as population, health, nutrition, water, sanitation, housing, communications, education and training, and science and technology, as well as taking into account the need to create more opportunities for employment in an environment that guarantees opportunities for political freedom, popular participation, respect for human rights, justice and equity, all of which are essential for enhancing human capacity to meet the challenge of development;

	3.	Encourages all countries to accord priority, in particular in national budgets, to human resources development in the context of the adoption of economic and social policies;

	8.	Also emphasizes that Governments and relevant institutions should ensure, where appropriate, an adequate social safety net under structural adjustment programmes and should develop policies to reduce the negative effects of these programmes and to improve their positive impact, bearing in mind that social safety nets associated with economic restructuring are short-term by nature and should be considered as complementary strategies;

Notes with serious concern the worrisome trend of a decrease in overall development assistance, which affects the level of resources for human resources development, and emphasizes that financial commitment to human resources development is of critical importance in contributing to the enhancement of the concept of people-centred sustainable development;

	4.	Requests the secretariat of the Conference to extend the deadline for application for accreditation by non-governmental organizations until 28 April 1995, to continue to consider applications received by that date and to ensure that those applications are considered in a transparent manner, in accordance with the criteria set forth in the annex to resolution 48/108;

	5.	Also requests the secretariat of the Conference, prior to the convening of the substantive session of 1995 of the Economic and Social Council, to prepare a list of those non-governmental organizations referred to in paragraphs 1 and 4 which, considering all available information, appear to have met the criteria set forth in the annex to resolution 48/108 for accreditation to the Conference;

	Recalling Human Rights Council resolution 21/11 of 27 September 2012,14 by which the Council adopted the guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights15 as a useful tool for States in the formulation and implementation of poverty reduction and eradication policies, as appropriate,
	Reaffirming the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, welcoming the high-level plenary meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals, and recalling its outcome document, contained in resolution 65/1 of 22 September 2010,
	Taking note of the fact that the proposal contained in the report16 of the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals shall be the main basis for integrating sustainable development goals into the post-2015 development agenda, while recognizing that other inputs will also be considered, in the intergovernmental negotiation process at the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, and noting that the report includes a goal on eradicating poverty in all its forms everywhere,
	Concerned that, during the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2008-2017), while there has been progress in reducing poverty, especially in some middle-income countries, such progress has been uneven and the number of people living in poverty in some countries continues to increase, with women and children constituting the majority of those most affected, especially in the least developed countries and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,
	Deeply concerned that extreme poverty persists in all countries of the world, regardless of their economic, social and cultural situation, and that its extent and its manifestations, such as social exclusion, hunger, trafficking in human beings, disease, lack of adequate shelter, illiteracy and hopelessness, are particularly severe in developing countries, while acknowledging the significant progress made in several parts of the world in combating extreme poverty,
	Deeply concerned also that gender inequality, violence and discrimination exacerbate extreme poverty, disproportionally impacting women and girls,
	Stressing that special attention should be given to those who are living in extreme poverty and in vulnerable situations, in particular women, children, youth, older persons, persons with disabilities and indigenous peoples,
	Concerned by the challenges faced today, including those derived from the ongoing impact of the financial and economic crisis, the food crisis and ongoing concerns over food security, as well as the increasing challenges posed by climate change and the loss of biodiversity, and by the resulting increase in the number of people living in extreme poverty and their negative effect on the capacity of all States, especially developing countries, to fight extreme poverty,
	Recognizing that the eradication of extreme poverty is a major challenge within the process of globalization that requires the coordination and continuation of inclusive policies through decisive national action and international cooperation,
	Recognizing also that social protection systems make a critical contribution to the realization of human rights for all, in particular for those who are in vulnerable or marginalized situations and are trapped in poverty and subject to discrimination,
	Recognizing further that persistent and growing inequalities within countries are a major challenge to poverty eradication, particularly affecting those who are living in extreme poverty and in vulnerable situations,
	Stressing the necessity of better understanding and addressing the multidimensional causes and consequences of extreme poverty,
	Reaffirming that, since the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full and effective enjoyment of all human rights and may, in some situations, constitute a threat to the right to life, its immediate alleviation and eventual eradication must remain a high priority for the international community,
	Stressing that respect for all human rights, which are universal, indivisible, interdependent and interrelated, is of crucial importance for all policies and programmes to fight extreme poverty,
	Underlining the priority and urgency given by Heads of State and Government to the eradication of extreme poverty, as expressed in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields,
	Reaffirming that democracy, development and the full and effective enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms are interdependent and mutually reinforcing and that they contribute to the eradication of extreme poverty,
	1.	Reaffirms that extreme poverty and exclusion from society constitute a violation of human dignity and that urgent national and international action is therefore required to eliminate them;
	2.	Also reaffirms that it is essential for States to foster participation by the poorest people in the decision-making process in the societies in which they live, in the promotion of human rights and in efforts to combat extreme poverty and exclusion and that it is essential for people living in and affected by poverty and in situations of vulnerability to be empowered to organize themselves and to participate in all aspects of political, economic, social and cultural life, in particular the planning and implementation of policies that affect them, thus enabling them to become genuine partners in development;
	3.	Emphasizes that extreme poverty is a major issue to be addressed by Governments, civil society, community-based social organizations and the United Nations system, including international financial institutions, and in this context reaffirms that political commitment is a prerequisite for the eradication of poverty;
	4.	Also emphasizes the need to accord due consideration and priority to poverty eradication within the United Nations development agenda, while stressing the importance of addressing the causes and challenges of poverty through integrated, coordinated and coherent strategies at the national, intergovernmental and inter-agency levels, consistent with the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields;
	5.	Reaffirms that the existence of widespread extreme poverty inhibits the full and effective enjoyment of human rights and renders democracy and popular participation fragile;
	6.	Recognizes the need to promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in order to address the most pressing social needs of people living in poverty, including through the design and development of appropriate mechanisms to strengthen and consolidate democratic institutions and governance;
	7.	Reaffirms the commitments contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,17 in particular the commitments to spare no effort to fight against extreme poverty and to achieve development and poverty eradication, including the commitment to halve, by 2015, the proportion of the world's people whose income is less than one United States dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger;
	8.	Also reaffirms the commitment made at the 2005 World Summit to eradicate poverty and promote sustained economic growth, sustainable development and global prosperity for all, including women and girls;18

	10.

	11.	Acknowledges that, in its report,16 the Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals reiterated that poverty eradication is the greatest challenge facing the world today and included  the goal to end poverty in all its forms everywhere, with a specific target to eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than 1.25 dollars a day, by 2030;
	12.	Recalls that promoting universal access to social services and providing social protection floors can make an important contribution to consolidating and achieving further development gains and that social protection systems that address and reduce inequality and social exclusion are essential for protecting the gains made towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, and in this regard takes note of International Labour Organization Recommendation No. 202 on social protection floors;
	13.	Encourages States, when designing, implementing, monitoring and evaluating social protection programmes, to ensure gender mainstreaming and the promotion and protection of all human rights in accordance with their obligations under international human rights law, throughout this process;
	14.	Also encourages States to take all necessary measures to eliminate discrimination against all persons, in particular those living in poverty, to refrain from adopting any laws, regulations or practices denying or limiting the enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms, including economic, social and cultural rights, and to ensure that people, in particular those living in poverty, have equal access to justice;
	15.	Welcomes the ongoing efforts to strengthen and support South-South cooperation and triangular cooperation, recognizing their contributions to the efforts of developing countries to collaborate in the eradication of poverty, and stresses that South-South cooperation is not a substitute for, but rather a complement to, North-South cooperation;
	16.	Encourages the international community to strengthen its efforts to address challenges that are contributing to extreme poverty, including those derived from the ongoing impact of the financial and economic crisis, the food crisis and ongoing concerns over food security, as well as the increasing challenges posed by climate change and the loss of biodiversity in all parts of the world, especially in developing countries, by enhancing cooperation to help to build national capacities;
	17.	Reaffirms the critical role of both formal and informal education in the achievement of poverty eradication and other development goals, as envisaged in the Millennium Declaration, in particular basic education and training for eradicating illiteracy, efforts towards expanded secondary and higher education as well as vocational education and technical training, especially for girls and women, the creation of human resources and infrastructure capabilities and the empowerment of those living in poverty, reaffirms in this context the Dakar Framework for Action, adopted at the World Education Forum on 28 April 2000,20 and recognizes the importance of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization strategy for the eradication of poverty, especially extreme poverty, in supporting the Education for All programmes as tools for achieving the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary education by 2015;
	18.	Invites the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to continue to give high priority to the question of the relationship between extreme poverty and human rights, and also invites his Office to pursue further work in this area;
	19.	Calls upon States, United Nations bodies, in particular the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and the United Nations Development Programme, intergovernmental organizations and non-governmental organizations to continue to give appropriate attention to the links between human rights and extreme poverty, and encourages the private sector and international financial institutions to proceed likewise;
	20.	Takes note with appreciation of the guiding principles on extreme poverty and human rights,15 adopted by the Human Rights Council in its resolution 21/11,14 as a useful tool for States in the formulation and implementation of poverty reduction and eradication policies, as appropriate;

	Aware of the devastating impact of crime on the national economies of African States and of the fact that crime is a major obstacle to harmonious and sustainable development in Africa, 
	Noting that the financial situation of the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders has greatly affected its capacity to deliver its services to African Member States in an effective and comprehensive manner,

	2.	Also commends the initiative of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime in strengthening its working relationship with the Institute by supporting and involving the Institute in the implementation of a number of activities, including those contained in the Programme of Action, 2006-2010, on strengthening the rule of law and the criminal justice systems in Africa;2
	3.	Further commends the Secretary-General for his efforts to mobilize the financial resources necessary to provide the Institute with the core professional staff required to enable it to function effectively in the fulfilment of its mandated obligations;

	12.	Requests the Secretary-General to enhance the promotion of regional cooperation, coordination and collaboration in the fight against crime, especially in its transnational dimension, which cannot be dealt with adequately by national action alone;

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[without reference to a Main Committee (A/54/L.61 and Add.1)]


54/114.	Global implications of the year 2000 date conversion problem of computers 

    The General Assembly,

    Recalling its resolutions 52/233 of 26 June 1998 and 53/86 of 7 December 1998, entitled "Global implications of the year 2000 date conversion problem of computers",

    Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General entitled "Steps taken within the United Nations system and with Member States to resolve the year 2000 date conversion of computers",1

    Recognizing that the effective operation of Governments, companies and other organizations is threatened by the year 2000 date conversion problem of computers, or "millennium bug",

    Underlining the need for effective action to address the problem to be intensified as the inflexible date of 31 December 1999 draws nearer and nearer, beyond which important systems might cease to function,

    Recognizing the potentially serious impact that the year 2000 problem could have in all countries whose economies are increasingly interdependent,


    Emphasizing that the year 2000 problem could affect both computer systems and much electronic control equipment containing embedded chips and internal clocks, with wide-ranging effects on such important areas as power supplies, telecommunications, financial systems, transport, public health, building and factory systems, food supplies, emergency services and government services, including the organization of social welfare,

    Emphasizing also that continued coordinated efforts by Governments and private, public and international organizations are required to address the year 2000 problem,

    Noting that year 2000 effects are not limited to 1 January 2000, but may continue throughout the year as systems continue to use date-based information for monthly calculations and operations,

    Appreciating the establishment of a trust fund by the World Bank to assist in the efforts to resolve the year 2000 problem and the voluntary contributions made to it by the Member States,

    Appreciating also the efforts of the Ad Hoc Open-ended Working Group on Informatics of the Economic and Social Council in raising the level of awareness of the year 2000 problem,

    1.	Requests all Member States to continue their efforts to solve the year 2000 problem before the rollover date of 31 December 1999, including by working to ensure that the private sector is fully engaged in addressing the problem and by tackling it in those systems under their own control;

    2.	Urges Member States to take "best practices" measures, such as virus scanning, against the additional potential risk of malicious software which could be injected into systems with the intent of causing malfunctions or facilitating illegal access to information and which are meant to be mistaken for lack of year 2000 compliance;

    3.	Urges all Member States to emphasize the importance of contingency planning and to finalize such plans in order to address the potential for possible large-scale failures in the public and private sectors;

    4.	Urges Member States to set up and participate in national and regional mechanisms for service restoration in the event of service outages after 1 January 2000 attributable to the year 2000 problem;

    5.	Appeals to all Member States to forge global cooperation to ensure a timely and effective response to the year 2000 challenge and to work together to address the threats the problem poses globally and, in this regard, to cooperate with each other in the event of some Member States not having the capacity to correct service outages, through sharing information on significant events and on countermeasures taken, as well as causes, results and prospects of restoration of services, sharing resources in terms of knowledge, skills, products and solutions to offset the significant events and, where feasible, sending sector-specific experts and/or consultants to neighbouring countries;

    6.	Calls upon Governments, public and private sector organizations and civil society generally to share, locally, regionally and globally, information about their experiences in addressing the year 2000 problem;

    7.	Requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the United Nations system closely monitors actual and potential sources of funding to support the efforts of the developing countries and countries with economies in transition to address the year 2000 problem and to facilitate the dissemination of relevant information on those funding possibilities to the Member States;

    8.	Urges the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat to be ready to respond to any humanitarian emergencies that could be caused by serious year 2000 failures;
    
    9.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its fifty-fifth session a final report on the evaluation of the outcome of the steps taken within the United Nations system and with Member States to resolve the year 2000 problem.

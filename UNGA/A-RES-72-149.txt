	Taking note with appreciation of the adoption by the International Labour Conference on 16 June 2011, at its 100th session, of the Domestic Workers Convention, 2011 (No. 189) and of the Domestic Workers Recommendation, 2011 (No. 201), and the entry into force of the Convention on 5 September 2013, and inviting States to consider ratifying it, encouraging States parties to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women to take note of and consider general recommendation No. 26 (2008) on women migrant workers, adopted by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women in November 2008,17 and encouraging States parties to the International Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families18 to take note of and consider general comment No. 1 on migrant domestic workers, adopted by the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families in December 2010,19 acknowledging that they are complementary and mutually reinforcing,
	Recognizing the urgency of combating trafficking in persons in all its forms, including for the purposes of forced or compulsory labour, particularly of women migrant workers, and in this regard taking note of the adoption by the International Labour Conference on 11 June 2014, at its 103rd session, of the Protocol to the Forced Labour Convention, 1930 (No. 29), and of Recommendation No. 203 on supplementary measures for the effective suppression of forced labour, of the International Labour Organization,
	Recognizing also the increasing participation of women of all skill levels in international migration, driven in large part by socioeconomic factors, and that this feminization of migration requires greater gender sensitivity in all policies and efforts related to the subject of international migration,
	Recognizing further that the demand for migrant care work appears to be rising, where the failure to resolve care deficits and secure public provision of care has increased the demand for care work, particularly in the private sphere, and that some migrant workers engaged in informal care work, particularly women, face serious human rights abuses owing to the invisible nature of their workplace, while many benefit from the economic opportunities offered by care work,
	Recognizing the roles and responsibilities of and need for cooperation among all stakeholders, in particular countries of origin, transit and destination, relevant regional and international organizations, the private sector and civil society, in promoting an environment that prevents and addresses violence against women migrant workers, including in the context of discrimination, through targeted measures, and in this regard recognizing the importance of joint and collaborative approaches and strategies at the national, bilateral, regional and international levels,

	Expressing deep concern at the continuing reports of grave abuses and violence committed against migrant women and girls, including gender-based violence, sexual violence, domestic violence, gender-related killing of women and girls, including femicide, racist and xenophobic acts, discrimination, abusive labour practices, exploitative conditions of work and trafficking in persons, including forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, while taking into account the particular difficulties in accessing justice that may be faced by women migrant workers,
	Recognizing that one of the key causes of the labour exploitation suffered by migrants, including women migrant workers, is linked to the unscrupulous practices of some recruitment agencies and informal brokers that charge high recruitment fees, and noting with concern the reports of abuse committed by some recruitment agencies and employers,
	Recognizing also that violence against women and girls, in particular migrant women, is rooted in historical and structural inequality in power relations between women and men, which further reinforces gender stereotypes and barriers to the full enjoyment by women and girls of their human rights,
	Recognizing further that the intersection of, inter alia, age, class, race and gender-based and ethnic discrimination and stereotypes can compound the discrimination faced by women migrant workers and that gender-based violence is a form of discrimination,
	Reaffirming the commitment to respect, protect and promote the human rights of all women, including, without discrimination, indigenous women who migrate for work, and in this regard noting the attention paid in the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples20 to the elimination of all forms of violence and discrimination against indigenous women, as appropriate,
	Stressing the multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination that may be faced by indigenous migrant women, who suffer at a disproportionately high rate from domestic violence and sexual abuse, and as victims of trafficking in persons,
	Concerned that many migrant women who are employed in the informal economy and in less skilled work are especially vulnerable to abuse and exploitation, underlining in this regard the obligation of States to protect the human rights of migrants so as to prevent and address abuse and exploitation, observing with concern that many women migrant workers take on jobs for which they may be overqualified and in which, at the same time, they may be more vulnerable because of poor pay and inadequate social protection, and in this regard taking note of the adoption by the International Labour Conference on 12 June 2015, at its 104th session, of Recommendation No. 204 concerning the transition from the informal to the formal economy,
	Concerned also that migrant women in informal employment may benefit only from limited legal protection of their labour rights, increasing the risk of exploitation,
	Emphasizing the need for objective, comprehensive and broad-based information, including sex- and age-disaggregated data and statistics, and gender-sensitive indicators for research and analysis, and a wide exchange of experience and lessons learned by individual Member States and civil society in the formulation of targeted policies and concrete strategies to specifically address violence against women migrant workers, including in the context of discrimination,
	Realizing that the movement of a significant number of women migrant workers may be facilitated and made possible by means of fraudulent or irregular documentation and sham marriages with the object of migration, that this may be facilitated through, inter alia, the Internet and that those women migrant workers are more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation,
	Recognizing the importance of exploring the link between migration and trafficking in persons in order to further efforts towards protecting women migrant workers from violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse and to provide appropriate care, assistance and services for trafficking victims, regardless of migratory status,
	Recognizing also that the vulnerabilities documented for women migrant workers highlight increasingly complex migration contexts and channels, where migrant workers may find themselves in life-threatening situations when entering other countries,
	Highlighting measures adopted by some countries of destination to alleviate the plight of women migrant workers residing in their areas of jurisdiction and to promote access to justice, including through the establishment of gender-sensitive protection mechanisms for migrant workers, by facilitating their access to mechanisms for reporting complaints or providing assistance during legal proceedings and by promoting actions to protect migrant women who are victims of violence,
	Underlining the important role of relevant United Nations treaty bodies in monitoring the implementation of human rights conventions and of the relevant special procedures, as well as of the supervisory mechanisms of the International Labour Organization, in monitoring the implementation of international labour standards, within their respective mandates, in addressing the problem of violence against women migrant workers and in protecting and promoting their human rights and welfare,

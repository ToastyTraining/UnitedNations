Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 26 November 2007
[without reference to a Main Committee (A/62/L.16 and Add.1)]
62/11.	The role of diamonds in fuelling conflict: breaking the link between the illicit transaction of rough diamonds and armed conflict as a contribution to prevention and settlement of conflicts


	The General Assembly,
	Recognizing that the trade in conflict diamonds continues to be a matter of serious international concern, which can be directly linked to the fuelling of armed conflict, the activities of rebel movements aimed at undermining or overthrowing legitimate Governments and the illicit traffic in and proliferation of armaments, especially small arms and light weapons,
	Recognizing also the devastating impact of conflicts fuelled by the trade in conflict diamonds on the peace, safety and security of people in affected countries, and the systematic and gross human rights violations that have been perpetrated in such conflicts,
	Noting the negative impact of such conflicts on regional stability and the obligations placed upon States by the Charter of the United Nations regarding the maintenance of international peace and security,
	Recognizing, therefore, that continued action to curb the trade in conflict diamonds is imperative,
	Recalling that the elimination of illicit diamonds from legitimate trade is the primary objective of the Kimberley Process,
	Bearing in mind the positive benefits of the legitimate diamond trade to producing countries, and underlining the need for continued international action to prevent the problem of conflict diamonds from negatively affecting the trade in legitimate diamonds, which makes a critical contribution to the economies of many of the producing, exporting and importing States, especially developing States,
	Noting that the vast majority of rough diamonds produced in the world are from legitimate sources,
	Recalling the Charter and all the relevant resolutions of the Security Council related to conflict diamonds, and determined to contribute to and support the implementation of the measures provided for in those resolutions,
	Recalling also Security Council resolution 1459 (2003) of 28 January 2003, in which the Council strongly supported the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme1 as a valuable contribution against trafficking in conflict diamonds,
	Welcoming the important contribution of the Kimberley Process, which was initiated by African diamond-producing countries,
	Acknowledging that lessons learned from the Kimberley Process are useful for the work of the Peacebuilding Commission in its consideration of the countries included in its agenda, as appropriate,
	Noting with satisfaction that the implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme continues to have a positive impact in reducing the opportunity for conflict diamonds to play a role in fuelling armed conflict and would help to protect legitimate trade and ensure the effective implementation of the relevant resolutions on trade in conflict diamonds,
	Recalling its resolutions 55/56 of 1 December 2000, 56/263 of 13 March 2002, 57/302 of 15 April 2003, 58/290 of 14 April 2004, 59/144 of 15 December 2004, 60/182 of 20 December 2005 and 61/28 of 4 December 2006, in which it called for the development and implementation as well as a periodic review of proposals for a simple, effective and pragmatic international certification scheme for rough diamonds,
	Welcoming, in this regard, the implementation of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme in such a way as not to impede the legitimate trade in diamonds or impose an undue burden on Governments or industry, particularly smaller producers, nor hinder the development of the diamond industry,
	Welcoming also the decision of forty-eight Kimberley Process Participants, representing seventy-four countries, including the twenty-seven members of the European Union represented by the European Commission, to address the problem of conflict diamonds by participating in the Process and implementing the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme,
	Welcoming further the desire of the Kimberley Process to systematize the current rules and procedures and the subsequent development of new rules and procedural norms regulating the activity of its working bodies, Participants and observers,
	Welcoming the successful consensual outcomes of the plenary meeting of the Kimberley Process hosted by the European Commission in Brussels from 5 to 8 November 2007,
	Welcoming also the important contributions made and that continue to be made by civil society and the diamond industry, in particular the World Diamond Council which represents all aspects of the diamond industry, to assist international efforts to stop the trade in conflict diamonds,
	Welcoming further the voluntary self-regulation initiatives for the diamond industry announced by the World Diamond Council, and recognizing that a system of such voluntary self-regulation contributes, as described in the Interlaken Declaration of 5 November 2002 on the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for Rough Diamonds,2 to ensuring the effectiveness of national systems of internal control for rough diamonds,
	Noting in this regard the Declaration on internal controls in diamond trading and manufacturing centres, endorsed by the Brussels plenary meeting,
	Noting with appreciation that the Kimberley Process has pursued its deliberations on an inclusive basis, involving concerned stakeholders, including producing, exporting and importing States, the diamond industry and civil society, as well as applicant States and international organizations,
	Recognizing that State sovereignty should be fully respected and that the principles of equality, mutual benefits and consensus should be adhered to,
	Recognizing also that the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which came into effect on 1 January 2003, will be credible only if all Participants have requisite national legislation coupled with effective and credible internal systems of control designed to eliminate the presence of conflict diamonds in the chain of producing, exporting and importing rough diamonds within their own territories, while taking into account that differences in production methods and trading practices, as well as differences in institutional controls thereof, may require different approaches to meeting minimum standards,
	1.	Reaffirms its strong and continuing support for the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme1 and the Kimberley Process as a whole;
	2.	Recognizes that the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme can help to ensure the effective implementation of relevant resolutions of the Security Council containing sanctions on the trade in conflict diamonds and act as a mechanism for the prevention of future conflicts, and calls for the full implementation of existing Council measures targeting the illicit trade in rough diamonds, particularly conflict diamonds which play a role in fuelling conflict;
	3.	Also recognizes the important contributions that the international efforts to address the problem of conflict diamonds, including the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, have made to the settlement of conflicts and the consolidation of peace in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia and Sierra Leone;
	4.	Notes the decision of the General Council of the World Trade Organization of 15 May 2003 granting a waiver with respect to the measures taken to implement the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, effective from 1 January 2003 to 31 December 2006,3 and the decision of the General Council of 17 November 2006 granting an extension of the waiver until 31 December 2012;4
	5.	Takes note with appreciation of the report of the Chair of the Kimberley Process submitted pursuant to resolution 61/28,5 and congratulates the participating Governments, the regional economic integration organization, the diamond industry and civil society organizations involved in the Process for contributing to the development, implementation and monitoring of the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, and recognizes, in particular, the progress made by Kimberley Process working groups, Participants and observers during 2007 in fulfilling the objectives set by the Chair to strengthen implementation of the peer review system, increase the transparency and accuracy of statistics, promote research into the traceability of diamonds, promote inclusiveness by broadening the level of involvement by both Governments and civil society in the Certification Scheme, foster a sense of ownership by Participants, improve information and communication flows and enhance the capacity of the Certification Scheme to respond to emerging challenges;
	6.	Stresses that the widest possible participation in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme is essential, and encourages all Member States to contribute to the work of the Kimberley Process by seeking membership, participating actively in the Certification Scheme and complying with its undertakings;
	7.	Welcomes the admission in 2007 of Liberia, Turkey and the Congo, and recognizes the increased involvement of civil society organizations, in particular those from producer countries, in the Kimberley Process;
	8.	Also welcomes the initiative announced in Brussels to address the issue of rough diamonds from Côte d'Ivoire by engaging all relevant stakeholders, including Côte d'Ivoire, to enhance the control and monitoring of the trade in rough diamonds in their territories, enhancing regional cooperation to strengthen compliance with the Kimberley Process, and supporting applicant countries in the West Africa region in their efforts to join the Process as called for in Security Council resolution 1643 (2005) of 15 December 2005;
	9.

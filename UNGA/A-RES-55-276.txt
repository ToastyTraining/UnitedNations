4.	Each round table shall be limited to a maximum of 71 participants, of whom approximately 66 will be heads of delegation of Member States and approximately five will be participants representing observers and entities of the United Nations system.
5.	Following the selection of the chairpersons of the round tables, each regional group should determine which of its members will participate in each round table, ensuring that equitable geographical distribution is maintained, allowing for some flexibility.

African States								18 Member States
Asian States								18 Member States
Eastern European States						8 Member States
Latin American and Caribbean States				12 Member States

7.	Member States that are not members of any of the regional groups may participate in a round table of their choice.
8.	For each round table, participants other than Member States, representing observers and entities of the United Nations system, will be selected by the President of the General Assembly, in consultation with Member States. In addition, the President of the Assembly, in consultation with the co-chairpersons of each round table and Member States, will choose, by 31 August 2001, two child delegates, taking into account equitable gender and geographical representation, who will each be permitted to present a brief introductory statement on the theme of the round tables in a language of their choice. 
9.	Each head of delegation attending a round table may be accompanied by two advisers. 
10.	The Holy See and Switzerland, in their capacity as observer States, and Palestine, in its capacity as observer, may also participate in different round tables, to be determined in consultation with the President of the General Assembly. 
11.	The co-chairpersons of each round table will be responsible for presenting orally their summary of the discussions during the concluding plenary meeting of the special session.
12.	The round tables shall be closed to the media and the general public. Accredited delegates and observers will be able to follow the proceedings of the round tables via a closed-circuit television in an overflow room.

	Welcoming the decision of many Member States to exchange and to publish information annually on their military budgets and to implement the guidelines and recommendations for objective information on military matters, as appropriate,


	Reaffirming its firm conviction that a better flow of objective information on military matters can help to relieve international tension and contribute to the building of confidence among States and to the conclusion of concrete disarmament agreements,

	Convinced that the end of the East-West confrontation and the resulting improvement of international relations form a sound basis for promoting further openness and transparency in all military matters,

	Recalling that the guidelines and recommendations for objective information on military matters recommended certain areas for further consideration, such as the improvement of the United Nations system for the standardized reporting of military expenditures,

	1.	Recommends the guidelines and recommendations for objective information on military matters to all Member States for implementation, fully taking into account specific political, military and other conditions prevailing in a region, on the basis of initiatives and with the agreement of the States of the region concerned;

	2.	Calls upon all Member States to report annually, by 30 April, to the Secretary-General, their military expenditures for the latest fiscal year for which data are available, using, for the time being, the reporting instrument as recommended in its resolution 35/142 B;

	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to circulate annually the reports on military expenditures, as received from Member States;

	4.	Also requests the Secretary-General to seek the views of Member States on ways and means to implement the guidelines and recommendations for objective information on military matters, including, in particular, how to strengthen and broaden participation in the United Nations system for the standardized reporting of military expenditures, and to submit a report on the subject to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session;

	5.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-first session the item entitled "Objective information on military matters, including transparency of military expenditures".

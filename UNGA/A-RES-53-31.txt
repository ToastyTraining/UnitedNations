	Recalling its resolution 49/30 of 7 December 1994 in which it recognized the importance of the Managua Declaration4 and Plan of Action5 adopted by the Second International Conference of New or Restored Democracies in July 1994, as well as its resolutions 50/133 of 20 December 1995, 51/31 of 6 December 1996 and 52/18 of 21 November 1997,

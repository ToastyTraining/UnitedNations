	The General Assembly,
	Guided by the purposes, principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations,
	Guided also by the principles and norms of international humanitarian law, in particular the Geneva Conventions of 12 August 19491 and the Additional Protocols thereto, of 1977,2 as well as international standards of human rights, in particular the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,3 the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,4 the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,4 the Convention on the Rights of the Child5 and the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993,6

	Noting with deep concern that armed conflicts are continuing in various parts of the world, often resulting in serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law,
	Recognizing that great technological progress has been achieved in the field of DNA forensic sciences with regard to missing persons, such as the work done by the International Commission on Missing Persons, based in Sarajevo, which could significantly assist efforts to identify missing persons from other conflict areas in the world,

	4.	Calls upon States which are parties to an armed conflict to take immediate steps to determine the identity and fate of persons reported missing in connection with the armed conflict;
	5.	Requests States to pay the utmost attention to cases of children reported missing in connection with armed conflicts and to take appropriate measures to search for and identify those children;
	6.	Invites States which are parties to an armed conflict to cooperate fully with the International Committee of the Red Cross in establishing the fate of missing persons and to adopt a comprehensive approach to this issue, including all practical and coordination mechanisms that may be necessary, based on humanitarian considerations only;
	7.	Urges States and encourages intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations to take all necessary measures at the national, regional and international levels to address the problem of persons reported missing in connection with armed conflicts and to provide appropriate assistance as requested by the States concerned;
	8.	Invites all relevant human rights mechanisms and procedures, as appropriate, to address the problem of persons reported missing in connection with armed conflicts in their forthcoming reports to the General Assembly;
	9.	Requests the Secretary-General to bring the present resolution to the attention of all Governments, the competent United Nations bodies, the specialized agencies, regional intergovernmental organizations and international humanitarian organizations;

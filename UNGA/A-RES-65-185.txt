	Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration3 and the development goals contained therein, as well as the commitments made at major United Nations summits, conferences and special sessions, including the commitments made at the 2005 World Summit4 and at the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals,5
	Recalling also its resolution 57/270 B of 23 June 2003 on the integrated and coordinated implementation of and follow-up to the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic and social fields,

	Noting with appreciation the ministerial declaration adopted at the high-level segment of the substantive session of 2006 of the Economic and Social Council, entitled "Creating an environment at the national and international levels conducive to generating full and productive employment and decent work for all, and its impact on sustainable development",6
	Noting that the decent work agenda of the International Labour Organization, with its four strategic objectives, has an important role to play, as reaffirmed in the International Labour Organization Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization7 and in the Global Jobs Pact, in achieving the objective of full and productive employment and decent work for all, including its objective of social protection,
	Emphasizing the need to enhance the role of the Commission for Social Development in the follow-up to and review of the World Summit for Social Development and the outcome of the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly,
	Recognizing that a people-centred approach must be at the centre of economic and social development,
	Expressing deep concern that attainment of the social development objectives may be hindered by the global financial and economic crisis, as well as challenges brought about by the food and energy crises,
	Recognizing the complex character of the current global food crisis and ongoing food insecurity as a combination of several major factors, both structural and conjunctural, which is also negatively affected by, inter alia, environmental degradation, drought and desertification, global climate change, natural disasters and the lack of the necessary technology, and recognizing also that a strong commitment from national Governments and the international community as a whole is required to confront the major threats to food security and to ensure that policies in the area of agriculture do not distort trade and worsen the food crisis,
	Affirming its strong support for fair globalization and the need to translate growth into eradication of poverty and commitment to strategies and policies that aim to promote full, freely chosen and productive employment and decent work for all and that these should constitute a fundamental component of relevant national and international policies as well as national development strategies, including poverty reduction strategies, and reaffirming that employment creation and decent work should be incorporated into macroeconomic policies, taking fully into account the impact and social dimension of globalization, the benefits and costs of which are often unevenly shared and distributed, 
	Recognizing that social inclusion is a means for achieving social integration and is crucial for fostering stable, safe, harmonious, peaceful and just societies and for improving social cohesion so as to create an environment for development and progress, 
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;8
	2.	Welcomes the reaffirmation by Governments of their will and commitment to continue implementing the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development and the Programme of Action,1 in particular to eradicate poverty, promote full and productive employment and foster social integration to achieve stable, safe and just societies for all; 
	3.	Recognizes that the implementation of the Copenhagen commitments and the attainment of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, are mutually reinforcing and that the Copenhagen commitments are crucial to a coherent people-centred approach to development; 
	4.	Reaffirms that the Commission for Social Development continues to have the primary responsibility for the follow-up to and review of the World Summit for Social Development and the outcome of the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly and that it serves as the main United Nations forum for an intensified global dialogue on social development issues, and calls upon Member States, the relevant specialized agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system and civil society to enhance their support for its work;
	5.	Expresses deep concern that the world financial and economic crisis, the world food and energy crises, continuing food insecurity and climate change, as well as the lack of results so far in the multilateral trade negotiations and a loss of confidence in the international economic system, have negative implications for social development, in particular for the achievement of poverty eradication, full and productive employment and decent work for all and social integration; 
	6.	Stresses the importance of the policy space of national Governments, in particular in the areas of social expenditure and social protection programmes, and calls upon international financial institutions and donors to support developing countries in achieving their social development, in line with their national priorities and strategies by, among other things, providing debt relief; 
	7.	Recognizes that poverty eradication, full and productive employment and decent work for all and social integration are interrelated and mutually reinforcing, and that an enabling environment therefore needs to be created so that all three objectives can be pursued simultaneously; 
	8.	Also recognizes that the broad concept of social development affirmed by the World Summit for Social Development and the twenty-fourth special session of the General Assembly has been weakened in national and international policymaking and that, while poverty eradication is a central part of development policy and discourse, further attention should be given to the other commitments agreed to at the Summit, in particular those concerning employment and social integration, which have also suffered from a general disconnect between economic and social policymaking; 
	9.	Acknowledges that the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006), launched after the World Summit for Social Development, has provided the long-term vision for sustained and concerted efforts at the national and international levels to eradicate poverty; 
	10.	Recognizes that the implementation of the commitments made by Governments during the first Decade has fallen short of expectations, and welcomes the proclamation of the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2008-2017) by the General Assembly in its resolution 62/205 of 19 December 2007 in order to support, in an efficient and coordinated manner, the internationally agreed development goals related to poverty eradication, including the Millennium Development Goals; 
	11.	Emphasizes that the major United Nations conferences and summits, including the Millennium Summit, the 2005 World Summit, the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals and the International Conference on Financing for Development, in its Monterrey Consensus,9 have reinforced the priority and urgency of poverty eradication within the United Nations development agenda; 
	12.	Also emphasizes that poverty eradication policies should attack poverty by addressing its root and structural causes and manifestations, and that equity and the reduction of inequalities need to be incorporated in those policies; 
	13.	Stresses that an enabling environment is a critical precondition for achieving equity and social development and that, while economic growth is essential, entrenched inequality and marginalization are an obstacle to the broad-based and sustained growth required for sustainable, inclusive and people-centred development, and recognizes the need to balance and ensure complementarity between measures to achieve growth and measures to achieve economic and social equity in order for there to be an impact on overall poverty levels; 
	14.	Also stresses that stability in global financial systems and corporate social responsibility and accountability, as well as national economic policies that have an impact on other stakeholders, are essential in creating an enabling international environment to promote economic growth and social development; 
	15.	Recognizes the need to promote respect for all human rights and fundamental freedoms in order to address the most pressing social needs of people living in poverty, including through the design and development of appropriate mechanisms to strengthen and consolidate democratic institutions and governance;
	16.	Reaffirms the commitment to the empowerment of women and gender equality, as well as to the mainstreaming of a gender perspective into all development efforts, recognizing that these are critical for achieving sustainable development and for efforts to combat hunger, poverty and disease and to strengthen policies and programmes that improve, ensure and broaden the full participation of women in all spheres of political, economic, social and cultural life, as equal partners, and to improve their access to all resources needed for the full exercise of all their human rights and fundamental freedoms by removing persistent barriers, including ensuring equal access to full and productive employment and decent work, as well as strengthening their economic independence; 
	17.	Stresses, further, that effective participation of people in civic, social, economic and political activities is essential in order to achieve the eradication of poverty and the promotion of social inclusion; in this regard, Governments should increase participation of citizens and communities in the planning and implementation of social integration policies and strategies aimed at achieving poverty eradication, social integration and full employment and decent work for all; 
	18.	Reaffirms the commitment to promote opportunities for full, freely chosen and productive employment, including for the most disadvantaged, as well as decent work for all, in order to deliver social justice combined with economic efficiency, with full respect for fundamental principles and rights at work under conditions of equity, equality, security and dignity, and further reaffirms that macroeconomic policies should, inter alia, support employment creation, taking fully into account the social impact and dimension of globalization; 
	19.	Notes with interest the adoption by the International Labour Conference on 10 June 2008 of the International Labour Organization Declaration on Social Justice for a Fair Globalization,7 which acknowledges the particular role of the Organization in promoting a fair globalization and its responsibility to assist its members in their efforts, and the adoption by the International Labour Conference on 19 June 2009 of the Global Jobs Pact; 
	20.	Reaffirms that there is an urgent need to create an environment at the national and international levels that is conducive to the attainment of full and productive employment and decent work for all as a foundation for sustainable development and that an environment that supports investment, growth and entrepreneurship is essential to the creation of new job opportunities, and also reaffirms that opportunities for men and women to obtain productive work in conditions of freedom, equity, security and human dignity are essential to ensuring the eradication of hunger and poverty, the improvement of economic and social well-being for all, the achievement of sustained economic growth and sustainable development of all nations and a fully inclusive and equitable globalization; 
	21.	Stresses the importance of removing obstacles to the realization of the right of peoples to self-determination, in particular of peoples living under colonial or other forms of alien domination or foreign occupation, which adversely affect their social and economic development, including their exclusion from labour markets; 
	22.	Reaffirms the need to address all forms of violence in its many manifestations, including domestic violence, particularly against women, children, older persons and persons with disabilities, and discrimination, including xenophobia, recognizing that violence increases challenges to States and societies in the achievement of poverty eradication, full and productive employment and decent work for all and social integration, and further recognizes that terrorism, trafficking in arms, organized crime, trafficking in persons, money-laundering, ethnic and religious conflict, civil war, politically motivated killing and genocide present fundamental threats to societies and pose increasing challenges to States and societies in the attainment of conditions conducive to social development, and that they further present urgent and compelling reasons for action by Governments individually and, as appropriate, jointly to foster social cohesion while recognizing, protecting and valuing diversity; 
	23.	Calls upon the organizations of the United Nations system to commit to mainstreaming the goal of full and productive employment and decent work for all in their policies, programmes and activities; 
	24.	Requests the United Nations funds, programmes and agencies, and invites financial institutions, to support efforts to mainstream the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all in their policies, programmes and activities;
	25.	Recognizes that promoting full employment and decent work also requires investing in education, training and skills development for women and men, and girls and boys, strengthening social protection and health systems and applying international labour standards; 
	26.	Also recognizes that full and productive employment and decent work for all, which encompass social protection, fundamental principles and rights at work, tripartism and social dialogue, are key elements of sustainable development for all countries and are therefore a priority objective of international cooperation;

Stresses that policies and strategies to achieve full employment and decent work for all should include specific measures to promote gender equality and foster social integration for social groups such as young people, persons with disabilities and older persons, as well as migrants and indigenous peoples, on an equal basis with others;
	28.	Also stresses the need to allocate adequate resources for the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women in the workplace, including unequal access to labour market participation and wage inequalities, as well as reconciliation of work and private life for both women and men; 
	29.	Reaffirms its resolution 64/134 of 18 December 2009 proclaiming the year commencing on 12 August 2010 the International Year of Youth: Dialogue and Mutual Understanding, and calls upon all Member States and other relevant stakeholders, including civil society, the private sector and international cooperation agencies, to support activities at the national, regional and international levels aimed at promoting the ideals of peace, freedom, progress and solidarity among young people in order to ensure social cohesion and youth development; 
	30.	Encourages States to design and implement strategies and policies for the creation of full and productive employment that is appropriately and adequately remunerated, and for the reduction of unemployment, and further encourages States to promote youth employment by, inter alia, developing and implementing policies and strategies in collaboration with relevant stakeholders; 
	31.	Also encourages States to pursue efforts to promote the concerns of older persons and persons with disabilities and their organizations in the planning, implementation and evaluation of all development programmes and policies;
	32.	Stresses that policies and programmes designed to achieve poverty eradication, full employment and decent work for all should include specific measures to foster social integration, including by providing marginalized socio-economic sectors and groups with equal access to opportunities and social protection;

Acknowledges the important nexus between international migration and social development, and stresses the importance of enforcing labour law effectively with regard to migrant workers' labour relations and working conditions, inter alia, those related to their remuneration and conditions of health, safety at work and the right to freedom of association;

	35.	Stresses that the benefits of economic growth should be distributed more equitably and that, in order to close the gap of inequality and avoid any further deepening of inequality, comprehensive social policies and programmes, including appropriate social transfer and job creation programmes and social protection systems, are needed;
	36.	Recognizes the importance of providing social protection schemes for the formal and informal economy as instruments to achieve equity, inclusion and stability and cohesion of societies, and emphasizes the importance of supporting national efforts aimed at bringing informal workers into the formal economy; 
	37.

	46.	Recognizes that priority should be given to agricultural and non-farm sectors and that steps should be taken to anticipate and offset the negative social and economic consequences of globalization and to maximize its benefits for poor people living and working in rural areas, while paying special attention to the development of microenterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly in rural areas, as well as subsistence economies, to secure their safe interaction with larger economies;

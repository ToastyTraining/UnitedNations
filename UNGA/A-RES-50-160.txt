	Expressing serious concern about the limited progress made so far in the implementation of the New Agenda and the continuing deterioration of the economic and social situation in Africa, 

	Mindful of the urgent need for African countries to increase and mobilize internal resources for the implementation of the New Agenda through, inter alia, policies for the promotion of domestic savings, improved and accessible banking facilities and further improvements in traditional practices of capital formation at local levels, as well as to continue creating an enabling environment for domestic and foreign investment,

	6.

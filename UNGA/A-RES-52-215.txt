	(c)	Conversion rates as recommended by the Committee on Contributions;1

	(e)	A low per capita income adjustment, with a per capita income limit of the average world per capita income for the statistical base period and a gradient of 80 per cent;

	(f)	A minimum assessment rate of 0.001 per cent;

	(g)	A ceiling rate of 25 per cent;

	(h)	Individual rates of assessment for the least developed countries not to exceed the current level of 0.01 per cent;

	(i) The phasing out of the scheme of limits in accordance with General Assembly resolution 48/223 B of 23 December 1993;

	(j)	In phasing out the scheme of limits before the year 2001, the allocation of additional points resulting therefrom to developing countries benefiting from its application limited to 15 per cent of the effect of the phase-out;

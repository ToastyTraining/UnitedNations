	Taking into account the crucial role the Year could play, inter alia, in raising public awareness of the importance for sustainable development of the Earth's processes and resources; disaster prevention, reduction and mitigation; and capacity-building for the sustainable management of resources; and its important contribution to the United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development,

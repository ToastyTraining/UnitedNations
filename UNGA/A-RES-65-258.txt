	Noting that the workload of the President of the International Court of Justice and that of the Vice-President, when acting as President, have increased since 1987 and that the amounts of the special allowance of the President and of the Vice-President, when acting as President, have not increased since then,

Decides to review at its sixty-sixth session the pension schemes for the members of the International Court of Justice and the judges of the International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and requests the Secretary-General to include in his report a proposal for a mechanism that he may use to determine retirement pension benefits, taking into account acquired pension benefit rights accrued prior to serving in the Court or the Tribunals;

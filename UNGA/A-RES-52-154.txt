	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/52/647)]


52/154.Action dedicated to the 1999 centennial of the first International Peace Conference and to the closing of the United Nations Decade of International Law

 
	The General Assembly,

	Reaffirming once again the commitment of the United Nations and its Member States, as well as the States parties to the Statute of the International Court of Justice, to the goals of the United Nations Decade of International Law, expressed by the General Assembly in resolutions under that item of its agenda,1

	Mindful of the long and well-established tradition of progressive development and codification of international law, marked by the first and the second International Peace Conference, held at The Hague in 1899 and 1907 respectively,

	Recalling that a third international peace conference, scheduled to be held at The Hague in 1915, was not held because of the outbreak of the First World War the previous year,

	Recalling also the proposal by the Russian Federation for a third international peace conference with a view to considering international law and order in the post-cold-war world at the threshold of the twenty-first century, referred to in General Assembly resolution 51/159 of 16 December 1996, and the initiatives undertaken by the Kingdom of the Netherlands with regard to the commemoration of the first International Peace Conference,

	Recalling further that in resolution 51/159 the General Assembly invited the Governments of the Russian Federation and the Netherlands to arrange, as a matter of urgency, a preliminary discussion with other interested Member States on the substantive content of action to be taken in 1999 and to seek, in that respect, the cooperation of the International Court of Justice, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, relevant intergovernmental organizations, as well as other relevant organizations,


	Noting, in this respect, that a meeting of the "Friends of 1999" was held on 22 April 1997 at the Peace Palace, The Hague, to which representatives of twenty States from all regions of the world, the International Court of Justice, the Permanent Court of Arbitration, the International Committee of the Red Cross and the coalition of non-governmental organizations, The Hague Appeal for Peace, were invited for consultations on proposals for a draft programme of action for the centennial of the first International Peace Conference,

	Noting with satisfaction that the realization of all those proposals in the programme of action dedicated to the centennial of the first International Peace Conference, presented by the Netherlands and the Russian Federation,2 is consistent with the goals of the United Nations Decade of International Law,

	Noting also that the programme of action, inter alia, calls for the presentation of the results of the centennial discussions to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session, at the closing of the United Nations Decade of International Law,

	Noting further that the programme of action does not entail budgetary implications for the United Nations,

	1.	Welcomes the programme of action dedicated to the centennial of the first International Peace Conference, presented by the Governments of the Netherlands and the Russian Federation,2 which aims at contributing to the further development of the themes of the first and the second International Peace Conference and could be regarded as a third international peace conference;

	2.	Encourages:

	(a)	The Governments of the Netherlands and the Russian Federation to proceed with the implementation of the programme of action;

	(b)	All States to participate in the activities set out in the programme of action, as well as to initiate such activities and to coordinate their efforts in this respect at the global level, as well as at the regional and national levels;

	(c)	All States to take appropriate measures to ensure universal participation in the activities pursuant to the programme of action, with special consideration for the participation of representatives of the least developed countries;

	3.	Encourages the competent United Nations organs, subsidiary organs, programmes and specialized agencies, including the International Court of Justice, the International Law Commission and the Secretariat, within their respective mandates, competencies and budgets, as well as other international organizations:

	(a)	To cooperate in the implementation of the programme of action and to coordinate their efforts in this respect;

	(b)	To consider participation in the activities envisaged in the programme of action;

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to ensure consistency of the activities of the Organization relating to the closing of the United Nations Decade of International Law with the programme of action and to direct his efforts accordingly;



	5.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-third session, under the item entitled "United Nations Decade of International Law", a sub-item entitled "Progress in the action dedicated to the 1999 centennial of the first International Peace Conference and to the closing of the United Nations Decade of International Law".

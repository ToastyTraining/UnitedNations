	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Protection Force 1/ and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/ 

	Bearing in mind Security Council resolutions 727 (1992) of 8 January 1992 and 740 (1992) of 7 February 1992, in which the Council endorsed the sending of a group of military liaison officers to Yugoslavia to promote maintenance of the cease-fire,

	Bearing in mind also Security Council resolution 743 (1992) of 21 February 1992, by which the Council established the United Nations Protection Force, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Force, the latest of which was resolution 871 (1993)
of 4 October 1993,

	Recalling its resolutions 46/233 of 19 March 1992 and 47/210 B of 14 September 1993 on the financing of the Force,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Force are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

__________

	1/	A/48/690 and Corr.1-3.

	2/	A/48/878.

	Recalling its previous decision regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Force, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Force by certain Governments,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Force with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Expresses concern about the deteriorating financial situation with regard to peace-keeping activities due to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments, particularly Member States in arrears;

	2.	Expresses deep concern about the adverse effect that the deteriorating financial situation has on reimbursement to troop contributors, placing an additional burden on these countries and putting at risk the continuing supply of troops to the United Nations Protection Force, and, consequently, the effective implementation of the its mandate;

	3.	Reaffirms its resolution 48/227 of 23 December 1993 and stresses the need for the Secretariat to submit budget documents in time in order to allow for a proper and thorough review and approval by the General Assembly of the budgets before their implementation;

	4.	Regrets deeply the fact that the budget documents did not comply with General Assembly resolution 42/207 C of 11 December 1987 as regards the equal treatment of the official languages of the United Nations;
	
	5.	Notes the assurances given by the Secretariat that such a situation will not be repeated;

	6.	Notes with satisfaction an improvement in the compliance by the Secretariat with certain resolutions of the General Assembly concerning the form of budget documents with regard to peace-keeping operations;

	7.	Reaffirms the importance of the role of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions as an advisory body to the General Assembly in the budget process;

	8.	Urges the Secretary-General to complete his review of the rates of reimbursement to Governments in respect of contingent-owned equipment in close consultation with Member States, in particular with troop-contributing countries, and to submit his proposals to the General Assembly no later than at its forty-ninth session;

	9.	Endorses the observations and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee, 2/ subject to the provisions of the present resolution;

	10.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Force is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy and, in particular, to implement fully economy, financial and efficiency measures to be approved during the resumed forty-eighth session but no later than 1 May 1994, and to report on the implementation of such measures in the context of the performance report relevant to the period;

	11.	Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Force promptly and in full;

	12.	Affirms that the non- and late payment of assessed contributions in full and on time and the fact that the General Assembly has to consider and approve budgets for peace-keeping operations without adequate documentation have damaged and continue to damage the ability of peace-keeping operations to implement their activities effectively;

	13.	Also affirms that it expects that the Secretariat will make appropriate arrangements to ensure that the General Assembly is not asked to take any future decisions on budgets for peace-keeping operations retroactively;

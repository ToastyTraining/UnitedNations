Resolution adopted by the General Assembly on 17 December 2003
[without reference to a Main Committee (A/58/L.45 and Add.1)]
		58/120.	Special emergency economic assistance for the recovery and the development of the Comoros


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 51/30 F of 13 December 1996 and 53/1 F of 16 November 1998 on special emergency economic assistance to the Comoros,
	Noting that since 1995, the Comoros has been subjected to several major events, including a secessionist conflict, which created serious political instability and caused economic and social trauma,
	Considering that the unfavourable and insular situation of the Comoros, which is among the least developed countries, the decline in the gross domestic product of the country caused by the fall in the prices of its export products, the poverty of its soil, the scarcity of its natural resources and the diminutive size of its domestic market have adverse economic consequences and increase the impoverishment of the population,
	Aware of the efforts made by the Government of the Comoros to assist the most affected and deprived sectors of the population and to reallocate to that end, as a matter of great urgency, the major part of the budget required for the functioning of the State,
	1.	Welcomes the signing of the Fomboni Agreement of February 2001, which created prospects for a peaceful resolution of the separatist crisis;
	2.	Reaffirms its support for South Africa, the African Union, the International Organization of la Francophonie and other countries of the region in the mediation efforts to resolve the Comorian crisis;
	3.	Welcomes the recommendations contained in the statement signed by the Friends of the Comoros in Paris on 29 October 2003 and the declaration of the Indian Ocean Commission issued in Moroni on 30 October 2003;
	4.	Urges the Government of the Comoros and the governments of the autonomous islands to pursue the efforts under way, to accelerate the organization of legislative elections and to establish the remaining national institutions as stipulated by the Constitution;
	5.	Reaffirms that the primary responsibility for the well-being of the people and the development of the economy rests firmly with the Government of the Comoros and the governments of the autonomous islands;
	6.	Expresses its appreciation to all States and to all the international organizations concerned, including United Nations bodies and specialized agencies, for the assistance they have provided for the relief of the Comoros;
	7.	Stresses that the financial resources available remain nonetheless insufficient vis-à-vis the most basic needs for ensuring the humanitarian, economic and political recovery of the country;
	8.	Requests Member States, international organizations and other relevant organizations of the United Nations system, in the event of an agreement between the Comoros and the authorities of the autonomous islands, and while awaiting the finalization of the Fomboni Agreement by early 2004, to direct their financial and technical assistance towards assisting the most affected sectors of the population during and after the transition period, achieving reconstruction and sustainable development and enabling the country to re-engage with the international financial institutions;
	9.	Requests the Secretary-General to make efforts to mobilize Member States, relevant United Nations specialized agencies and other organizations in order to provide the Comoros with necessary financial, economic and technical assistance, particularly in debt forgiveness, in order to enable it to fully implement the Fomboni Agreement, particularly to organize legislative elections;
	10.	Also requests the Secretary-General, in collaboration with all relevant United Nations departments and specialized agencies, as well as international organizations already working in the Comoros, to gather relevant information and assess the needs of the country and the possible assistance from the international community;
	11.	Further requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-ninth session on the implementation of the present resolution.

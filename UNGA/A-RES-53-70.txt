	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the First Committee (A/53/576)]


53/70.Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolutions on the role of science and technology in the context of international security, in which, inter alia, it recognized that scientific and technological developments could have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needed to be maintained and encouraged,

	Noting that considerable progress has been achieved in developing and applying the latest information technologies and means of telecommunication,

	Affirming that it sees in this process the broadest positive opportunities for the further development of civilization, the expansion of opportunities for cooperation for the common good of all States, the enhancement of the creative potential of mankind, and additional improvements in the circulation of information in the global community,

	Recalling in this connection the approaches and principles outlined at the Information Society and Development Conference, held at Midrand, South Africa, from 13 to 15 May 1996,

	Taking note of the results of the Ministerial Conference on Terrorism, held in Paris on 30 July 1996, and of the recommendations it made,1

	Noting that the dissemination and use of information technologies and means affect the interests of the entire international community and that optimum effectiveness is enhanced by broad international cooperation,

	Expressing concern that these technologies and means can potentially be used for purposes that are inconsistent with the objectives of maintaining international stability and security and may adversely affect the security of States,

	Considering that it is necessary to prevent the misuse or exploitation of information resources or technologies for criminal or terrorist purposes,

	1.	Calls upon Member States to promote at multilateral levels the consideration of existing and potential threats in the field of information security;

	2.	Invites all Member States to inform the Secretary-General of their views and assessments on the following questions:

	(a)	General appreciation of the issues of information security;

	(b)	Definition of basic notions related to information security, including unauthorized interference with or misuse of information and telecommunications systems and information resources;

	(c)	Advisability of developing international principles that would enhance the security of global information and telecommunications systems and help to combat information terrorism and criminality;

	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit a report to the General Assembly at its fifty-fourth session;

	4.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-fourth session an item entitled "Developments in the field of information and telecommunications in the context of international security".

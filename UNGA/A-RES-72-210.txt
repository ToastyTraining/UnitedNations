	72/210.	International Year of Camelids, 2024


	The General Assembly,
	Noting that camelids are strictly herbivorous, even-toed ungulate mammals that first appeared in America 45 million years ago,
	Noting also that there are six living species of camelids, namely, dromedary camels, Bactrian camels, llamas, alpacas, vicuñas and guanacos, in North Africa, South-West and Central Asia, Oceania and South America,
	Noting further that camelids constitute the main means of subsistence for millions of poor families that live in the most hostile ecosystems on the planet, and that they contribute to the fight against hunger, the eradication of extreme poverty, the empowerment of women and the sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems,
	Recognizing that comprehensive management of the products derived from camelids would promote the inclusion of the most vulnerable populations of rural societies, leading to the creation of sustainable jobs and promoting equality, and further recognizing that these species are an important element of the cultural and spiritual identity of ancestral indigenous peoples, constituting an important social basis of the traditional and contemporary knowledge of these peoples who have maintained, preserved and protected genetic biodiversity,
	Noting that camelids are a main source of protein, fibre for clothes and fertilizer for agricultural production, and that they serve as pack animals, transporting people and products in indigenous communities throughout South America's extensive Andean highlands, as well as in deserts in Africa and Asia,
	Noting also that camelids can play a key role in addressing the effects of climate change, in particular in arid and semi-arid lands, and that recognition, advocacy and support for the promotion of the products and services that they provide is of paramount importance for the livelihoods of the communities that depend on them,
	Recalling the urgent need to raise public awareness of the importance of camelids for food security and ecosystem functions, and to promote actions that improve the management of camelids in order to contribute to the Sustainable Development Goals,
	Taking note of resolution 7/2017 of 7 July 2017 on the International Year of the Camelids, adopted at the fortieth session of the Conference of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, held in Rome from 3 to 8 July 2017,1
	Reaffirming its resolutions 53/199 of 15 December 1998 and 61/185 of 20 December 2006 on the proclamation of international years, and Economic and Social Council resolution 1980/67 of 25 July 1980 on international years and anniversaries, in particular paragraphs 1 to 10 of the annex thereto on the agreed criteria for the proclamation of international years, as well as paragraphs 13 and 14 of the annex, stating that an international year should not be proclaimed before the basic arrangements necessary for its organization and financing have been made,
	1.	Decides to declare 2024 the International Year of Camelids;
	2.	Encourages all Member States, the United Nations system and all other actors to take advantage of the International Year to promote awareness among the public of the economic and cultural importance of camelids and to foster the consumption of the goods produced from these mammals, including edible goods, in order to contribute to the eradication of hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition;
	3.	Invites the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, mindful of provisions contained in the annex to Economic and Social Council resolution 1980/67, to facilitate the organization and implementation of the International Year, in collaboration with Governments, relevant organizations of the United Nations system, international and regional organizations and all other relevant stakeholders;
	4.	Requests the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, mindful of the provisions of paragraphs 23 to 27 of the annex to Economic and Social Council resolution 1980/67, to inform the General Assembly at its eightieth session regarding the implementation of the present resolution, including an evaluation of the International Year;
	5.	Stresses that the costs of all the activities that may arise from the implementation of the present resolution and that are above and beyond those currently within the mandate of the lead agency should be met through voluntary contributions, including from the private sector;
	6.	Invites all relevant stakeholders to make voluntary contributions and to provide other forms of support for the International Year.

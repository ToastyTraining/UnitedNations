	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Third Committee (A/52/644/Add.3)]


52/146.Situation of human rights in Rwanda


	The General Assembly,

	Guided by the Charter of the United Nations, the International Bill of Human Rights,1 the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide2 and other applicable human rights and humanitarian law standards,

	Recalling its resolution 51/114 of 12 December 1996 and relevant previous resolutions, and taking note of Commission on Human Rights resolution 1997/66 of 16 April 1997,3

	Reaffirming that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall Rwandan and United Nations responses to the situation in Rwanda and that a strengthened human rights component is indispensable to national reconciliation and reconstruction in Rwanda,


	1.	Takes note of the reports of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights on the Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda4 and the report of the Special Representative of the Commission on Human Rights on the situation of human rights in Rwanda;5

	2.	Reiterates its strong condemnation of the crime of genocide and the crimes against humanity which were perpetrated in Rwanda in 1994, and expresses its concern at the continuation of human rights violations and violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda;

	3.	Urges all States to cooperate fully, without delay, with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other Serious Violations of International Humanitarian Law Committed in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan Citizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such Violations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring States between 1 January and 31 December 1994, taking into account the obligations set forth in Security Council resolutions 955 (1994) of 8 November 1994 and 978 (1995) of 27 February 1995, and encourages the Secretary-General to facilitate the activities of the International Criminal Tribunal to the greatest extent possible;

	4.	Notes with interest the recommendations made in the report of the Special Representative, in particular the recommendation that there is a need for greater coordination in the provision of human rights technical assistance;

	5.	Notes the commitment of the Government of Rwanda to investigate reports of extrajudicial executions committed by some members of the security forces, and calls upon the competent national authorities to conduct those investigations promptly and with all due rigour;

	6.	Welcomes the start of the trials of those suspected of genocide and crimes against humanity in Rwanda and the improvements that have been made in the trial process, and stresses the need for continued efforts by the Government of Rwanda to further strengthen fair trial guarantees and to ensure access to legal representation, which are of particular importance given that those found guilty may face the death penalty;

	7.	Affirms the urgent need to complete a dossier for every detainee, with a view to identifying those who should be released immediately, early or conditionally, and the need for continued efforts by the Government of Rwanda, with the assistance of the international community, to bring about further improvements in conditions of detention;

	Recalling the recommendation of the Working Group at its extraordinary meeting in June 2009 that the General Assembly review, at its next session, the basis for its decision in resolution 3331 B (XXIX) to provide funding to the Agency for international posts so as to enable the Agency to meet contemporary demands from stakeholders and the Assembly itself,3
	Stressing the need to continue supporting the institutional strengthening of the Agency, including the need to reinforce the Agency's resource mobilization and advocacy capacities as well as the need for more predictable funding, through the provision of financial resources from the regular budget of the United Nations, in accordance with the requests made in its resolutions 64/89 of 10 December 2009 and 65/100 of 10 December 2010,

	6.	Reiterates its appeal to all States, the specialized agencies and non-governmental organizations to continue and to increase their contributions to the Agency in order to address the serious financial constraints and underfunding, especially with respect to the deficit in the Agency's General Fund, and to support the Agency's valuable and necessary work in assisting the Palestine refugees in all fields of operation; 
	7.	Urges the Commissioner-General to continue his efforts to sustain and increase the support of traditional donors and to enhance income from non-traditional donors, including through partnerships with public and private entities;

	Emphasizing the need to strengthen further the political will to ensure the political, financial, technical and other support critical for the effective implementation of the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General not only in the two thematic areas - education and conflict prevention and post-conflict peace-building - of the deliberations of the Working Group in 2001, but also in all the areas mentioned in the report,
	Welcoming the adoption by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of the Organization of African Unity at its thirty-seventh ordinary session, held at Lusaka from 9 to 11 July 2001, of the New African Initiative (now called New Partnership for Africa's Development),5

	10.	Also requests that the task force provide Member States, on an annual basis, with updated matrices indicating the current status of implementation of the various recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General.

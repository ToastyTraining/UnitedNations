	Recalling further its resolution 59/137 of 10 December 2004, in which it requested the Secretary-General to encourage relevant agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system to continue to work with the Government of Rwanda to develop and implement programmes aimed at supporting vulnerable groups that continue to suffer from the effects of the 1994 genocide,

	Recognizing the numerous difficulties faced by survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, particularly the orphans, widows and victims of sexual violence, who are poorer and more vulnerable as a result of the genocide, especially the many victims of sexual violence who have contracted HIV and have since either died or become seriously ill with AIDS,
	Commending the significant efforts of the Government and people of Rwanda and civil society organizations, as well as international efforts, to provide support for restoring the dignity of the survivors, including the allocation by the Government of Rwanda of 5 per cent of its national budget every year to support genocide survivors, 
	Recalling Security Council resolution 1966 (2010) of 22 December 2010, in which the Council requested the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda to take all possible measures to expeditiously complete all its remaining work no later than 31 December 2014, to prepare its closure and to ensure a smooth transition to the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals,
	Firmly convinced of the necessity of restoring the dignity of the survivors of the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, which would help to promote reconciliation and healing in Rwanda,
	Welcoming the report of the Secretary-General,4
	1.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to encourage the relevant agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system to implement resolution 59/137 expeditiously, inter alia, by providing assistance in the areas of education for orphans, medical care and treatment for victims of sexual violence, including HIV-positive victims, trauma and psychological counselling, and skills training and microcredit programmes aimed at promoting self-sufficiency and alleviating poverty;
	2.	Calls upon Member States and the United Nations system to urgently implement the recommendations contained in the report of the Secretary-General;4
	3.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue the activities of the programme of outreach entitled "The Rwanda Genocide and the United Nations" aimed at Rwanda genocide victim remembrance and education, in order to help to prevent future acts of genocide;

	5.	Welcomes the adoption of Security Council resolution 1966 (2010), in which the Council decided to establish the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals and, in this regard, calls upon the Mechanism to conclude the remaining cases within the initial period set out in resolution 1966 (2010), and calls upon Member States to support that effort;
	6.	Requests the Secretary-General, in consultation with the Government of Rwanda, to continue to encourage the relevant agencies, funds and programmes of the United Nations system to take appropriate steps to support, in particular, efforts to enhance judicial capacity-building and victim support in Rwanda;

	22.	Stresses that the creation of a gender adviser in the Best Practices Unit of the Department of Peacekeeping Operations does not constitute a precedent to be followed by other departments and should not itself lead to the establishment of a gender unit in the Department, and also stresses the importance of not duplicating functions and capacities that already exist elsewhere in the Secretariat;

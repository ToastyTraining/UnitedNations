Resolution adopted by the General Assembly
[on the report of the First Committee (A/57/510)]
57/66.	National legislation on transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology


	The General Assembly,
	Recognizing that disarmament, arms control and non-proliferation are essential for the maintenance of international peace and security and that effective national control over the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology is an important tool in achieving these objectives,
	Recalling that the States parties to the international disarmament and non-proliferation treaties have undertaken, inter alia, both to control transfers that could contribute to proliferation activities and to facilitate the fullest possible exchange of materials, equipment and technological information for peaceful purposes, in accordance with the provisions of those treaties,
	Considering that the exchange of national legislation, regulations and procedures on the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology contributes to mutual understanding and confidence among Member States,
	Convinced that such an exchange would be beneficial to Member States that are in the process of developing such legislation,
	Reaffirming the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence in accordance with Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations,
	1.	Invites Member States that are in a position to do so to enact or improve national legislation, regulations and procedures to exercise effective control over the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology, while ensuring that such legislation, regulations and procedures are consistent with the obligations of States parties under international treaties;
	2.	Encourages Member States to provide, on a voluntary basis, information to the Secretary-General on their national legislation, regulations and procedures on the transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology, as well as the changes therein, and requests the Secretary-General to make this information accessible for Member States;
	3.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-eighth session an item entitled "National legislation on transfer of arms, military equipment and dual-use goods and technology".

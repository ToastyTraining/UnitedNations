	Recognizing the right of Member States to request circulation of communications as official documents,

	2.	Requests the Secretary-General to enforce, where appropriate, the existing page limits referred to in paragraph 1 above in respect of all documents originating in the Secretariat, to review these limits, where appropriate, with a view to achieving an overall reduction of documentation without affecting its quality and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its fifty-first session through the Committee on Conferences;

	(a)	To consider the possibility of requesting oral reports, without prejudice to the provision of information to delegations in all the official languages;

	(a)	To provide an oral estimate of the cost of documents or reports requested by Member States, without prejudice to the right of intergovernmental bodies to request such documents or reports;

[on the report of the First Committee (A/70/462)]
70/69.	Thirty-fifth anniversary of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 34/83 M of 11 December 1979, in which it requested the Secretary-General to establish the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research, and its resolution 39/148 H of 17 December 1984, in which it approved the statute of the Institute,
	Recalling also its resolutions 45/62 G of 4 December 1990, 55/35 A of 20 November 2000, 60/89 of 8 December 2005 and 65/87 of 8 December 2010 on the tenth, twentieth, twenty-fifth and thirtieth anniversaries of the Institute,
	Considering the continuing need for the international community to have access to independent and in-depth research on security issues and prospects for disarmament and non-proliferation,
	Underlining the particularly relevant contribution of the Institute to thinking and analysis on international security issues in the current context,
	Recognizing the potential of the Institute, through its research, seminars, networks, outreach activities and publications, to assist ongoing negotiations on disarmament and efforts at ensuring greater international security at a progressively lower level of armaments and to contribute to education in this regard,
	Reiterating its preoccupation over the unsustainable financing situation of the institutional operations budget of the Institute,
	Recognizing that a viable solution to the Institute's difficulties and its effective management will be instrumental for the Institute, as an autonomous institution within the framework of the United Nations, to take forward its mandate in fulfilling Member States' expectations and facilitating progress in disarmament efforts,
	Noting the lack of implementation to date of the recommendations of the Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters, and underlining the observations and recommendations of the Board contained in the latest report of the Secretary-General on its work,1
	Expressing its support for the Institute in its efforts to fully comply with Umoja and the International Public Sector Accounting Standards,
	1.	Welcomes the thirty-fifth anniversary of the establishment of the United Nations Institute for Disarmament Research;
	2.	Recognizes the importance, the timeliness and the high quality of the work of the Institute;
	3.	Reiterates its conviction that the Institute should continue to conduct independent research on problems relating to disarmament and security and to undertake specialized research requiring a high degree of expertise;
	4.	Emphasizes the importance of the Institute as a stand-alone, autonomous institution that contributes, through its research, analysis and activities, to progress in disarmament and, ultimately, to a safer world;
	5.	Underlines the contribution that the Institute makes and should continue to make in the field of disarmament and non-proliferation education in all regions of the world;
	6.	Appeals to all Member States to continue to make financial contributions to the Institute, and strongly encourages them to unearmark these contributions so as to contribute to its viability and the quality of its work over the long term;
	7.	Welcomes the establishment of a revolving capital fund (the Stability Fund) in January 2015, and encourages Member States to contribute to this fund;
	8.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to give the Institute administrative and other support;
	9.	Also requests the Secretary-General, as an exceptional, one-off measure to preserve the future of the Institute and without setting a precedent, to submit, in the context of the programme budget for the biennium 2018-2019, a funding proposal taking into account additional resources in the light of the recommendations contained in the latest report of the Secretary-General on the work of the Advisory Board on Disarmament Matters;1
	10.	Further requests the Secretary-General to commission an assessment by an independent third party with a mandate to prepare a report on the future structural, financial, administrative and operational aspects of the Institute, outlining a sustainable and stable funding structure and operating model as required to achieve the mandate and objectives of the Institute beyond the biennium 2018-2019, and to report in this regard, taking into account the aforementioned assessment, to the General Assembly at its seventy-third session.

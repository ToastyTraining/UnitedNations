54/272.   Financing of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan

    The General Assembly,

    Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan1 and the related reports of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

    Recalling Security Council resolution 968 (1994) of 16 December 1994, by which the Council established the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan, and the subsequent resolutions by which the Council extended the mandate of the Mission of Observers, the latest of which was resolution 1274 (1999) of 12 November 1999,

    Recalling also Security Council resolution 1138 (1997) of 14 November 1997, by which the Council authorized the Secretary-General to expand the size of the Mission of Observers,

    Recalling further its resolution 49/240 of 31 March 1995 on the financing of the Mission of Observers and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 53/19 B of 8 June 1999,

    Reaffirming that the costs of the Mission of Observers are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,


    Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Mission of Observers, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,

    Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

    Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

    Noting with appreciation that voluntary contributions have been made to the Mission of Observers,

    Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the account of the Mission of Observers with the necessary financial resources to enable it to meet its outstanding liabilities,

    1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan as at 30 April 2000, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 4.5 million United States dollars, representing some 6.5 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Mission of Observers to the period ending 15 May 2000, notes that some 34 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, in particular those in arrears, to ensure payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

    2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peacekeeping activities, in particular as regards the reimbursements to troop contributors that bear additional burdens owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

    3.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States which have paid their assessed contributions in full;

    4.	Urges all other Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Mission of Observers in full;

    5.	Expresses concern at the delay experienced by the Secretary-General in deploying and providing adequate resources to some recent peacekeeping missions, in particular those in Africa;

    6.	Emphasizes that all future and existing peacekeeping missions shall be given equal and non-discriminatory treatment in respect of financial and administrative arrangements;

    7.	Also emphasizes that all peacekeeping missions shall be provided with adequate resources for the effective and efficient discharge of their respective mandates;

    8.	Endorses the conclusions and recommendations contained in the report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,3 and requests the Secretary-General to ensure their full implementation;
    
    9.	Decides that Member States that have fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission of Observers shall be credited their respective share of the unencumbered balance of 3,639,400 dollars gross (3,213,100 dollars net) in respect of the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999;

    10.	Decides also that, for Member States that have not fulfilled their financial obligations to the Mission of Observers, their share of the unencumbered balance of 3,639,400 dollars gross (3,213,100 dollars net) in respect of the period from 1 July 1998 to 30 June 1999 shall be set off against their outstanding obligations;

    11.	Emphasizes that no peacekeeping mission shall be financed by borrowing funds from other active peacekeeping missions;

    12.	Encourages the Secretary-General to continue to take additional measures to ensure the safety and security of all personnel under the auspices of the United Nations participating in the Mission of Observers;

    13.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-fifth session the item entitled "Financing of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan".

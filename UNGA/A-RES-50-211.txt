	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/50/848)]


50/211.Financing of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda 1/ and the related oral report of the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions, 2/

	Recalling Security Council resolution 1029 (1995) of 12 December 1995, by which the Council adjusted and extended the mandate of the Assistance Mission for a final period until 8 March 1996, as well as all previous Council resolutions on the Assistance Mission,

	Recalling also its resolution 48/248 of 5 April 1994 on the financing of the Assistance Mission and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which was resolution 49/20 B of 12 July 1995,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Assistance Mission are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling further its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Assistance Mission, a different procedure is required from that applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,


	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Mindful of the fact that it is essential to provide the Assistance Mission with the necessary financial resources to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities under the relevant resolutions of the Security Council,

	1.	Takes note of the status of contributions to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda as at 19 December 1995, including the contributions outstanding in the amount of 74,322,512 United States dollars, representing 17 per cent of the total assessed contributions from the inception of the Assistance Mission to the period ending 8 December 1995, notes that some 22 per cent of the Member States have paid their assessed contributions in full, and urges all other Member States concerned, particularly those in arrears, to ensure the payment of their outstanding assessed contributions;

	2.	Expresses concern about the financial situation with regard to peace-keeping activities, particularly as regards the reimbursement of troop contributors, notably those troop-contributing Member States that have paid their assessed contributions in full, which bear an additional burden owing to overdue payments by Member States of their assessments;

	3.	Urges all Member States to make every possible effort to ensure payment of their assessed contributions to the Assistance Mission promptly and in full;

	4.	Endorses, on an exceptional basis, in the absence of a written report, the oral observations and recommendations presented by the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions;

	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to take all necessary action to ensure that the Assistance Mission is administered with a maximum of efficiency and economy;

	6.	Decides to appropriate to the Special Account for the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda the amount of 32,324,500 dollars gross (31,828,900 dollars net) for the operation of the Assistance Mission for the period from 1 January to 8 March 1996;

	7.	Decides also, as an ad hoc arrangement, to apportion the amount of 32,324,500 dollars gross (31,828,900 dollars net) for the period from 1 January to 8 March 1996 among Member States in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991 and 47/218 A of 23 December 1992 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993 and 50/451 B of 23 December 1995, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the year 1996;

	8.	Decides further that, in accordance with the provisions of its resolution 973 (X) of 15 December 1955, there shall be set off against the apportionment among Member States, as provided for in paragraph 7 above, their respective share in the Tax Equalization Fund of the estimated staff assessment income of 495,600 dollars for the period from 1 January to 8 March 1996, inclusive;


	9.	Invites voluntary contributions to the Assistance Mission in cash and in the form of services and supplies acceptable to the Secretary-General, to be administered, as appropriate, in accordance with the procedure established by the General Assembly in its resolutions 43/230 of 21 December 1988, 44/192 A of 21 December 1989 and 45/258 of 3 May 1991;

	10.	Decides to keep the agenda item entitled "Financing of the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda" under review during the fiftieth session.

[on the report of the Second Committee (A/56/566)]

56/207.	Implementation of the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006), including the proposal to establish a world solidarity fund for poverty eradication


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 47/196 of 22 December 1992, by which it established the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, as well as its resolution 48/183 of 21 December 1993, by which it proclaimed 1996 the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty, 
	Recalling also its resolution 50/107 of 20 December 1995 on the observance of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty and the proclamation of the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006), as well as the declarations and programmes of action of the major United Nations conferences and summits, their follow-up and the need for their implementation, as they relate to the eradication of poverty, 
	Recalling further the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 adopted by heads of State and Government on the occasion of the Millennium Summit, 
	Recalling its resolution 55/210 of 20 December 2000, entitled "Implementation of the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006), including the initiative to establish a world solidarity fund for poverty eradication", 
	Expressing its deep concern that the number of people living in extreme poverty in many countries continues to increase, with women and children constituting the majority and the most affected group, in particular in African countries and the least developed countries,
	Recognizing that, while the rate of poverty in some countries has been reduced, some developing countries and disadvantaged groups are being marginalized and others are at risk of being marginalized and effectively excluded from the benefits of globalization, resulting in increased income disparity among and within countries, thereby constraining efforts to eradicate poverty,
	Recognizing also that for the poverty eradication strategy to be effective it is imperative for developing countries to be integrated into the world economy and equitably share the benefits of globalization,
	Recalling the commitment made by the heads of State and Government at the Millennium Summit to eradicate extreme poverty, in particular the commitment to halve, by 2015, the proportion of the world's people whose income is less than one dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger,
	Bearing in mind the Copenhagen Declaration on Social Development,2 the Programme of Action of the World Summit for Social Development3 and the Political Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its twenty-fourth special session, entitled "World Summit for Social Development and beyond: achieving social development for all in a globalizing world", held at Geneva from 26 June to 1 July 2000,4 as well as the objectives of the World Food Summit, held at Rome from 13 to 17 November 1996,
	Recognizing that, while it is the primary responsibility of States to attain economic and social development and to achieve the development and poverty eradication goals as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the international community should support the efforts of the developing countries to eradicate poverty and ensure basic social protection and to promote an enabling international environment,
	Expressing concern at the recent economic slowdown, particularly its adverse impact on the economies of developing countries, which could hinder the realization of agreed development goals, in particular the eradication of poverty,
	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on the first United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006),5
	1.	Stresses that the United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006) should contribute to achieving the targets of halving, by 2015, the proportion of the world's people whose income is less than one dollar a day and the proportion of people who suffer from hunger, through decisive national action and strengthened international cooperation;
	2.	Reaffirms, as set out in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 that success in meeting the objectives of development and poverty eradication depends, inter alia, on good governance within each country, and that it also depends on good governance at the international level, on transparency in the financial, monetary and trading systems and on commitment to an open, equitable, rule-based, predictable and non-discriminatory multilateral trading and financial system;
	3.	Recognizes that success in meeting the objective of poverty eradication requires an enabling environment that encourages, inter alia, sustainable development, including economic growth that favours the poor and that upholds human rights, including the right to development, democratic principles and the rule of law, at all levels;
	4.	Also recognizes the responsibility of Governments to adopt policies aimed at preventing and combating corrupt practices at the national and international levels;
	5.	Calls upon all countries to formulate and implement outcome-oriented national strategies and programmes, setting time-bound targets for poverty reduction, including the target of halving, by 2015, the proportion of people living in extreme poverty, which requires the strengthening of national action and international cooperation;
	6.	Calls for strengthened efforts at all levels to implement fully and effectively the United Nations Millennium Declaration, as well as the relevant resolutions and decisions of the United Nations and all agreements and commitments adopted at the major United Nations conferences and summits and their follow-up, as they relate to the eradication of poverty, with a view to achieving tangible results;
	7.	Stresses the importance of tackling the root causes of poverty and the necessity of meeting the basic needs of all, and in this context emphasizes the fundamental role in the eradication of poverty of strong and sustained economic growth that favours the poor, creates substantive expansion in productive opportunities and employment, increases incomes, promotes equitable income distribution and minimizes environmental degradation;
	8.	Also stresses the importance of increasing access to and control over resources, including land, skills, knowledge, capital and social connections, for the poor, in particular women, and of improving access for all to basic social services;
	9.

	10.	Urges the strengthening of international assistance to developing countries in their efforts to alleviate poverty, inter alia, by creating an enabling environment that would facilitate the integration of developing countries into the world economy, improving their market access, facilitating the flow of financial resources and implementing fully and effectively all initiatives already launched regarding debt relief for developing countries, and emphasizes that the international community should consider further measures that would lead to effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries so that they can share equally in the benefits of globalization, cope with its negative effects, avoid being marginalized in the process of globalization and achieve full integration into the world economy;
	11.	Reaffirms that, within the context of overall action for the eradication of poverty, special attention should be given to the multidimensional nature of poverty and the national and international conditions and policies that are conducive to its eradication, fostering, inter alia, the social and economic integration of people living in poverty, thus empowering them to participate in decision-making with regard to the policies that affect them, the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including the right to development, bearing in mind the relationship between all human rights and development, and an efficient, transparent and accountable public service and administration;
	12.	Recognizes that the eradication of poverty and the achievement and preservation of peace are mutually reinforcing;
	13.

	14.	Welcomes the efforts made by the United Nations system to assign priority to the eradication of poverty and to enhance coordination, and in this regard encourages the organizations of the United Nations system, including the Bretton Woods institutions, and other partners in development to continue to support all Member States, members of specialized agencies and United Nations observers in carrying forward their own strategy for the achievement of the objectives of the Decade;
	15.	Also welcomes the holding of the International Conference on Financing for Development at Monterrey, Mexico, from 18 to 22 March 2002, and encourages Governments and stakeholders to take concrete initiatives and actions in support of financing for development;
	16.	Further welcomes the convening of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, to be held at Johannesburg, South Africa, from 26 August to 4 September 2002, as a significant opportunity to renew our commitment to sustainable development, the international development goals, Agenda 21,6 and the principles contained in the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development;7
	17.	Notes the outcome of the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organization, held at Doha from 9 to 13 November 2001;8
	18.	Recognizes the importance of the expansion of international trade as an engine of growth and development and, in this context, the need for expeditious and complete integration of developing countries and countries with economies in transition into the international trading system, in full cognizance of the opportunities and challenges of globalization and liberalization and taking into account the circumstances of individual countries, in particular the trade interests and development needs of developing countries;
	19.	Also recognizes the critical need for countries to undertake economic, institutional and regulatory reforms to support wide trade liberalization and to create an enabling environment in which trade can truly serve as an engine for economic growth and development, and in this regard calls upon the international community to continue to support the capacity-building efforts of developing countries, taking into account their national circumstances;
	20.	Reaffirms that all Governments and the United Nations system should promote an active and visible policy of mainstreaming a gender perspective in all policies and programmes aimed at the eradication of poverty, at both the national and the international level, and encourages the use of gender analysis as a tool for the integration of a gender dimension into planning the implementation of policies, strategies and programmes for the eradication of poverty;
	21.	Expresses its appreciation to the developed countries that have agreed to and have reached the target of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product for overall official development assistance, and calls upon the developed countries that have not yet done so to strengthen their efforts to achieve the agreed target as soon as possible and, where agreed, within that target, to earmark 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of their gross national product for the least developed countries;
	22.	Stresses the important role played by official development assistance in complementing domestic efforts to meet the development needs of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, and in this regard acknowledges the official development assistance made available to developing countries and the efforts that developing countries have made to eradicate poverty;
	23.	Calls for the full, speedy and effective implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, and in this regard stresses the need for the donor community to provide the additional resources necessary to fulfil the future financial requirements of the Initiative, welcomes the agreement that financing for heavily indebted poor countries should be reviewed analytically and separately from International Development Association replenishment requirements but immediately after meetings for the thirteenth replenishment of the Association, and calls upon all donors to participate fully in this process;

	26.	Recognizes the difficulties faced by heavily indebted middle-income developing countries in meeting their external debt and debt-servicing obligations, and notes the worsening situation in some of them in the context, inter alia, of greater liquidity constraints, which may require debt treatment through various national and international measures designed to assist those countries in making their debt burden sustainable in the long term and in combating poverty effectively;
	27.	Calls upon the developed countries, by means of intensified and effective cooperation with developing countries, to promote capacity-building and facilitate access to and transfer of technologies and corresponding knowledge, in particular to developing countries, on favourable terms, including concessional and preferential terms, as mutually agreed, taking into account the need to protect intellectual property rights, as well as the special needs of developing countries, by identifying and implementing practical steps to ensure the achievement of progress in this regard and to assist developing countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty in an era influenced in large measure by technology;
	28.	Stresses that the goal of halving extreme poverty by 2015 will not be achieved without serious efforts to address the development needs of the least developed countries and to support their efforts in improving the lives of their people, and in this regard welcomes the adoption of the Brussels Declaration10 and the Programme of Action for the Least Developed Countries for the Decade 2001-2010,11 at the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, held at Brussels from 14 to 20 May 2001, and calls upon the national Governments of the least developed countries and their development partners to implement fully the commitments undertaken in Brussels;
	29.	Emphasizes the role of microcredit as an important anti-poverty tool that promotes production and self-employment and empowers people living in poverty, especially women, and therefore encourages Governments to adopt policies that support microcredit schemes and the development of microfinance institutions and their capacities, and calls upon the international community, in particular the relevant organs, organizations and bodies of the United Nations system and international and regional financial institutions involved in the eradication of poverty, to support and explore the incorporation of the microcredit approach into their programmes and the further development, as appropriate, of other microfinance instruments;
	30.

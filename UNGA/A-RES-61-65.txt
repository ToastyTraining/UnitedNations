		[on the report of the First Committee (A/61/394)]
61/65.	Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: accelerating the implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 60/56 of 8 December 2005, 
	Expressing its grave concern at the danger to humanity posed by the possibility that nuclear weapons could be used,
	Reaffirming that nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation are mutually reinforcing processes requiring urgent irreversible progress on both fronts,
	Mindful of the contribution of the final report of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission,1
	Recalling the decisions and the resolution on the Middle East of the 1995 Review and Extension Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons2 and the Final Document of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,3
	Recalling also the unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon States to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals, leading to nuclear disarmament, in accordance with commitments made under article VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,4
	Urging States parties to exert all possible efforts to ensure a successful and productive preparatory process for the 2010 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
	1.	Continues to emphasize the central role of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons4 and its universality in achieving nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, and calls upon all States parties to respect their obligations;
	2.	Reaffirms that the outcome of the 2000 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons sets out the agreed process for systematic and progressive efforts towards nuclear disarmament;3
	3.	Reiterates its call upon the nuclear-weapon States to accelerate the implementation of the practical steps towards nuclear disarmament that were agreed upon at the 2000 Review Conference, thereby contributing to a safer world for all;
	4.	Calls upon all States to comply fully with all commitments made regarding nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation and not to act in any way that may compromise either cause or that may lead to a new nuclear arms race;
	5.	Again calls upon all States parties to spare no effort to achieve the universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, and urges India, Israel and Pakistan, which are not yet parties to the Treaty, to accede to it as non-nuclear-weapon States promptly and without conditions;
	6.	Condemns the announced nuclear-weapon test by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on 9 October 2006, all nuclear-weapon tests by States that are not yet parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and any further nuclear-weapon test by any State whatsoever, and urges the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to rescind its announced withdrawal from the Treaty;
	7.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-second session the item entitled "Towards a nuclear-weapon-free world: accelerating the implementation of nuclear disarmament commitments" and to review the implementation of the present resolution at that session.

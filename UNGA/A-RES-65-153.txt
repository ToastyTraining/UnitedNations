	2.	Encourages all States, as well as the United Nations system and all other relevant stakeholders, to take advantage of "Sustainable sanitation: the five-year drive to 2015" as a platform on which to build political will and promote action at all levels, while increasing awareness of the urgent need to reach the goal set out in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation;3

Encourages all Member States, as well as the United Nations system and international organizations and other stakeholders, to approach the sanitation issue in a much broader context and to encompass all its aspects, including hygiene promotion, provision of basic sanitation services, sewerage, and wastewater treatment and reuse in the context of integrated water management.

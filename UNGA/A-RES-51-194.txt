	Reaffirming also the guiding principles contained in section I of the annex to its resolution 46/182,

	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,1  in particular of the attention paid by the Secretary-General to effectiveness, accountability and transparency in humanitarian assistance under increasingly complex operational environments and the need for further efforts to identify and support the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation, reconstruction and long-term development,

	Taking note of the establishment, within the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat, of Reliefweb, for the dissemination of reliable and timely information on natural disasters and other emergencies,

	Taking note also of the relevant decisions of operational agencies, organizations, programmes and funds of the United Nations system concerning their participation in a coordinated response to humanitarian emergencies,


	Recognizing the need for coordinated humanitarian assistance and adequate financial resources to ensure a prompt, timely and effective response by the United Nations to natural disasters and other emergencies, both for immediate relief and for the smooth transition from relief to rehabilitation, reconstruction and long-term development, which are not necessarily sequential and often proceed at the same time,

	Bearing in mind the critical importance of prevention, preparedness and contingency planning for a timely and effective response to both natural and other emergencies by the Governments concerned and the international community,

	Welcoming the request to the Secretary-General by the Economic and Social Council, in its resolution 1995/56, to submit to the Council, at its substantive session of 1997, in close cooperation with relevant organizations of the United Nations system, a comprehensive analytical report, including options, proposals and recommendations for a review of issues concerning the role and operational responsibilities and strengthening of all aspects of the capacity of the United Nations system for humanitarian assistance,

	Deeply concerned about the suffering of victims of disasters and emergency situations, the loss of human lives, the flow of refugees, the mass displacement of people and the material destruction,

	Reaffirming that the sovereignty, territorial integrity and national unity of States must be fully respected in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and, in this context, that humanitarian assistance should be provided with the consent of the affected country and in principle on the basis of an appeal of the affected country,

	Reaffirming also that each State has the responsibility first and foremost to take care of the victims of natural disasters and other emergencies occurring on its territory, and hence, the affected State has the primary role in the initiation, organization, coordination and implementation of humanitarian assistance within its territory,

	Strongly emphasizing the urgent need to ensure, respect and promote international humanitarian law, principles and norms, the safety of humanitarian personnel and the need for States whose populations are in need of humanitarian assistance to facilitate the work of humanitarian organizations in implementing humanitarian assistance, in particular the supply of food, medicines, shelter and health care, for which access to victims is essential, and reaffirming that humanitarian assistance must be provided in accordance with the principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality,

	Concerned about the impediments created by natural disasters and similar emergencies to the development efforts of the affected countries, and welcoming the efforts of the Department of Humanitarian Affairs, in the context of the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction, to promote disaster prevention, mitigation and preparedness measures,

Calls upon the international community, in particular the donor countries, to expand, where possible, fund-raising channels and to provide adequate financial resources and medical and technical assistance to the affected developing countries, in particular African countries and least developed countries, for the successful implementation of work plans and projects and the achievement of significant progress in both the short and the  medium term in controlling malaria, and to intensify basic and applied research on anti-malarial vaccines as a priority;

	8.	Encourages the Director-General of the World Health Organization, through the World Health Organization's Division of Control of Tropical Diseases, to continue his efforts to mobilize international organizations, multilateral financial institutions, the specialized agencies, organs and programmes of the United Nations system and non-governmental organizations as well as other groups to provide the affected developing countries, in particular African countries, with technical, medical and financial resources and assistance commensurate with the needs set forth in those countries' national plans to control malaria;

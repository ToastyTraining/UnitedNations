	Recognizing further that prospects for closer Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in all spheres can be enhanced by positive developments world wide, in particular in Europe, in the Maghreb and in the Middle East,


	Noting with satisfaction the positive developments in the Middle East peace process that will lead to achieving a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the region and therefore to promoting confidence-building measures and a good-neighbourly spirit among the countries of the area,

	Expressing satisfaction at the growing awareness of the need for more joint efforts by all Mediterranean countries so as to strengthen economic, social, cultural and environmental cooperation in the region,

	Reaffirming the responsibility of all States to contribute to the stability and prosperity of the Mediterranean region and their commitment to respect the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, as well as the provisions of the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, 1/

	2.	Expresses its satisfaction at the continuing efforts by Mediterranean countries to contribute actively to the elimination of all causes of tension in the region and to the promotion of just and lasting solutions to the persistent problems of the region through peaceful means, thus ensuring the withdrawal of foreign forces of occupation and respecting the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of all countries of the Mediterranean and the right of peoples to self-determination, and therefore calls for full adherence to the principles of non-interference, non-intervention, non-use of force or threat of use of force and the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by force, in accordance with the Charter and the relevant resolutions of the United Nations;

	3.	Commends the efforts by the Mediterranean countries in meeting common challenges through coordinated overall responses, based on a spirit of multilateral partnership, towards the general objective of turning the Mediterranean basin into an area of dialogue, exchanges and cooperation, guaranteeing peace, stability and prosperity;

	6.	Encourages all States of the region to favour the necessary conditions for strengthening the confidence-building measures among them by promoting genuine openness and transparency on all military matters, by participating, inter alia, in the United Nations system for the standardized reporting of military expenditures as well as by providing accurate data and information to the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms;

	7.	Encourages the Mediterranean countries to strengthen further their cooperation in combating terrorism, which poses a serious threat to peace, security and stability in the region and therefore to the improvement of the current political, economic and social situation;

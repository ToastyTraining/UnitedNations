	The General Assembly,

	Recalling that in its resolution 1911 (XVIII) of 27 November 1963 it expressed the hope that the States of Latin America would take appropriate measures to conclude a treaty that would prohibit nuclear weapons in Latin America,

	Recalling also that in the same resolution it voiced its confidence that, once such a treaty was concluded, all States, and in particular the nuclear-weapon States, would lend it their full cooperation for the effective realization of its peaceful aims,

	Considering that in its resolution 2028 (XX) of 19 November 1965 it established the principle of an acceptable balance of mutual responsibilities and obligations between nuclear-weapon States and those which do not possess such weapons,

	Recalling that the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco)1 was opened for signature at Mexico City on 14 February 1967,

	Welcoming the holding of the eleventh special session of the General Conference of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean on 14 February 1997 in commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the opening for signature of the Treaty of Tlatelolco, as well as the holding of the international seminar on the topic "Nuclear-weapon-free zones in the next century" in Mexico City on 13 and 14 February 1997,


	Recalling that in its preamble the Treaty of Tlatelolco states that military denuclearized zones are not an end in themselves but rather a means for achieving general and complete disarmament at a later stage,

	Recalling also that in its resolution 2286 (XXII) of 5 December 1967 it welcomed with special satisfaction the Treaty of Tlatelolco as an event of historic significance in the efforts to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and to promote international peace and security,

	Recalling further that in 1990, 1991 and 1992 the General Conference of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean approved and opened for signature a set of amendments2 to the Treaty of Tlatelolco,1 with the aim of enabling the full entry into force of that instrument,

	Recalling resolution C/E/RES.27 of the Council of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean,3 in which the Council called for the promotion of cooperation and consultations with other nuclear-weapon-free zones,

	Noting with satisfaction that, with the full adherence on 14 February 1997 of Saint Kitts and Nevis, the Treaty of Tlatelolco is in force for thirty-two sovereign States of the region,

	Also noting with satisfaction that on 22 October 1996 Paraguay and on 14 February 1997 Barbados and Venezuela deposited their instruments of ratification of the amendments to the Treaty of Tlatelolco approved by the General Conference of the Agency for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean in its resolutions 267 (E-V) of 3 July 1990, 268 (XII) of 10 May 1991 and 290 (E-VII) of 26 August 1992, and that on 23 October 1997 Guatemala signed the amendment to the Treaty contained in resolution 268 (XII),

	Further noting with satisfaction that the amended Treaty of Tlatelolco is fully in force for Argentina, Barbados, Brazil, Chile, Guyana, Jamaica, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Uruguay and Venezuela,

	1.	Welcomes the concrete steps taken by some countries of the region during the past year for the consolidation of the regime of military denuclearization established by the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco);1 

	2.	Notes with satisfaction the full adherence of Saint Kitts and Nevis to the Treaty of Tlatelolco;

	4.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-third session the item entitled "Consolidation of the regime established by the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean (Treaty of Tlatelolco)".

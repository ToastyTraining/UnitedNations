	The General Assembly,

	Having examined the chapter of the report of the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples for 2012 relating to Tokelau,1
	Recalling its resolution 1514 (XV) of 14 December 1960, containing the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, and all resolutions and decisions of the United Nations relating to Non-Self-Governing Territories, in particular General Assembly resolution 66/88 of 9 December 2011, 
	Noting with appreciation the continuing exemplary cooperation of New Zealand as the administering Power with regard to the work of the Special Committee relating to Tokelau and its readiness to permit access by United Nations visiting missions to the Territory,
	Noting with appreciation also the collaborative contribution to the development of Tokelau by New Zealand and the specialized agencies and other organizations of the United Nations system, in particular the United Nations Development Programme,
	Noting that, as a small island Territory, Tokelau exemplifies the situation of most remaining Non-Self-Governing Territories and that, as a case study pointing to successful cooperation for decolonization, Tokelau has wider significance for the United Nations as it seeks to complete its work in decolonization,
	Noting also the status of Tokelau as an associate member of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations,
	Recalling that New Zealand and Tokelau signed on 21 November 2003 a document entitled "Joint statement of the principles of partnership", which sets out the rights and responsibilities of the two partners,
	Bearing in mind the decision of the General Fono at its meeting in November 2003, following extensive consultations undertaken in all three villages, to explore formally with New Zealand the option of self-government in free association and its decision in August 2005 to hold in February 2006 a referendum on self-determination on the basis of a draft constitution for Tokelau and a draft treaty of free association with New Zealand, and its subsequent decision to hold a further referendum in October 2007, and that the two referendums did not produce the two-thirds majority of the valid votes cast required by the General Fono to change the status of Tokelau from that of a Non-Self-Governing Territory under the administration of New Zealand,
	1.	Acknowledges the decision of the General Fono in 2008 that consideration of any future act of self-determination by Tokelau will be deferred and that New Zealand and Tokelau will devote renewed effort and attention to ensuring that essential services and infrastructure on the atolls of Tokelau are enhanced and strengthened, thereby ensuring an enhanced quality of life for the people of Tokelau;
	2.	Welcomes the progress made towards the devolution of power to the three taupulega (village councils) since 2004; 
	3.	Notes that Tokelau and New Zealand remain firmly committed to the ongoing development of Tokelau for the long-term benefit of the people of Tokelau, with particular emphasis on the further development of facilities on each atoll that meet their current requirements; 
	4.	Acknowledges the adoption by Tokelau of its National Strategic Plan for 2010-2015 and that the Joint Commitment for Development between Tokelau and New Zealand 2011-2015 will focus on a viable transportation arrangement, infrastructure development, human resources capacity and the strengthening of governance;
	5.	Also acknowledges the ongoing and consistent commitment of New Zealand to meeting the social and economic requirements of the people of Tokelau, as well as the support and cooperation of the United Nations Development Programme;
	6.	Further acknowledges Tokelau's need for continued support from the international community;
	7.	Recalls with satisfaction the establishment and operation of the Tokelau International Trust Fund to support the ongoing needs of Tokelau, and calls upon Member States and international and regional agencies to contribute to the Fund and thereby lend practical support to Tokelau in overcoming the problems of smallness, isolation and lack of resources;
	8.	Welcomes the cooperative attitude of the other States and territories in the region towards Tokelau and their support for its economic and political aspirations and its increasing participation in regional and international affairs;
	9.	Calls upon the administering Power and United Nations agencies to continue to provide assistance to Tokelau as it further develops;
	10.	Welcomes the actions taken by the administering Power to transmit to the Secretary-General under Article 73 e of the Charter of the United Nations information regarding the political, economic and social situation of Tokelau;
	11.	Also welcomes the commitment of both Tokelau and New Zealand to continue to work together in the interests of Tokelau and its people;
	12.	Further welcomes the commitment of Tokelau, with the assistance of the administering Power, to the reduction in the use of fossil fuels, with the aim of meeting its electricity needs entirely through renewable energy by the end of 2012;
	13.	Requests the Special Committee on the Situation with regard to the Implementation of the Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples to continue to examine the question of the Non-Self-Governing Territory of Tokelau and to report thereon to the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session.

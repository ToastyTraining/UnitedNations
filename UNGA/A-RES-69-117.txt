[on the report of the Sixth Committee (A/69/497)]
69/117.	United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 2099 (XX) of 20 December 1965, in which the General Assembly established the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law to contribute towards a better knowledge of international law as a means of strengthening international peace and security and promoting friendly relations and cooperation among States,
	Reaffirming that the Programme of Assistance is a core activity of the United Nations and that it has provided the foundation for the efforts of the United Nations to promote a better knowledge of international law for nearly half a century,
	Recognizing the major contribution of the Programme of Assistance to the teaching and dissemination of international law for the benefit of lawyers in all countries, legal systems and regions of the world for almost half a century,
	Emphasizing the important contribution of the Programme of Assistance, in particular the United Nations Regional Courses in International Law and the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law, to the furtherance of United Nations rule of law programmes and activities,
	Reaffirming that the increasing demand for international law training and dissemination activities creates new challenges for the Programme of Assistance,
	Recognizing the importance of the Programme of Assistance effectively reaching its beneficiaries, including with regard to languages, while bearing in mind limitations on available resources,
	Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the Programme of Assistance1 and the views of the Advisory Committee on the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law, which are contained in the report,2
	Noting with concern that the activities of the Programme of Assistance, in particular the organization of the United Nations Regional Courses in International Law on a regular basis and the further development of the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law, cannot be sustained with the resources available under the current programme budget, notwithstanding its resolutions 64/113 of 16 December 2009, 65/25 of 6 December 2010, 66/97 of 9 December 2011, 67/91 of 14 December 2012 and 68/110 of 16 December 2013,
	Noting with regret that the United Nations Regional Courses in International Law for Asia-Pacific and for Latin America and the Caribbean for 2014 were cancelled owing to insufficient funds and that no United Nations Regional Course in International Law for Latin America and the Caribbean has been held in the past decade,
	Considering that international law should occupy an appropriate place in the teaching of legal disciplines at all universities,
	Convinced that States, international and regional organizations, universities and institutions should be encouraged to give further support to the Programme of Assistance and to increase their activities to promote the teaching, study, dissemination and wider appreciation of international law, in particular those activities which are of special benefit to persons from developing countries,
	Reaffirming that in the conduct of the Programme of Assistance it would be desirable to use as far as possible the resources and facilities made available by Member States, international and regional organizations, universities, institutions and others,
	Reaffirming also the hope that, in appointing highly qualified lecturers for the seminars to be held within the framework of the fellowship programmes in international law, account would be taken of the need to secure the representation of major legal systems and balance among various geographical regions,
	1.	Reiterates its approval of the guidelines and recommendations contained in section III of the report of the Secretary-General to the General Assembly at its sixty-eighth session,3 in particular those designed to strengthen and revitalize the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law in response to the increasing demand for international law training and dissemination activities;
	2.	Authorizes the Secretary-General to carry out the activities specified in his reports3,4 in 2015;
	3.	Also authorizes the Secretary-General to award a minimum of one scholarship in 2015 under the Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe Memorial Fellowship on the Law of the Sea;
	4.	Further authorizes the Secretary-General to continue and further develop the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law as a major contribution to the teaching and dissemination of international law around the world and to continue to finance this activity from provisions in the regular budget as well as, when necessary, from voluntary financial contributions, which would be received as a result of the requests set out in paragraphs 22 and 23 below;
	5.	Expresses its appreciation to the Secretary-General for the activities conducted under the Programme of Assistance and, in particular, for the efforts to strengthen, expand and enhance the international law training and dissemination activities within the framework of the Programme of Assistance in 2014;
	6.	Notes with serious concern that the provisions of paragraph 7 of resolutions 66/97, 67/91 and 68/110 have not been implemented, and therefore decides to revisit the matter of funding for the Programme of Assistance under the programme budget for the biennium 2014-2015, in particular the United Nations Regional Courses in International Law and the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law for the year 2015;
	7.	Requests the Secretary-General to include additional resources under the proposed programme budget for the biennium 2016-2017 for the organization of the Regional Courses in International Law for Africa, for Asia-Pacific and for Latin America and the Caribbean each year, and for the continuation and further development of the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law;
	8.	Also requests the Secretary-General to include in the regular budget, for consideration by the General Assembly, the necessary funding for the Hamilton Shirley Amerasinghe Memorial Fellowship on the Law of the Sea with effect from the biennium 2016-2017, should voluntary contributions be insufficient for granting at least one fellowship a year;
	9.	Further requests the Secretary-General to consider admitting, for participation in the various components of the Programme of Assistance, candidates from countries willing to bear the entire cost of their participation;

	11.	Reiterates its request that the Secretary-General issue the next volume of the United Nations Legislative Series containing materials on the responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts;
	12.	Appreciates the efforts that were undertaken by the Office of Legal Affairs to bring up to date the United Nations legal publications, in particular by the Codification Division of the Office of Legal Affairs for its desktop publishing initiative from 2003 to 2013, which greatly enhanced the timely issuance of its legal publications and made possible the preparation of legal training materials, regrets that none of the publications referred to in the previous report of the Secretary-General5 was issued in 2014, when desktop publishing was discontinued owing to lack of resources, and recommends that the necessary resources be made available to resume this successful initiative;
	13.	Requests the Office of Legal Affairs to continue to maintain and expand its websites listed in the annex to the report of the Secretary-General6 as an invaluable tool for the dissemination of international law materials as well as for advanced legal research;
	14.	Requests that interns and research assistants be enlisted for the preparation of materials for the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law;
	15.	Commends the Codification Division for the cost-saving measures undertaken with regard to the International Law Fellowship Programme to maintain the number of fellowships available for this comprehensive international law training programme;

Expresses its appreciation to the Hague Academy of International Law for the valuable contribution it continues to make to the Programme of Assistance, which has enabled candidates under the International Law Fellowship Programme to attend and participate in the Fellowship Programme in conjunction with courses at the Academy;
	17.	Notes with appreciation the contributions of the Hague Academy to the teaching, study, dissemination and wider appreciation of international law, and calls upon Member States and interested organizations to give favourable consideration to the appeal of the Academy for a continuation of support and a possible increase in their financial contributions, to enable the Academy to carry out its activities, particularly those relating to the summer courses, regional courses and programmes of the Centre for Studies and Research in International Law and International Relations;
	18.	Welcomes the efforts of the Codification Division to revitalize and conduct United Nations Regional Courses in International Law as an important training activity;
	19.	Expresses its appreciation to Ethiopia for hosting and to Thailand and Uruguay for agreeing to host the United Nations Regional Courses in International Law in 2014, and to Ethiopia, Thailand and Uruguay for agreeing to host the United Nations Regional Courses in International Law for Africa, for Asia-Pacific and, for the first time in over a decade, for Latin America and the Caribbean in 2015, and also expresses its appreciation to Costa Rica for its willingness to host this Regional Course in the future;
	20.	Expresses its appreciation to the African Union for the valuable contribution it continues to make to the United Nations Regional Course in International Law for Africa, which has enabled participants to attend and participate in the Regional Course and the lectures at the African Union;
	21.	Once again encourages the Codification Division to cooperate with the African Institute of International Law, dedicated to offering higher learning and research in international law needed for the development of Africa, in the implementation of the relevant activities under the Programme of Assistance;
	22.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to publicize the Programme of Assistance and periodically to invite Member States, universities, philanthropic foundations and other interested national and international institutions and organizations, as well as individuals, to make voluntary contributions towards the financing of the Programme or otherwise to assist in its implementation and possible expansion;
	23.	Reiterates its request to Member States and interested organizations, institutions and individuals to make voluntary contributions, inter alia, for the International Law Fellowship Programme and the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law;
	24.	Urges, in particular, all Member States and interested organizations, institutions and individuals to make voluntary contributions for the United Nations Regional Courses in International Law organized by the Codification Division as an important complement to the International Law Fellowship Programme, thus alleviating the burden on prospective host countries and making it possible to conduct the Regional Courses on a regular basis;
	25.	Expresses its appreciation to those Member States that have made voluntary contributions to support the Programme of Assistance;
	26.	Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its seventieth session on the implementation of the Programme of Assistance in 2015 and, following consultations with the Advisory Committee on the United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law, to submit recommendations regarding the Programme in subsequent years;
	27.	Concludes once again that voluntary contributions have not proven to be a sustainable method for funding the activities under the Programme of Assistance, in particular the United Nations Regional Courses in International Law and the United Nations Audiovisual Library of International Law, and that, consequently, there is a need to provide more reliable funding for all its activities, taking into account the conclusion of the Advisory Committee at its forty-ninth session;7
	28.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventieth session the item entitled "United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law".

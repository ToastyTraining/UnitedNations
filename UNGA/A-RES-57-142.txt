Resolution adopted by the General Assembly
[without reference to a Main Committee (A/57/L.49 and Add.1)]
		57/142.	Large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing, unauthorized fishing in zones of national jurisdiction and on the high seas/illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, fisheries by-catch and discards, and other developments


	The General Assembly,
	Reaffirming its resolutions 46/215 of 20 December 1991, 49/116 and 49/118 of 19 December 1994, 50/25 of 5 December 1995, 51/36 of 9 December 1996, 52/29 of 26 November 1997, 53/33 of 24 November 1998 and 55/8 of 30 October 2000, as well as other resolutions on large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing, unauthorized fishing in zones of national jurisdiction and on the high seas, fisheries by-catch and discards, and other developments, and bearing in mind resolution 57/143 of 12 December 2002, 
	Noting that the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations1 sets out principles and global standards of behaviour for responsible practices to conserve, manage and develop fisheries, including guidelines for fishing on the high seas and in areas under the national jurisdiction of other States, and on fishing gear selectivity and practices, with the aim of reducing by-catch and discards,
	Welcoming the outcomes of the World Summit on Sustainable Development2 concerning the importance of achieving sustainable fisheries to the maintenance of oceans, seas, islands and coastal areas as an integrated and essential component of the Earth's ecosystem, for global food security and for sustaining economic prosperity and the well-being of many national economies, particularly in developing countries, 
	Noting the importance of the wide application of the precautionary approach to the conservation, management and exploitation of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, in accordance with the Agreement for the Implementation of the Provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks ("the Agreement"),3 and the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries, 
	Noting also the importance of implementing the principles elaborated in article 5 of the Agreement, including ecosystem considerations, in the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, 
	Noting further the Reykjavik Declaration on Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem4 and decisions V/65 and VI/126 of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity,
	Recognizing the importance of integrated, multidisciplinary and multisectoral coastal and ocean management at the national, subregional and regional levels,
	Recognizing also that coordination and cooperation at the global, regional, subregional as well as national levels in the areas, inter alia, of data collection, information-sharing, capacity-building and training are crucial for the conservation, management and sustainable development of marine living resources, 
	Recognizing further the duty provided as a principle in the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas ("the Compliance Agreement"),7 the Agreement and the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries for flag States to exercise effective control over fishing vessels flying their flag and vessels flying their flag which provide support to such vessels, and to ensure that the activities of such vessels do not undermine the effectiveness of conservation and management measures taken in accordance with international law and adopted at the national, subregional, regional or global levels,
	Emphasizing the call made in the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on Sustainable Development ("Johannesburg Plan of Implementation")8 for States to ratify or accede to and then effectively implement the Agreement and the Compliance Agreement, and noting with concern that the latter agreement has not yet entered into force,
	Noting that the Committee on Fisheries of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in February 1999 adopted international plans of action for the management of fishing capacity, for reducing the incidental catch of seabirds in longline fisheries and for the conservation and management of sharks, and noting with concern that only a small number of countries have begun implementation of the international plans of action, 
	Concerned that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing threatens seriously to deplete populations of certain fish species and significantly damage marine ecosystems and that illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing has a detrimental impact on sustainable fisheries, including the food security and the economies of many States, particularly developing States, and in that regard urging States and entities referred to in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ("the Convention")9 and in article 1, paragraph 2 (b) of the Agreement to collaborate in efforts to address these types of fishing activities, 
	Welcoming the adoption by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2001 of the International Plan of Action to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing,10 which focuses on the primary responsibility of the flag State and the use of all available jurisdiction in accordance with international law, including port State measures, coastal State measures, market-related measures and measures to ensure that nationals do not support or engage in illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, 
	Noting that the objective of the International Plan of Action is to prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing by providing all States with comprehensive, effective and transparent measures by which to act, including through appropriate regional fisheries management organizations in accordance with international law,
	Taking note with appreciation of the report of the Secretary-General,11 and emphasizing the useful role that the report plays in bringing together information relating to the sustainable development of the world's marine living resources provided by States, relevant international organizations, regional and subregional fisheries organizations and non-governmental organizations,
	Noting with satisfaction that the incidence of reported large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing activities in most regions of the world's oceans and seas has continued to be low, 
	Concerned that the practice of large-scale pelagic drift-net fishing remains a threat to marine living resources, 
	Expressing its continuing concern that efforts should be made to ensure that the implementation of resolution 46/215 in some parts of the world does not result in the transfer to other parts of the world of drift nets that contravene the resolution, 
	Expressing concern at the significant level of by-catch, including of juvenile fish, and discards in several of the world's fisheries, recognizing that the development and use of selective, environmentally safe and cost-effective fishing gear and techniques will be important for reducing or eliminating by-catch and discards, and calling attention to the impact this activity can have on efforts to conserve and manage fish stocks, including restoring some stocks to sustainable levels,
	Expressing concern also at the reports of continued loss of seabirds, particularly albatrosses, as a result of incidental mortality from longline fishing operations, and the loss of other marine species, including sharks and fin-fish species, as a result of incidental mortality, noting with satisfaction the successful conclusion of negotiations on the Agreement for the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels under the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, and encouraging States to give due consideration to participation in this Agreement, 
	Noting with satisfaction the recent entry into force of the Inter-American Convention for the Protection and Conservation of Sea Turtles and Their Habitats, which contains provisions to minimize the incidental catch of sea turtles in fishing operations,
	Noting with satisfaction also the recent adoption of regional sea turtle conservation instruments in the West African and Indian Ocean-South East Asia regions,
	Recognizing the continuing need for the International Maritime Organization, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the United Nations Environment Programme, in particular its Regional Seas programme, and regional and subregional fisheries management organizations and arrangements to address the issue of marine debris derived from land-based and ship-generated sources of pollution, including derelict fishing gear, which can cause mortality and habitat destruction of marine living resources,
	1.	Reaffirms the importance it attaches to the long-term conservation, management and sustainable use of the marine living resources of the world's oceans and seas and the obligations of States to cooperate to this end, in accordance with international law, as reflected in the relevant provisions of the Convention,9 in particular the provisions on cooperation set out in part V and part VII, section 2, of the Convention regarding straddling stocks, highly migratory species, marine mammals, anadromous stocks and marine living resources of the high seas, and where applicable, the Agreement;3
	2.	Also reaffirms the commitment made at the World Summit on Sustainable Development to restore depleted fish stocks on an urgent basis and where possible not later than 2015;2

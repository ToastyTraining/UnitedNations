50/13.The Olympic Ideal


	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 49/29 of 7 December 1994, in which it requested the Secretary-General to encourage ministers of youth and sport or concerned officials of Member States to participate in the consideration by the General Assembly at its fiftieth session of an item entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic Ideal" on the eve of the centenary of the revival of the Olympic Games in 1896 at Athens, on the initiative of a French educator, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, and called upon Member States to reaffirm during the fiftieth session of the Assembly the observance of the Olympic Truce, during the next Summer Olympic Games,

	Recalling also its resolution 48/11 of 25 October 1993, which, inter alia, revived the ancient Greek tradition of ekecheria or "Olympic Truce", calling for all hostilities to cease during the Games, thereby mobilizing the youth of the world in the cause of peace,

	Taking into account resolution CM/Res.28(LXII), adopted by the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity at its sixty-second ordinary session, held at Addis Ababa from 21 to 23 June 1995, and endorsed by the Assembly of Heads of State and Government of that organization, which supports the appeal for an Olympic Truce,

	Reaffirming that the Olympic Ideal promotes international understanding, particulary among the youth of the world, through sport and culture in order to advance the harmonious development of humankind,


	Nothing with satisfaction the increasing number of joint endeavours of the International Olympic Committee and the United Nations system, such as recent meetings on "Sport against drugs" with the United Nations International Drug Control Programme, "Sport and the environment" with the United Nations Environment Programme, "Sport for all and health for all" with the World Health Organization and "Forum on physical activity and sport" with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,


	1.	Calls upon Member States to reaffirm the observance of an Olympic Truce during the Games of the XXVI Olympiad, the Centennial Games, to be held at Atlanta, United States of America, from 19 July to 4 August 1996, and also calls upon them to reaffirm the observance of the Olympic Truce in advance of each Summer and Winter Olympic Games;

	2.	Commends the International Olympic Committee, now in its one-hundred-and-first year, for promoting international understanding and equality among nations and thereby serving the cause of peace and the well-being of humankind by providing assistance for the development of sport and the Olympic Ideal;

	3.	Welcomes the participation of ministers of youth and sport and concerned officials and the presence of the President of the International Olympic Committee in its consideration of the item entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic Ideal" at its fiftieth session;

	4.	Suggests that national ministries of youth and sport consider collaborating with the Olympic Movement, in the spirit of Olympic ethics and fair play, on preventive education programmes such as anti-doping programmes, drug abuse prevention, environmental protection and enhancing the participation of women in all aspects of the sport movement;

	5.	Requests the Secretary-General to continue to cooperate with the International Olympic Committee in joint endeavours for the promotion of peace, equality among nations and the harmonious development of humankind;

	6.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-second session the item entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic Ideal" and to biennialize this item so that it will be considered in advance of each Summer and Winter Olympic Games.

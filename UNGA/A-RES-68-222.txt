	Emphasizing that middle-income countries must take primary responsibility for their own development and that their national efforts should be complemented by supportive global programmes, measures and policies aimed at expanding the development opportunities of middle-income countries, while taking into account their specific national conditions,
	Reaffirming that the fundamental characteristics of the operational activities for development of the United Nations system should be, inter alia, their universal, voluntary and grant nature, their neutrality and their multilateralism, as well as their ability to respond to the development needs of programme countries in a flexible manner, and that the operational activities are carried out for the benefit of programme countries, at the request of those countries and in accordance with their own policies and priorities for development,
	Emphasizing that there is no "one-size-fits-all" approach to development and that development assistance by the United Nations development system should be able to respond to the varying development needs of programme countries, including the development needs of middle-income countries, and should be aligned with their national development plans and strategies in accordance with its mandates, keeping in mind the needs of the least developed countries,
	Noting that national averages based on criteria such as per capita income do not always reflect the actual particularities and development needs of middle-income countries and that, despite notable reductions in poverty, middle-income countries are still home to the majority of the world's people living in poverty and inequalities remain,
	Recognizing that high degrees of inequality may contribute to vulnerability in middle-income countries and constrain sustainable development in many of those countries, and that economic growth needs to be sustained, inclusive and equitable,
	Stressing that middle-income countries continue to face particular challenges related to, inter alia, job creation, the diversification and transformation of their economies and access to international markets and, in this regard, that efforts to create a national enabling environment for development should be complemented by a global enabling environment,
	Recognizing the need to better understand the multidimensional nature of development and poverty, and acknowledging the significant role that the United Nations system has played and should continue to play in this regard,
	Expressing deep concern about the ongoing adverse impacts, particularly on development, of the world financial and economic crisis, recognizing evidence of an uneven and fragile recovery, cognizant that the global economy, notwithstanding significant efforts that helped to contain tail risks, improve financial market conditions and sustain recovery, still remains in a challenging phase, with downside risks, including high volatility in global markets, high unemployment, particularly among young people, indebtedness in some countries and widespread fiscal strains, which pose challenges for global economic recovery and reflect the need for additional progress towards sustaining and rebalancing global demand, and stressing the need for continuing efforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances and to reform and strengthen the international financial system while implementing the reforms agreed upon to date,
	Recalling the resolve of Member States to enhance and strengthen domestic resource mobilization and fiscal space, including, where appropriate, through modernized tax systems, more efficient tax collection, the broadening of the tax base and the effective combating of tax evasion and capital flight, and reiterating that, while each country is responsible for its tax system, it is important to support national efforts in these areas by strengthening technical assistance and enhancing international cooperation and participation in addressing international tax matters,
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General;5
	2.	Acknowledges the efforts made and successes achieved by many middle-income countries to eradicate poverty and achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, as well as their significant contribution to global and regional development and economic stability;

	4.	Acknowledges that identifying structural gaps can improve the understanding of development needs of developing countries, including middle-income countries;
	5.	Requests the United Nations development system to ensure that it addresses the diverse development needs of middle-income countries in a coordinated manner through, inter alia, an accurate assessment of the national priorities and needs of these countries, taking into account the use of variables that go beyond per capita income criteria;
	6.	Also requests the United Nations development system, in particular the funds and programmes, in accordance with their respective mandates, and in the context of their respective strategic frameworks and within their existing budgets, to provide better focused support to middle-income countries and to improve coordination and exchange of experiences with other international organizations, international financial institutions and regional organizations in this field, as appropriate;
	7.	Welcomes the solidarity of middle-income countries with other developing countries, in particular the financial, technical, technology transfer and capacity-building support being provided by middle-income countries, particularly to the least developed countries, through South-South cooperation and triangular cooperation, while stressing that South-South cooperation is a complement to, and not a substitute for, North-South cooperation, and in this regard calls upon the United Nations development system to continue its ongoing efforts to mainstream support to South-South cooperation and triangular cooperation;
	8.	Encourages developed countries, and developing countries declaring themselves in a position to do so, to take steps towards the goal of realizing the timely implementation of duty-free and quota-free market access on a lasting basis for all least developed countries, consistent with the Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration adopted by the World Trade Organization in 2005;
	9.	Recognizes the importance of the private sector as well as the role of public-private partnerships in meeting the challenges of sustainable development for middle-income countries and other developing countries;
	10.	Also recognizes that middle-income countries still face significant challenges in their efforts to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and in that regard underlines the importance of international support, through various forms, that is well aligned with national priorities to address the development needs of middle-income countries, including through capacity-building;
	11.	Acknowledges that official development assistance is still essential for a number of middle-income countries and that it has a role to play in targeted areas, taking into account the needs and domestic resources of these countries;

	14.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its seventieth session a report on the implementation of the present resolution that also looks further into the development challenges of middle-income countries, including through, inter alia, measurements that take into account the multidimensional nature of poverty and development, and that provides recommendations and proposals to ensure efficient, effective, better focused and better coordinated cooperation with middle-income countries, and decides to include in its provisional agenda, under the item entitled "Globalization and interdependence", the sub-item entitled "Development cooperation with middle-income countries".

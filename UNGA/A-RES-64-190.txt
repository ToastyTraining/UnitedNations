	21.	Invites the international financial and banking institutions to enhance the transparency of risk-rating mechanisms, noting that sovereign risk assessments made by the private sector should maximize the use of strict, objective and transparent parameters, which can be facilitated by high-quality data and analysis, and encourages relevant development institutions, including the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, to continue their work on this issue, including its potential impact on the development prospects of developing countries;

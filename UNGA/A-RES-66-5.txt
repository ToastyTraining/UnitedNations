	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 64/4 of 19 October 2009, in which it decided to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-sixth session the sub-item entitled "Building a peaceful and better world through sport and the Olympic ideal", and recalling also its prior decision to consider the sub-item every two years, in advance of each Summer and Winter Olympic Games, 
	Recalling also its resolution 48/11 of 25 October 1993, which, inter alia, revived the ancient Greek tradition of ekecheiria ("Olympic Truce") calling for a truce during the Olympic Games that would encourage a peaceful environment and ensure the safe passage and participation of athletes and relevant persons at the Games, thereby mobilizing the youth of the world to the cause of peace,
	Recalling further that the core concept of ekecheiria, historically, was the cessation of hostilities from seven days before until seven days after the Olympic Games, which, according to the legendary oracle of Delphi, was to replace the cycle of conflict with a friendly athletic competition every four years,
	Reaffirming the value of sport in promoting education, health, development and peace,
	Recalling the inclusion in the United Nations Millennium Declaration1 of an appeal for the observance of the Olympic Truce now and in the future and for support for the International Olympic Committee in its efforts to promote peace and human understanding through sport and the Olympic ideal,

	Recalling the articles on leisure, recreation, sport and play of relevant international conventions, including article 30 of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities2 recognizing the right of persons with disabilities to take part on an equal basis with others in cultural life, recreation, leisure and sport, and noting that the 1948 Olympic Games, held in London, inspired the staging of the first organized sporting event for patients with spinal cord injuries, in Stoke Mandeville, near London, heralding the birth of a new global sporting movement for athletes with disabilities; the establishment of the Paralympic Games; and plans to stage integrated and inclusive Games for Everyone in 2012, 
	Recalling also that the main themes of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in London in 2012 are to host genuinely sustainable Games that deliver long-term social, economic, environmental and sporting benefits, helping to promote more stable, inclusive and peaceful communities and urban regeneration, addressing climate change, enhancing international relations and cooperation, and changing attitudes towards disability; and to inspire young people around the world to enrich their lives through sport, for example through the introduction of International Inspiration, the London 2012 international legacy programme,

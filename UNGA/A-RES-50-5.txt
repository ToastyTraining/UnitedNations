	ANNEX

Declaration in Commemoration of the Fiftieth Anniversary of the End of the Second World War

1.	We, the representatives of the States Members of the United Nations, have gathered at a solemn meeting of the fiftieth anniversary session of the United Nations General Assembly to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Second World War, which brought untold suffering and ravages to humankind.




2.	In this World Year of Peoples' Commemoration of the Victims of the Second World War, we bow our heads before the tens of millions who perished in their towns and villages or on the battlefields, or became victims of genocide in the death camps, and remember with gratitude those who fought against dictatorship, oppression, racism and aggression.

3.	We note that one of the most remarkable results of the end of the Second World War was the establishment of a community based on new principles - the United Nations, whose task is to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.  We reaffirm the resolve of our States to adhere strictly to the purposes and principles of the Charter of the United Nations and of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. 1/

4.	We note with satisfaction that today, now that many ideological barriers have fallen and the "cold war" has ended, new opportunities are emerging for building a non-violent world and a system of genuine global security with the United Nations as the central element.

5.	We recall the tragedy of the Second World War and the unprecedented suffering it inflicted upon various peoples and upon all of humanity.  We are fully aware of the vital necessity of making all possible efforts to put an end to existing armed conflicts, to avert such conflicts in the future and to overcome the remaining legacies of the Second World War as well as the manifestations of political, economic and social inequality, and we call upon the States of the world:

	(a)	To reaffirm the commitment to refrain from the use or threat of use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any State or in any other manner inconsistent with the principles and purposes of the Charter of the United Nations;

	(b)	To redouble their efforts to put an end to all conflicts and to save future generations from the scourge of new wars, inter alia, by drawing the lessons that emerge from the history of past conflicts;

	(c)	To promote democracy and human rights and to support universal access to culture;

	(d)	To focus their efforts on the objective of creating conditions for the general progress of humankind in larger freedom.

6.	The fulfilment of these commitments will be the best way to pay tribute to those who fought for peace, freedom, democracy and human dignity and to honour the memory of the victims of the Second World War.  Only in this way can we prevent new tragedies and ensure that all nations become a single community living in peace, stability, cooperation and prosperity.
     1/	Resolution 217 A (III).

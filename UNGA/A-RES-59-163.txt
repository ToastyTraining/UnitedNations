	The General Assembly,
	Recalling the United Nations Millennium Declaration,1 its resolution 58/141 of 22 December 2003 and its other previous resolutions,
	Reaffirming its commitment to the outcome of the twentieth special session of the General Assembly, devoted to countering the world drug problem together, held in New York from 8 to 10 June 1998, and welcoming the continuing determination of Governments to overcome the world drug problem by a full and balanced application of national, regional and international strategies to reduce the demand for, production of and trafficking in illicit drugs,
	Reaffirming the importance of the commitments of Member States in meeting the objectives targeted for 2003 and 2008, as set out in the Political Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at the twentieth special session,2 and welcoming the guidelines and elements recommended by the Commission on Narcotic Drugs to the Executive Director of the United Nations International Drug Control Programme for the preparation of subsequent reports on the follow-up to the twentieth special session,3
	Emphasizing the importance of the Action Plan4 for the Implementation of the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction,5 which introduces a new global approach balanced between illicit supply and demand reduction, under the principle of shared responsibility, and of the Action Plan on International Cooperation on the Eradication of Illicit Drug Crops and on Alternative Development,6 which recognizes the importance of supply reduction as an integral part of a balanced drug control strategy,
	Recognizing the efforts of all countries, in particular those that produce narcotic drugs for scientific and medical purposes, and of the International Narcotics Control Board in preventing the diversion of such substances to illicit markets and in maintaining production at a level consistent with licit demand, in line with the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 19617 and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971,8
	Aware that progress has been uneven in meeting the goals set in the Political Declaration, as also reflected in the biennial reports of the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime,9 and recognizing that the drug problem is still a global challenge that constitutes a serious threat to public health and safety and the well-being of humankind, in particular children and young people, and that it undermines socio-economic and political stability and sustainable development, including efforts to reduce poverty, and causes violence and crime, including in urban areas,
	Concerned by the increase in the abuse of illicit drugs among children, including adolescents, and young people,
	Concerned also by the challenges posed by links between the spread of HIV/AIDS and injecting drug use,
	Concerned further by the serious challenges and threats posed by the continuing links between illicit drug trafficking and terrorism and other national and transnational criminal activities, such as trafficking in human beings, especially women and children, money-laundering, corruption, trafficking in arms and trafficking in chemical precursors, and reaffirming that strong and effective international cooperation is needed to counter these threats,
	Concerned about policies and activities in favour of the legalization of illicit narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances that are not in accordance with the international drug control treaties and that might jeopardize the international drug control regime,
	Concerned also by the increase in the diversion of chemical precursors used in the illicit manufacture of drugs,
	Acknowledging that international cooperation in countering drug abuse and illicit production and trafficking has shown that positive results can be achieved through sustained and collective efforts, and expressing its appreciation for the initiatives in this regard,

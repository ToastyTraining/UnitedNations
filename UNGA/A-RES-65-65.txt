	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 48/75 L of 16 December 1993, 53/77 I of 4 December 1998, 55/33 Y of 20 November 2000, 56/24 J of 29 November 2001, 57/80 of 22 November 2002, 58/57 of 8 December 2003, 59/81 of 3 December 2004 and 64/29 of 2 December 2009 on the subject of banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices, and noting in this regard the support for the Conference on Disarmament expressed by the Security Council summit on nuclear disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, held on 24 September 2009,
	Convinced that a non-discriminatory, multilateral and internationally and effectively verifiable treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices would be a significant contribution to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation,
	Welcoming, after years of stalemate, the consensus adoption by the Conference on Disarmament of its decision (CD/1864) of 29 May 2009 on the establishment of a programme of work for its 2009 session, by which the Conference, inter alia, and without prejudice to any past, present or future position, established a Working Group to negotiate a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of document CD/1299 of 24 March 1995 and the mandate contained therein, 
	1.	Urges the Conference on Disarmament to agree early in 2011 on a programme of work that includes the immediate commencement of negotiations on a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices;
	2.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-sixth session the item entitled "Treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices".

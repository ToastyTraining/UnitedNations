	B

	Expansion of the membership of the Conference on Disarmament

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Conference on Disarmament, 4/

	Conscious of the need for a comprehensive approach to the disarmament process and for improved functioning and efficiency of the multilateral arms control and disarmament machinery, as also envisaged in the report of the Secretary-General on new dimensions of arms regulation and disarmament in the post-cold-war era, 5/

	Recalling its relevant resolutions, in particular resolution 48/77 B of 16 December 1993, concerning, inter alia, the ongoing review by the Conference on Disarmament of its agenda, composition and methods of work, which highlighted the need for substantial enlargement of the present membership of the Conference,

	Fully convinced that an enlarged membership is desirable in order to take advantage of the current propitious international climate to negotiate, on the solid basis of a more representative participation, a comprehensive test-ban treaty and other important agreements requiring universal adherence,

	Recalling that the Conference on Disarmament, which is funded from the regular budget, was granted, pursuant to resolution 48/77 B, supplementary administrative, substantive and conference support services, inter alia, in anticipation of its expansion,

	Recalling also its resolution 1722 (XVI) of 20 December 1961 regarding the establishment of the Conference on Disarmament, then the Eighteen-Nation Committee on Disarmament,

	Emphasizing the fact that, notwithstanding dramatic changes in the international situation and continuous consultations, there has been no expansion of the membership of the Conference during the last fifteen years,

	Welcoming the fact that the annual report of the Conference on Disarmament reflects the intention of the Conference to reinstate its own procedures providing for periodic review of its composition,

	Regretting, however, that the Conference on Disarmament did not reach a consensus that would result in the expansion of its membership before the start of the 1994 session of the Conference, as urged by the General Assembly in its resolution 48/77 B, nor was it able to resolve this question thereafter, in spite of intensive efforts by the Friend of the Chair,

	1.	Recognizes the legitimate aspirations of the candidate countries to participate fully in the work of the Conference on Disarmament;

	2.	Recalls the report of 12 August 1993 of the Special Coordinator for membership designated by the Conference on Disarmament 6/ and the subsequent statement made by the Special Coordinator on 26 August 1993, 7/ recommending a dynamic solution to the question of membership, as well as the report of the Conference on Disarmament on its 1994 session;

	3.	Urges the Conference on Disarmament to make every effort to reach a solution resulting, by the beginning of 1995, in a significant expansion of its composition, which would then include at least sixty countries.

	C

	Report of the Conference on Disarmament

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the report of the Conference on Disarmament, 4/

	Convinced that the Conference on Disarmament, as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community, has the primary role in substantive negotiations on priority questions of disarmament,

	Considering, in this respect, that the present international climate should give additional impetus to multilateral negotiations with the aim of reaching concrete agreements,

	Welcoming the ongoing negotiations of the Conference on Disarmament on a comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty,

	Noting with satisfaction the results achieved so far on the subject of improved and effective functioning of the Conference on Disarmament, as well as the decision to carry out consultations with a view to achieving consensus on the issue of its membership by the beginning of its 1995 session and the decision to continue consultations on the issue of the agenda at its 1995 session,

	Recognizing that the Conference on Disarmament has a number of urgent and important areas for negotiations,

	1.	Reaffirms the role of the Conference on Disarmament as the single multilateral disarmament negotiating forum of the international community;

	2.	Welcomes the determination of the Conference on Disarmament to fulfil that role in the light of the evolving international situation, with a view to making early substantive progress on priority items of its agenda;

	5.	Urges the Conference on Disarmament to make every effort to reach a solution on the expansion of its membership by the beginning of its 1995 session;

	D

	Implementation of the guidelines for appropriate types of
	confidence-building measures

	The General Assembly,

	Recalling its resolution 43/78 H of 7 December 1988, in which it endorsed the guidelines for appropriate types of confidence-building measures and for the implementation of such measures on a global or regional level, and its resolution 47/54 D, adopted without a vote on 9 December 1992,

	Noting that since then national reports on the implementation of the guidelines for appropriate types of confidence-building measures have been submitted by a number of Member States belonging to different geographic regions,

	Reconfirming its support for the guidelines for appropriate types of confidence-building measures and for the implementation of such measures on a global or regional level,

	Recalling that the guidelines and recommendations for regional approaches to disarmament within the context of global security, as endorsed by the General Assembly at its forty-eighth session, refer, inter alia, to confidence- and security-building measures in the context of maintaining and enhancing regional peace and security,

 	Welcoming progress at the global level in the promotion of transparency in the military field as a cornerstone for confidence-building, through the United Nations system for the standardized reporting of military expenditures, introduced by its resolution 35/142 B of 12 December 1980, the endorsement of the guidelines and recommendations for objective information on military matters, contained in its resolution 47/54 B of 9 December 1992, and the establishment of the Register of Conventional Arms under its resolution 46/36 L of 9 December 1991,

	Noting with satisfaction the encouraging results of specific confidence-building measures agreed upon and implemented in some regions which foster mutual trust and understanding, defuse tensions and promote friendly relations among States,

	Welcoming, in particular, the establishment of regional mechanisms, institutions or forums entrusted with the prevention and peaceful settlement of conflicts, and the development of confidence-building measures,

	Recognizing the value of regional workshops, seminars and conferences on regional confidence-building and security, contributing to regional disarmament and security,


	Reaffirming the great importance of increasing security and stability in all regions through appropriate measures to strengthen international peace and security,


	Realizing with deep concern, however, that tensions in some regions rise and that even violent armed conflicts have erupted and continue, in some cases, despite all peacemaking and peace-keeping efforts,

	Emphasizing that confidence-building measures, especially when applied in a comprehensive manner, can be conducive to achieving structures of security based on cooperation and openness and thus contribute to the wider objective of the renunciation of the threat or use of force, 

	1.	Stresses the need for the development and implementation of confidence-building measures as a concrete means to facilitate the disarmament and arms limitation process and to improve the prospects for the peaceful settlement of disputes, thus contributing to maintaining and enhancing regional and international peace and security;

	2.	Recommends the guidelines for appropriate types of confidence-building measures to all States for implementation, taking fully into account the specific political, military and other conditions prevailing in a region;

	3.	Also recommends to all States and regions that have already started to implement confidence-building measures to pursue further and strengthen this process;

	4.	Appeals to all States to consider the widest possible use of confidence-building measures in their international relations, including bilateral, regional and global activities, as an important step towards prevention of conflict and, in times of political tension and crisis, as an instrument for peaceful settlement of conflicts;


	5.	Calls upon, in particular, all States in whose regions military tensions exist, or armed conflicts occur, to make the best possible use of confidence-building measures, among other appropriate activities and if needed in cooperation with other States, to ease tensions and to contribute to peacemaking and peace-building;

	6.	Invites the Secretary-General to continue to collect relevant information from all Member States;

	7.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-first session an item entitled "Confidence-building measures".

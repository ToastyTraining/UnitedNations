Government-provided personnel
	22.	Reiterates its request contained in paragraph 65 of its resolution 67/255, notes that, while the government-provided personnel modality is aimed at facilitating the rapid deployment of specialized capabilities for short-term requirements or capabilities generally found only in national Governments, its use is not a substitute for staff, and requests the Secretary-General to ensure that the use of the government-provided personnel modality is in line with relevant results-based budgeting frameworks and to provide justification when deployment of government-provided personnel is envisaged beyond one year;

	Emphasizing that States should continue to adopt legislation, in accordance with their international human rights obligations and commitments, which addresses the issue of violence against women in a comprehensive manner by not only criminalizing violence against women and girls and providing for punishment of the perpetrators, but also including protection and preventive measures, with provisions for adequate funding for their implementation,

Strongly condemns all acts of violence against women and girls, whether those acts are perpetrated by the State, by private persons or by non-State actors, including business enterprises, and calls for the elimination of all forms of gender-based violence in the family, within the general community and where perpetrated or condoned by the State;

Stresses that it is important that States strongly condemn all forms of violence against women and refrain from invoking any custom, tradition or religious consideration to avoid their obligations with respect to its elimination as set out in the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women;9
	11.	Also stresses that States have the obligation, at all levels, to promote and protect all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, including women and girls, and must exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate, prosecute and punish the perpetrators of violence against women and girls and eliminate impunity and should ensure protection, including adequate enforcement by police and the judiciary of civil remedies, orders of protection and criminal sanctions, and provision of shelters, psychosocial services, counselling and other types of support services, in order to avoid revictimization, and that to do so contributes to the enjoyment of human rights and fundamental freedoms by women subjected to violence;
	12.	Reaffirms that the persistence of armed conflicts in various parts of the world is a major impediment to the elimination of all forms of violence against women, and, bearing in mind that armed and other types of conflicts and terrorism and hostage-taking still persist in many parts of the world and that aggression, foreign occupation and ethnic and other types of conflicts are an ongoing reality, affecting women and men in nearly every region, calls upon all States and the international community to place particular focus on the plight, and give priority attention and increased assistance to relieving the suffering, of women and girls living in such situations and to ensure that, where violence is committed against them, all perpetrators of such violence are duly investigated and, as appropriate, prosecuted and punished in order to end impunity, while stressing the need to respect international humanitarian law and human rights law;
	13.	Stresses the need for the exclusion of killing and maiming of women and girls, as prohibited under international law, and crimes of sexual violence from amnesty provisions in the context of conflict resolution processes and to address such acts during all stages of the armed-conflict and post-conflict resolution process, while ensuring the full and effective participation of women in such processes;
	14.	Also stresses that, despite important steps taken by many countries around the world, States should continue to focus on the prevention of violence against women as well as on their protection and the provision of services, in order to complement more effectively the improved legal and policy frameworks, and should therefore monitor and rigorously evaluate the implementation of available programmes, policies and laws and improve, where possible, their impact and effectiveness;
	15.

	Recognizing that the magnitude of the disaster and its medium- and long-term effects will require, as a complement to the efforts already being made by the Governments and peoples of Haiti, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and other affected countries, a demonstration of international solidarity and humanitarian concern to ensure more broad-based and adequate multilateral cooperation in order to meet the immediate emergency situation in the affected areas and initiate the process of reconstruction,

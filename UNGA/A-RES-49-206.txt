	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the Third Committee (A/49/610/Add.3)]


		49/206.Situation of human rights in Rwanda


	The General Assembly,

	Guided by the Charter of the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1/ the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, 2/ the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, 2/ the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, 3/ and other applicable human rights and humanitarian law instruments,

	Recalling Commission on Human Rights resolution S-3/1 of 25 May 1994, 4/ by which the Commission established a Special Rapporteur to investigate the human rights situation in Rwanda,

	Recalling the establishment of the Commission of Experts pursuant to Security Council resolution 935 (1994) of 1 July 1994 to report on grave violations of international humanitarian law in Rwanda,

	Deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the Commission of Experts that genocide and systematic, widespread and flagrant violations of international humanitarian law and crimes against humanity have been committed in Rwanda, resulting in massive loss of life,

	Also deeply concerned by the reports of the Special Rapporteur and the Commission of Experts that the situation of ethnic and political armed conflict in Rwanda resulted in other grave violations and abuses of human rights, including violation of the right to life, the right to physical and moral integrity, the right to be free from torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment and the right to be free from discrimination on the grounds of ethnic origin and to be protected from incitement to such discrimination,

	Reaffirming the deep concern expressed by the World Conference on Human Rights about violations of human rights during armed conflicts affecting the civilian population, especially women, children, the elderly and the disabled, 5/

	Noting that, following the cease-fire of 18 July 1994, a new Government of Rwanda has been established and has made efforts to restore the rule of law and reconstruct the civil administration and the social, legal, physical, economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda after the extensive damage inflicted by the civil conflict,

	Noting with concern that, in spite of efforts by the Government of Rwanda to ensure peace and security and the rule of law, a situation of insecurity still exists, evidenced by reports of disappearances, arbitrary arrest and detention, summary executions and destruction of property, and welcoming the commitments of the Government of Rwanda to protect and promote respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and to eliminate impunity by investigating and prosecuting those responsible for acts of retribution,

	Concerned about the danger posed by continuing incidences of violence and intolerance in Rwanda, which impede the full realization of civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights,

	Also concerned about the fact that these occurrences create a climate of insecurity, which prevents refugees and displaced persons from returning to their homes, conscious that the return to their homes is essential for the normalization of the situation in Rwanda and countries of the region, and concerned, in addition, about reports of continuing acts of intimidation and violence within the camps for refugees, particularly by the former Rwandese authorities, which prevent refugees from returning home,

	Conscious that technical assistance and advisory services will assist the Government of Rwanda in reconstructing the social, legal, physical, economic and human rights infrastructure of Rwanda,

	Further concerned by the ongoing interference, particularly by the former Rwandese authorities, in the provision of humanitarian relief, which has already led to the withdrawal of some non-governmental agencies responsible for the distribution of relief supplies within the camps outside Rwanda,

	Noting with appreciation the efforts of the Secretary-General, his Special Representative for Rwanda, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the Department of Humanitarian Affairs of the Secretariat and non-governmental organizations, as well as of the Commission on Human Rights and its special rapporteurs,

	Commending the initiatives taken by the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, including his timely visits to Rwanda, and welcoming his efforts to ensure that the Special Rapporteur is assisted by a team of human rights field officers acting in close cooperation with the United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda and other United Nations agencies and programmes operating in Rwanda, and his efforts to facilitate coordination and cooperation between the work of the Commission of Experts and the Special Rapporteur,

	Conscious of the important role human rights field officers will have in establishing an environment conducive to full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and in preventing further violations, mindful of the need for the speedy deployment of a sufficient number of such officers to fulfil this role and endorsing the Secretary-General's encouragement to Member States to provide contributions to expand human rights activities in the field,

	Stressing the need for the implementation by all parties in Rwanda of the principles contained in the Peace Agreement between the Government of the Rwandese Republic and the Rwandese Patriotic Front, signed at Arusha on 4 August 1993, 6/ which constitutes the framework for peace, national reconciliation and unity in Rwanda, and noting with appreciation the efforts of the Chairman and Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity, the President of the United Republic of Tanzania, Mr. Ali Hassan Mwinyi, in his capacity as the Facilitator of the Arusha peace process,

	Recalling Security Council resolution 965 (1994) of 30 November 1994, in which the Council expanded the mandate of the Assistance Mission to contribute to the security and protection of displaced persons, refugees and civilians at risk in Rwanda, to provide security and support for the distribution of relief supplies and humanitarian relief operations, to contribute to the security in Rwanda of personnel of the International Tribunal for Rwanda and human rights officers, and to assist in the training of a new integrated police force, and recalling also the Secretary-General's revised deployment schedule for the Assistance Mission, which is intended to promote security in all areas of the country and create conditions conducive to the return of refugees,

	Conscious of the fact that the magnitude of the tragedy in Rwanda requires the kind of coordination and resources that can be effectively sustained by the United Nations, and supporting the Secretary-General's encouragement, under the Rwanda Emergency Normalization Plan, to States Members of the United Nations, United Nations agencies and non-governmental organizations to provide immediate and coordinated technical and financial assistance to Rwanda,

	Recognizing that effective action to prevent further violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms must be a central and integral element of the overall United Nations response to the situation in Rwanda,

	Recognizing also that a strong human rights component is indispensable to the political peace process and the post-conflict reconstruction of Rwanda,

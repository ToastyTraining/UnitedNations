	Expressing concern that, after the First United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (1997-2006) and midway to the 2015 Millennium Development Goals target date, while there has been progress in reducing poverty in some regions, this progress has been uneven and the number of people living in poverty in some countries continues to increase, with women and children constituting the majority of the most affected groups, especially in the least developed countries and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, 
	Recognizing that rates of economic growth vary between countries and that these differences must be addressed by, among other actions, promoting pro-poor growth and social protection,

	Expressing concern that the number of people living in poverty is higher than previously estimated,5 despite significant progress, and that the current financial and food insecurity crises and unpredictable energy prices may pose significant challenges for the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, 
	Recognizing that mobilizing financial resources for development at the national and international levels and the effective use of those resources are central to a global partnership for development in support of the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, 
	Recognizing also the contributions of South-South and triangular cooperation to the efforts of developing countries to eradicate poverty and to pursue sustainable development, 
	Acknowledging that good governance at national and international levels and sustained and inclusive economic growth, supported by full employment and decent work, rising productivity, and a favourable environment, including public and private investment and entrepreneurship, are necessary to eradicate poverty, achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and realize a rise in living standards, and that corporate social responsibility initiatives play an important role in maximizing the impact of public and private investment,

	3.	Also reaffirms that each country must take primary responsibility for its own development and that the role of national policies and strategies cannot be overemphasized in the achievement of sustainable development and poverty eradication, and recognizes that increased effective national efforts should be complemented by concrete, effective and supportive international programmes, measures and policies aimed at expanding the development opportunities of developing countries, while taking into account national conditions and ensuring respect for national ownership, strategies and sovereignty;

	8.	Calls upon the international community to continue to give priority to the eradication of poverty and on donor countries in a position to do so to support the effective national efforts of developing countries in this regard, through adequate predictable financial resources on either a bilateral or a multilateral basis; 
	9.	Acknowledges efforts of developed countries to increase their assistance for development, including commitments by some developed countries to increase official development assistance; notes with concern, however, the overall decline in official development assistance in 2006 and 2007, and calls for the fulfilment of all official development assistance-related commitments, including the commitments made by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance by 2015 and to reach the target of at least 0.5 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance by 2010, as well as to achieve the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of gross national product for official development assistance to least developed countries; and urges those developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete efforts in this regard in accordance with their commitments;
	10.	Welcomes recent efforts and initiatives to enhance the quality of aid and to increase its impact, including the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness and the Accra Agenda for Action,7 and the resolve to take concrete, effective and timely action in implementing all agreed commitments on aid effectiveness, with clear monitoring and deadlines, including through further aligning assistance with countries' strategies, building institutional capacities, reducing transaction costs and eliminating bureaucratic procedures, making progress on untying aid, enhancing the absorptive capacity and financial management of recipient countries and strengthening the focus on development results;
	11.	Recognizes that sustained and inclusive economic growth is essential for eradicating poverty and hunger, in particular in developing countries, and stresses that national efforts in this regard should be complemented by an enabling international environment;
	12.	Also recognizes that, for developing countries to reach the targets set in the context of national development strategies for the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, in particular the goal on the eradication of extreme poverty, and for such poverty eradication strategies to be effective, it is imperative that developing countries increase their efforts to be integrated into the world economy in order to share the benefits of globalization;
	13.	Requests the Secretary-General to appoint a focal point from within the United Nations system to coordinate the implementation of the Second United Nations Decade in close consultation with Member States;

	15.	Recognizes the need to give the highest priority to its consideration of the item on poverty eradication in its agenda, and in that regard, as a contribution to the Second United Nations Decade, decides to convene, during its sixty-eighth session, a meeting of the General Assembly at the highest appropriate political level centred on the review process devoted to the theme for the issue of poverty eradication, and stresses that the meeting and the preparatory activities should be carried out within the budget level proposed by the Secretary-General for the biennium 2012-2013 and should be organized in the most effective and efficient manner;

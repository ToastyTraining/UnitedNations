	6.	Calls upon the United Nations Population Fund, in consultation with Member States and in cooperation with all relevant organizations of the United Nations system and other relevant international organizations, as well as institutions and experts, to undertake an operational review of the implementation of the Programme of Action on the basis of the highest-quality data and analysis of the state of population and development and taking into account the need for a systematic, comprehensive and integrated approach to population and development issues, and requests the Secretary-General to submit a report based on this review to the Commission on Population and Development at its forty-seventh session;

Funding of operational activities of the United Nations for development
A.	General principles
	24.	Stresses the need for adequate quantity and quality of funding for operational activities as well as the need to make funding more predictable, effective and efficient; 
	25.	Emphasizes that increasing financial contributions to the United Nations development system, in particular core resources, is key to achieving the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, and in this regard recognizes the mutually reinforcing links between increased effectiveness, efficiency and coherence of the United Nations development system, achieving concrete results in assisting developing countries to eradicate poverty and achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development through its operational activities for development and the overall resourcing of the United Nations development system; 
	26.	Stresses that core resources, because of their untied nature, continue to be the bedrock of the operational activities for development of the United Nations system, in this regard notes with concern that the share of core contributions to United Nations funds and programmes has declined in recent years, and recognizes the need for organizations to address, on a continuous basis, the imbalance between core and non-core resources; 
	27.	Notes that non-core resources represent an important contribution to the overall resource base of the United Nations development system and complement core resources to support operational activities for development, thus contributing to an increase in total resources, while noting the need to make non-core resources more flexible and aligned with strategic plans and national priorities and recognizing that non-core resources are not a substitute for core resources; 
	28.	Recognizes that non-core resources pose challenges, in particular restricted earmarked funding such as single-donor project-specific funding, through potentially increasing transaction costs, fragmentation, competition and overlap among entities and providing disincentives for pursuing a United Nations-wide focus, strategic positioning and coherence, and may also potentially distort programme priorities regulated by intergovernmental bodies and processes; 
	29.	Also recognizes the overall positive trends of funding for United Nations operational activities in the period from 1995 to 2010, and notes with concern the decline in official development assistance in 2011 as well as the imbalance between core and non-core resources; 
	30.	Acknowledges the efforts by developed countries to increase resources for development, including commitments by some developed countries to increase official development assistance, calls for the fulfilment of all official development assistance commitments, including the commitments by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance by 2015, as well as the target of 0.15 per cent to 0.20 per cent for least developed countries, and urges those developed countries that have not yet done so to make concrete efforts in this regard in accordance with their commitments; 
	31.	Affirms the importance of accountability, transparency and improved results-based management and further harmonized results-based reporting on the work of the United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies, and in nationally owned outcomes, for increased quantity and quality of funding for operational activities; 
	32.	Encourages the funds, programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations development system to intensify collaboration to achieve more effective use of development resources, as well as their expertise and actions towards strengthening national capacities in accordance with national priorities and development plans;

	33.	Urges donor countries and other countries in a position to do so to maintain and substantially increase their voluntary contributions, in a manner consistent with their capacities, to the core/regular budgets of the United Nations development system, in particular its funds, programmes and specialized agencies, and to contribute on a multi-year basis, in a sustained and predictable manner; 
	34.	Stresses that funding for operational activities should be aligned with the national priorities and plans of the programme countries as well as the strategic plans, mandates, resource frameworks and priorities of the United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies, and underscores in that regard the need to further strengthen the delivery of results and the results-based frameworks of the funds, programmes and specialized agencies of the United Nations development system and to improve their reporting on outputs and nationally owned outcomes; 
	35.	Requests the United Nations funds and programmes, and encourages the specialized agencies, to report to their governing bodies at the first regular session of 2014 on concrete measures taken to emphasize the importance of broadening the donor base and increasing the number of countries and other partners making financial contributions to the United Nations development system in order to reduce the reliance of the system on a limited number of donors, as well as on progress made in increasing the donor base; 
	36.	Encourages the United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies to further improve their communication to the general public on their mandates and development results, recognizing the important contribution made by those Governments in providing significant core contributions to regular resources of those organizations, and invites the United Nations funds and programmes and specialized agencies to provide information on efforts made in communicating to the general public in their annual reports to the Economic and Social Council from 2013 onwards; 
	37.	Encourages the United Nations funds and programmes to continue to actively engage with the Bretton Woods institutions, the regional development banks, civil society, the private sector and foundations with a view to diversifying potential sources of funding, especially core funding, for their operational activities for development, in alignment with the core principles of the United Nations development system and with full respect for the national priorities of programme countries; 
	38.	Expresses concern over the lack of progress by the governing bodies in the development and operationalization of the concept of the "critical mass" of core resources; 
	39.	Reiterates the potential positive impact of determining the level of critical mass of core funding for United Nations development agencies, and requests the funds and programmes to define common principles for the concept of critical mass of core resources, which may include the level of resources adequate to respond to the needs of the programme countries and to produce the results expected in strategic plans, including administrative, management and programme costs, and to present specific proposals to their respective governing bodies by the end of 2013 with a view to a decision in 2014; 

C.	Improving the predictability and quality of resources
	40.	Recognizes that Member States and the United Nations development system should prioritize the allocation of core/regular resources and non-core resources that are more predictable, flexible, less earmarked and better aligned with the priorities of programme countries, including those included in the United Nations Development Assistance Framework, and with the strategic plans and mandates of United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies; 
	41.	Encourages the governing bodies of the United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies, as appropriate, to ensure that all available and projected core and non-core resources are consolidated within an integrated budgetary framework, based on the priorities of their respective strategic plans; 
	42.	Requests that, as a practice, all available and projected financial contributions for operational activities for development of the United Nations system at the country level be consolidated within a common budgetary framework, which would not constitute a legal constraint on the spending authority of resources, and that the framework be used to strengthen the quality of system-wide resource planning in support of the United Nations Development Assistance Framework, and also requests the funds and programmes, and encourages the specialized agencies, to provide the necessary information on contributions to the resident coordinators upon agreement with programme countries; 
	43.	Stresses the need to avoid the use of core/regular resources to subsidize non-core/extrabudgetary financed activities, including the use of core/regular resources to cover costs related to the management and support of non-core/extrabudgetary funds and their programme activities; 
	44.	Encourages Member States making non-core contributions to reduce transaction costs, assign resources, as much as possible, at the beginning of the annual planning period, while encouraging multi-year duration of implementation of development-related activities, streamline and harmonize requirements related to reporting, monitoring and evaluation and give priority to pooled, thematic and joint funding mechanisms applied at the global, regional and country levels; 
	45.	Acknowledges the ongoing work by the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Population Fund, the United Nations Children's Fund and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN-Women) towards agency-specific integrated budgets, including harmonization of cost classification, and looks forward to the completion of this work to allow a better alignment of programming and resources in the next generation of strategic plans;

	49.	Acknowledges the principle of full cost recovery; 
	50.	Also acknowledges that United Nations organizations have different business models and mandates and that this implies that their funding structures differ; 
	51.	Notes with concern that the non-programme costs relating to non-core programme activities continue to draw resources from core resources for programme activities; 
	52.	Urges Member States making non-core contributions to reduce transaction costs and to streamline reporting requirements, where possible; 
	53.	Requests the executive boards of the United Nations funds and programmes, and encourages the governing bodies of the specialized agencies, to adopt cost recovery frameworks by 2013, with a view to their full implementation in 2014, based on the guiding principle of full cost recovery, proportionally, from core and non-core resources, and a simple, transparent and harmonized methodology, providing incentives, including through differentiated cost recovery rates, and taking into account different volumes and nature of funds to increase core funding and more predictable, flexible and less earmarked non-core contributions that are aligned with the strategic plans adopted by the respective governing bodies; 
	54.	Requests the United Nations funds and programmes, and urges the specialized agencies, to include estimated amounts to be recovered in their budgets and to report on actual cost recovery amounts as part of their regular financial reporting;

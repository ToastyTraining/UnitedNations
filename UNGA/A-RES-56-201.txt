[on the report of the Second Committee (A/56/562/Add.1)]

56/201.	Triennial policy review of operational activities for development of the United Nations system


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 44/211 of 22 December 1989, 47/199 of 22 December 1992, 50/120 of 20 December 1995, 52/203 of 18 December 1997, 52/12 B of 19 December 1997 and 53/192 of 15 December 1998, as well as Economic and Social Council resolutions 1999/5 and 1999/6 of 23 July 1999, and 2000/19 and 2000/20 of 28 July 2000, and taking note of agreed conclusions 2001/1 of the Council of 4 July 2001,1 the ministerial declaration of the high-level segment of the substantive session of the Council of 18 July 2001,2 Council resolution 2001/41 of 26 July 2001 and other relevant resolutions,
	Recalling also the United Nations Millennium Declaration of 8 September 20003 and its importance for international development cooperation, including the operational activities for development of the United Nations system, and in particular the development and poverty eradication goals and targets contained therein,
	Reaffirming that the operational activities for development of the United Nations system have an important role to play in enabling developing countries to continue to take a lead role in the management of their own development process in a continuously changing global context,
	Reaffirming also that the fundamental characteristics of the operational activities of the United Nations system should be, inter alia, their universal, voluntary and grant nature, their neutrality and their multilateralism, as well as their ability to respond to the development needs of developing countries in a flexible manner, and that the operational activities of the United Nations system are carried out for the benefit of recipient countries, at the request of those countries and in accordance with their own policies and priorities for development,
	Stressing that national plans and priorities constitute the only viable frame of reference for the national programming of operational activities for development of the United Nations system and that programmes should be based on such development plans and priorities and should therefore be country-driven,
	Bearing in mind that the effectiveness of operational activities should be assessed by their impact on poverty eradication, economic growth and sustainable development of recipient countries as set out in the commitments, goals and targets of the Millennium Declaration and of the major United Nations conferences,
	Welcoming the efforts undertaken so far to rationalize and improve the functioning and impact of United Nations funds, programmes and specialized agencies,

	Recognizing also that new technologies, including information and communication technologies, present an opportunity to accelerate development, especially in developing countries, but that the access to those technologies is uneven and that a digital divide still prevails,
	Noting that, while the scope of operational activities of the organizations of the United Nations system includes situations where a more flexible response capacity of the system is required, the focus of operational activities should be on actions that have a long-term impact on poverty eradication, economic growth and sustainable development,
	Recognizing the urgent and specific needs of low-income countries, in particular the least developed countries,
	Emphasizing that developing countries are responsible for their development processes, and in this context stressing the responsibility of the international community, in partnership, to assist developing countries in their national development efforts,
	Recognizing that the United Nations development system should take into account the specific needs and requirements of the countries with economies in transition and other recipient countries,
	Recalling the role of the Economic and Social Council in providing coordination and guidance to the United Nations system to ensure that policies formulated by the General Assembly, in particular during the triennial policy review of operational activities, are implemented on a system-wide basis in accordance with Assembly resolutions 48/162 of 20 December 1993 and 50/227 of 24 May 1996,

	8.	Also stresses that the United Nations development system should assist programme countries in addressing the goals and targets identified in the Millennium Declaration and in the outcomes and commitments of relevant major United Nations conferences, in the context of the current challenges and opportunities of globalization;

	15.	Strongly reaffirms that the impact of operational activities for development of the United Nations system must be enhanced by, inter alia, a substantial increase in core or regular resources on a predictable, continuous and sustained basis, commensurate with the increasing needs of developing countries, as well as through the full implementation of resolutions 47/199, 48/162, 50/120, 53/192 and the parts relevant to operational activities for development of resolution 52/12 B;

	21.

	22.	Reaffirms the need for priority allocation of scarce grant resources to programmes and projects in low-income countries, in particular the least developed countries;
	23.	Requests that the establishment of new trust funds by United Nations funds and programmes be done in accordance with their mandates, mission statements and the relevant decisions of their governing bodies, and that such new trust funds, to the extent possible, be multi-donor in nature and not detrimental to core or regular resources;

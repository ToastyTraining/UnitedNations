[on the report of the Second Committee (A/68/440/Add.1)]
68/219.	Role of the United Nations in promoting development in the context of globalization and interdependence
	The General Assembly, 
	Recalling its resolutions 62/199 of 19 December 2007, 63/222 of 19 December 2008, 64/210 of 21 December 2009, 65/168 of 20 December 2010 and 66/210 of 22 December 2011 on the role of the United Nations in promoting development in the context of globalization and interdependence,
	Acknowledging the vital importance of an inclusive, transparent and effective multilateral system in order to address the urgent global challenges of today, recognizing the universality of the United Nations, and reaffirming its commitment to promote and strengthen the effectiveness and efficiency of the United Nations, 
	Reaffirming the role and authority of the General Assembly on global matters of concern to the international community, as set out in the Charter of the United Nations, 
	Acknowledging that the United Nations, particularly the General Assembly, provides a universal and inclusive multilateral forum which confers incomparable value to its discussions and its decisions on global matters of concern to the international community, 
	Recalling the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development and its outcome document, entitled "The future we want",1 and all major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social, environmental and related fields for the promotion of sustainable development and their outcomes and follow-up processes, 
	Recognizing that the international multilateral system should continue to support sustainable development, particularly in relation to inclusive and equitable economic growth, job creation and the efforts of developing countries to eradicate poverty and hunger and achieve environmental sustainability, and should continue to promote good governance and the rule of law at all levels, 
	Recognizing also that globalization and interdependence imply that the economic performance of a country is increasingly affected by factors outside its geographical borders, that maximizing the benefits of globalization in an equitable manner requires responses at the global, regional and national levels and that there remains a need for a strengthened global partnership for development to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, 
	Emphasizing that globalization is a useful tool for development that should benefit all countries and that every effort should be made by all to meaningfully integrate all countries into the global economy by creating an enabling international environment for their goods and services,
	Reaffirming its strong support for fair and inclusive globalization and the need to translate sustained, inclusive and equitable growth into sustainable development, particularly poverty eradication, and, in this regard, its resolve to make the goals of full and productive employment and decent work for all, including women and young people, a central objective of relevant national and international policies and national development strategies, including poverty eradication strategies, as part of efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, 
	Reaffirming also the commitment to eradicate poverty and hunger and promote sustained, inclusive and equitable growth, sustainable development and global prosperity for all and to promote the development of the productive sectors in developing countries to enable them to participate more effectively in and benefit from the process of globalization,
	Expressing deep concern about the ongoing adverse impacts of the world financial and economic crisis, particularly on development, recognizing evidence of an uneven and fragile recovery, cognizant that the global economy, notwithstanding significant efforts that helped to contain tail risks, improve financial market conditions and sustain recovery, still remains in a challenging phase, with downside risks, including high volatility in global markets, high unemployment, particularly among young people, indebtedness in some countries and widespread fiscal strains, which pose challenges for global economic recovery and reflect the need for additional progress towards sustaining and rebalancing global demand, and stressing the need for continuing efforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances and to reform and strengthen the international financial system, while implementing the reforms agreed upon to date, 
	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General,2 
	1.	Reiterates the need for inclusive, transparent and effective multilateral approaches to managing global challenges, and in this regard reaffirms the central role of the United Nations system in ongoing efforts to find common solutions to such challenges;
	2.	Recognizes the need for the multilateral trade, economic and financial architecture to incorporate and promote sustainable development and ensure greater coherence and coordination to promote an enabling international environment that facilitates the work of Member States in addressing, inter alia, poverty, inequalities and environmental challenges;
	3.	Reaffirms the need for the United Nations to play a fundamental role in the promotion of international cooperation for development and the coherence, coordination and implementation of development goals and actions agreed upon by the international community, and reiterates its commitment to strengthening coordination within the United Nations in close cooperation with all other multilateral financial, trade and development institutions in order to support sustainable development, particularly in the context of the post-2015 development agenda;
	4.	Also reaffirms the need to strengthen the central role of the United Nations in enhancing the global partnership for development, with a view to creating a supportive global environment for the attainment of the Millennium Development Goals, including accelerating efforts to deliver and fully implement existing global partnership for development commitments, and emphasizes in this regard the need for enhanced accountability of the United Nations development system to Member States; 
	5.	Recognizes that the scaling-up of successful policies and approaches in the implementation and the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals needs to be complemented by a strengthened global partnership for development; 
	6.	Also recognizes the central role of a strengthened global partnership for development, based on lessons learned in the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, to support a truly universal global development agenda beyond 2015; 
	7.	Further recognizes that the increasing interdependence of national economies in a globalizing world and the emergence of rules-based regimes for international economic relations have meant that the space for national economic policy, that is, the scope for domestic policy, especially in the areas of trade, investment and international development, is now often framed by international disciplines, commitments and global market considerations and that it is for each Government to evaluate the trade-off between the benefits of accepting international rules and commitments and the constraints posed by the loss of policy space; 
	8.	Recognizes that policies which integrate the three dimensions of sustainable development can contribute to reducing inequalities within and among countries, with a view to guaranteeing that the poor and those living in the most vulnerable situations maximize their benefits from a globalized world; 
	9.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its seventieth session the item entitled "Globalization and interdependence", and requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly a report on the sub-item entitled "Role of the United Nations in promoting development in the context of globalization and interdependence".

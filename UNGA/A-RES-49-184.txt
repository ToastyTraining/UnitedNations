	Recalling that it is the responsibility of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to coordinate relevant United Nations education and public information programmes in the field of human rights, 7/

	Taking note of the report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, 8/ in paragraph 94 of which he declared that human rights education is essential for the encouragement of harmonious inter-community relations, for mutual tolerance and understanding and finally for peace,

	Aware of the experience in human rights education of United Nations peace-building operations, including the United Nations Observer Mission in El Salvador and the United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia,

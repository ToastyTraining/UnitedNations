	[on the report of the Fifth Committee (A/51/726/Add.1)]


51/234.Financing of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission

	The General Assembly,

	Having considered the reports of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission,1 the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions2 and the report of the Office of Internal Oversight Services,3

	Recalling Security Council resolutions 687 (1991) of 3 April 1991 and 689 (1991) of 9 April 1991, by which the Council decided to establish the United Nations Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission and to review the question of its termination or continuation every six months,

	Recalling also its resolution 45/260 of 3 May 1991 on the financing of the Observation Mission and its subsequent resolutions and decisions thereon, the latest of which were resolution 50/234 of 7 June 1996 and decision 51/440 of 16 December 1996,

	Reaffirming that the costs of the Observation Mission that are not covered by voluntary contributions are expenses of the Organization to be borne by Member States in accordance with Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter of the United Nations,

	Recalling its previous decisions regarding the fact that, in order to meet the expenditures caused by the Observation Mission, a different procedure is required from the one applied to meet expenditures of the regular budget of the United Nations,


	Taking into account the fact that the economically more developed countries are in a position to make relatively larger contributions and that the economically less developed countries have a relatively limited capacity to contribute towards such an operation,

	Bearing in mind the special responsibilities of the States permanent members of the Security Council, as indicated in General Assembly resolution 1874 (S-IV) of 27 June 1963, in the financing of such operations,

	Expressing its appreciation for the substantial voluntary contributions made to the Observation Mission by the Government of Kuwait and the contributions of other Governments,

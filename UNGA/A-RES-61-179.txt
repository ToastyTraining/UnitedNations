[on the report of the Third Committee (A/61/444)]
61/179.	International cooperation in the prevention, combating and elimination of kidnapping and in providing assistance to victims 


	The General Assembly,
	Concerned at the increase in the offence of kidnapping in various countries of the world and at the harmful effects of that crime on victims and their families, and determined to support measures to assist and protect them and to promote their recovery,
	Reiterating that the kidnapping of persons under any circumstances and for any purpose constitutes a serious crime and a violation of individual freedom that undermines human rights,
	Concerned at the growing tendency of organized criminal groups and also of terrorist groups in certain circumstances to resort to kidnapping, especially for the purpose of extortion, as a method of accumulating capital with a view to consolidating their criminal operations and undertaking other illegal activities, regardless of their purposes, such as trafficking in firearms and drugs and money-laundering,
	Convinced that any linkage of various illegal activities involving kidnapping poses an additional threat to quality of life and hinders economic and social development,
	Convinced also that the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime1 provides a legal framework when necessary for international cooperation with a view to preventing, combating and eradicating kidnapping,
	Recalling its resolution 59/154 of 20 December 2004 entitled "International cooperation in the prevention, combating and elimination of kidnapping and in providing assistance to victims", in which it requested the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, subject to the availability of extrabudgetary resources, to prepare a manual, for use by competent authorities, of proven and promising practices in the fight against kidnapping,
	Acknowledging the financial and technical contributions made by Member States to the preparation of the manual,
	1.	Vigorously condemns and rejects once again the offence of kidnapping, under any circumstances and for any purpose;
	2.	Notes with satisfaction the publication of the operational manual against kidnapping prepared pursuant to its resolution 59/154, and expresses its appreciation to the intergovernmental group of experts entrusted with the preparation of the manual;
	3.	Encourages Member States to continue to foster international cooperation, especially extradition, mutual legal assistance, collaboration between law enforcement authorities and exchange of information, with a view to preventing, combating and eradicating kidnapping;
	4.	Calls upon Member States that have not yet done so, in furtherance of the fight against kidnapping, to strengthen their measures against money-laundering and to engage in international cooperation and mutual legal assistance in, inter alia, the tracing, detection, freezing and confiscation of proceeds of kidnapping;
	5.	Calls upon Member States to take measures intended to provide adequate assistance and protection to victims of kidnapping and their families;
	6.	Invites Member States, once they have considered the operational manual, to consider the possibility of using it in their national efforts to combat kidnapping, and requests the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, within available extrabudgetary resources, not excluding the use of existing resources from the regular budget of the Office,2 to provide to Member States, upon request, technical assistance and advice in implementing the provisions of the manual;
	7.	Requests the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime to report to the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice at its sixteenth session on the implementation of the present resolution, and thereafter, to share its report with the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime.

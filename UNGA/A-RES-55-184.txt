[on the report of the Second Committee (A/55/579/Add.3)]
55/184.	Enhancing international cooperation towards a durable solution to the external debt problem of developing countries
	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 51/164 of 16 December 1996, 52/185 of 18 December 1997, 53/175 of 15 December 1998 and 54/202 of 22 December 1999 on enhancing international cooperation towards a durable solution to the external debt problems of developing countries,
	Taking note of the report of the Secretary-General on recent developments in the debt situation of developing countries,1
	Recalling  the United Nations Millennium Declaration adopted by the heads of State and Government on 8 September 2000,2
	Noting with concern the continuing debt and debt-servicing problems of heavily indebted developing countries as constituting an element that adversely affects their development efforts and economic growth, and stressing the importance of alleviating once and for all, where applicable, their onerous debt and debt-service burden with the aim of attaining a sustainable level of debt and debt service,
	Noting with great concern the continuing high debt burden borne by most African countries and the least developed countries, as exacerbated, inter alia, by the declining trend in commodity prices, and noting that the financial crisis has aggravated the debt-service burdens of many developing countries, including low- and middle-income countries, in particular in the context of meeting their international debt and debt-servicing obligations in a timely fashion despite serious external and domestic financial constraints,
	Reaffirming the need to consider further measures, as appropriate, for dealing with the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries in an effective, equitable and development-oriented manner, in order to help them to exit from the rescheduling process and unsustainable debt burdens, and welcoming the efforts already made in this regard,
	Welcoming and emphasizing the importance of the efforts of debtor countries to pursue, despite the great social cost often involved, economic reforms and structural adjustment programmes that are aimed at achieving stability, raising domestic savings and investment, attaining competitiveness to take advantage of market access opportunities where available, reducing inflation, improving economic efficiency and addressing the social aspects of development, including the eradication of poverty and the development of social safety nets for the vulnerable and poorer strata of their populations, and encouraging them to continue in these efforts,
	Recognizing that close attention should be paid to the impact of economic reforms on the poor and, in this context, that the country-owned poverty reduction strategy papers linked to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative should contribute to poverty reduction,
	Stressing the need for continuing global economic growth, equitable distribution of the opportunities and benefits of globalization and a continuing supportive international economic environment with regard to, inter alia, terms of trade, commodity prices, improved market access, trade practices, access to technology, exchange rates and international interest rates, and noting the continued need for resources for sustained economic growth and sustainable development of the developing countries, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and the results of recent United Nations conferences,
	Noting that mechanisms such as debt rescheduling and debt conversions alone are not sufficient to resolve all of the problems relating to long-term debt sustainability, and, in this connection, stressing the continuing need for sound macroeconomic policies as well as the need for full, swift and effective implementation of initiatives that will further assist developing countries, in particular the poorest and most heavily indebted countries, especially in Africa, in their efforts to improve their debt situation, in view of their continued very high levels of total debt stock and debt-service burdens,
	Welcoming the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, launched by the Group of Seven major industrialized countries at their meeting held at Cologne, Germany, from 18 to 20 June 1999, and the decisions on the enhanced initiative taken by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in October 1999 that are designed to provide deeper, broader and faster relief,
	Welcoming also the actions taken by creditor countries within the framework of the Paris Club and by some creditor countries through the cancellation of bilateral debts, and urging all creditor countries to participate in efforts to remedy the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries,
	Welcoming further the adoption by the Executive Boards of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank of a number of measures to speed up the implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, including greater flexibility on track record with a focus on policy implementation, as well as the emphasis that the decision point may be reached and that debt relief may be provided before the finalization of full poverty reduction strategy papers, as long as interim poverty reduction strategy papers are agreed, and noting with appreciation their approval of proposals to streamline preliminary heavily indebted poor countries documents,
	Recognizing that the full implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative will require substantial financial resources, and, in this regard, stressing the need for fair, equitable and transparent burden-sharing among the international public creditor community and other donor countries, and also stressing the need to fund adequately the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund and the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility/Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund, and, in this regard, welcoming the contributions and pledges made by donors to the trust funds, 
	Noting with concern that some highly indebted middle-income developing countries are facing serious difficulties in meeting their external debt-servicing obligations owing, inter alia, to liquidity constraints, 
	Stressing that the effective management of the debt of developing countries, including middle-income countries, is an important factor, among others, in their sustained economic growth and in the smooth functioning of the world economy, 
	Stressing also the importance of a sound enabling environment for effective debt management, 
	1.	Recognizes that effective, equitable, development-oriented and durable solutions to the external debt and debt-service burdens of developing countries can contribute substantially to the strengthening of the global economy and to the efforts of developing countries to achieve sustained economic growth and sustainable development, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and the results of recent global conferences;
	2.	Reaffirms the need, as expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration,2 for the international community to deal comprehensively and effectively with the debt problems of low- and middle-income developing countries, through various national and international measures designed to make their debt sustainable in the long term; 
	3.	Calls for the full, speedy and effective implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, and, in this regard, stresses the need for the donor community to provide the additional resources necessary to fulfil the future financial requirements of the Initiative, hence welcomes the agreement that financing for heavily indebted poor countries should be reviewed analytically and separately from International Development Association replenishment requirements but back to back with meetings for the thirteenth replenishment of the Association, and calls upon all donors to participate fully in this process; 
	4.	Calls upon the heavily indebted poor countries to take, as soon as possible, the policy measures necessary to become eligible for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and to reach the decision point;
	5.	Reiterates its call upon industrialized countries, as expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration in the context of addressing the special needs of the least developed countries, to agree to cancel all bilateral official debts of the heavily indebted poor countries in return for their making demonstrable commitments to poverty reduction;
	6.	Stresses the importance of continuing to implement the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative flexibly, noting the provision of significant interim debt relief between the decision and completion points and taking due account of the policy performance of the countries concerned in a transparent manner and with the full involvement of the debtor countries, including for the setting of the floating completion point, and in this regard stresses the importance of country-owned poverty reduction strategy papers;
	7.	Also stresses the importance of continued flexibility with regard to the eligibility criteria for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, in particular for countries in post-conflict situations; 
	8.	Notes that it is important for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to continue their efforts to strengthen the transparency and integrity of debt sustainability analysis, and also notes the importance of cooperation with debtor countries in order to obtain relevant information; 
	9.	Welcomes the framework for strengthening the link between debt relief and poverty eradication, and stresses the need for its continued flexible implementation, recognizing that, while the poverty reduction strategy papers should be in place by the decision point, on a transitional basis the decision point could be reached with agreement on an interim poverty reduction strategy paper, but that in all cases demonstrable progress in implementing a poverty reduction strategy would be required by the completion point; 
	10.	Emphasizes that poverty reduction programmes as linked to the implementation of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative must be country-driven and in accordance with the priorities and programmes of countries eligible under the Initiative, and stresses the importance of a participatory process that involves civil society in this regard;
	11.	Welcomes the decision of those countries that have cancelled bilateral official debt, and urges creditor countries that have not done so to consider the full cancellation and equivalent relief of the bilateral official debts of countries eligible under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative and, as appropriate, action to address the needs of post-conflict countries, in particular those with protracted arrears, developing countries affected by serious natural disasters and poor countries with very low social and human development indicators, including the possibility of debt-relief measures, and stresses the importance of building coalitions with civil society organizations and non-governmental organizations in all countries to ensure in the shortest possible time the implementation of pronouncements of debt forgiveness; 
	12.	Notes that the multilateral debt-relief funds can have a positive impact in assisting Governments in safeguarding or increasing expenditures on priority social sectors, and encourages donors and other countries in a position to do so to continue their efforts in this regard in the context of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative;
	13.	Emphasizes the need to secure adequate funding for an overall financing plan for the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, including in particular the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund and the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility/Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Trust Fund in the context of fair, equitable and transparent burden-sharing;
	14.	Stresses the principle that funding of any debt relief should not affect adversely the support for other development activities in favour of developing countries, including the level of funding for United Nations funds and programmes; welcomes, in this regard, the decision of the Joint Ministerial Committee of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund on the Transfer of Real Resources to Developing Countries that financing of debt relief should not compromise the financing made available through concessional windows such as the International Development Association; and expresses its appreciation to those developed countries that have reached, gone beyond or recently made commitments towards reaching the agreed target for official development assistance of 0.7 per cent of their gross national product, and at the same time calls upon other developed countries to meet the target for official development assistance as soon as possible;
	15.	Expresses its appreciation for the action taken by creditor countries of the Paris Club with regard to the debts of developing countries that are affected by natural disasters, and, in this regard, reiterates the need for relief promises to be fulfilled within the shortest possible time frame in order to free the requisite resources for national reconstruction efforts;
	16.	Encourages the international creditor community to consider appropriate measures for countries with a very high level of debt overhang, including, in particular, the poorest African countries, in order to make an appropriate and consistent contribution to the common objective of debt sustainability;
	17.	Recognizes the difficulties of highly indebted middle-income developing countries and other highly indebted middle-income countries in meeting their external debt and debt-servicing obligations, and notes the serious situation in some of them in the context, inter alia, of significant liquidity constraints, which may require debt treatment, including, as appropriate, debt-reduction measures;
	18.	Calls for concerted national and international action to address effectively the debt problems of middle-income developing countries with a view to resolving their potential long-term debt-sustainability problems through various debt-treatment measures, including, as appropriate, existing orderly mechanisms for debt reduction, and encourages all creditors, both public and private, and debtor countries to utilize to the fullest extent possible, where appropriate, the mechanisms for debt reduction;
	19.	Recognizes the need for countries, even when experiencing a debt problem, to continue to work with creditors in order to facilitate continued access to international capital markets, and, in the event that extraordinary circumstances preclude a country from temporarily meeting its debt-servicing commitments, urges creditors and Governments to work together in a transparent and timely fashion towards an orderly and equitable resolution of the repayment problem, including consideration of temporary debt standstill arrangements in exceptional cases;
	20.	Notes the importance of an orderly, gradual and well-sequenced liberalization of capital accounts to strengthen the ability of countries to sustain its consequences so as to mitigate the adverse impact of the volatility of short-term capital flows;
	21.	Stresses that debt relief should contribute to development objectives, including poverty reduction, and in this regard urges countries to direct those resources freed through debt relief, in particular through debt cancellation and reduction, towards these objectives;
	22.	Notes that debt relief alone will not lead to poverty reduction and economic growth, and, in this regard, emphasizes the need for an enabling environment, including sound economic management as well as an efficient, transparent and accountable public service and administration, and stresses the need to mobilize financial resources from all sources, in addition to debt-relief measures and continued concessional financial assistance, in particular to the least developed countries, in order to support their efforts for achieving economic growth and sustainable development;
	23.	Underlines the absolute importance of implementing the resolve expressed in the United Nations Millennium Declaration to create an environment, at the national and global levels alike, that is conducive to development and to the elimination of poverty, inter alia, through good governance within each country as well as good governance at the international level and transparency in the financial, monetary and trading systems;
	24.	Stresses the need to strengthen the institutional capacity of developing countries in debt management, calls upon the international community to support the efforts made towards this end, and, in this regard, stresses the importance of initiatives such as the Debt Management and Financial Analysis System3 and the debt-management capacity-building programme;
	25.	Notes the importance of providing adequate resources for debt-relief measures in the light of the difficulties that many developing countries, especially those in Africa and the least developed countries, are facing with respect to mobilizing both domestic and external resources for their development, and, in accordance with the United Nations Millennium Declaration, calls for special measures to address the challenges of poverty eradication and sustainable development in Africa, including debt cancellation;
	26.	Stresses the importance for developing countries to continue their efforts to promote a favourable environment for attracting foreign investment, thereby promoting economic growth and sustainable development, so as to favour their exit from debt and debt-servicing problems, and also stresses the need for the international community to promote a conducive external environment through, inter alia, improved market access, efforts aimed at the stabilization of exchange rates and the effective stewardship of interest rates, increased resource flows, access to international financial markets, flow of financial resources and improved access to technology for developing countries;
	27.	Calls upon the international community, including the United Nations system, and invites the Bretton Woods institutions, as well as the private sector, to take appropriate measures and actions for the implementation of the commitments, agreements and decisions of the major United Nations conferences and summits on development organized since the beginning of the 1990s, as well as of the results of review processes, in particular those related to the question of the external debt problem of developing countries; 
	28.	Requests the Secretary-General to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-sixth session on the implementation of the present resolution and to include in that report a comprehensive and substantive analysis of the external debt and debt-servicing problems of developing countries, including, inter alia, those resulting from global financial instability.

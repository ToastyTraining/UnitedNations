	Recalling further the relevant provisions of the Declaration on Principles of International Law concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among States in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations,1

	Noting with satisfaction the work accomplished by the regional seminars held by the Special Committee during the First and Second International Decades for the Eradication of Colonialism,

	Increasingly aware of the importance of economic, social and cultural development and self-reliance of the Non-Self-Governing Territories and their peoples for the attainment and consolidation of genuine self-government and independence,

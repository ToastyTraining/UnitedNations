	Recalling resolution 19 adopted by the General Conference of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization at its thirtieth session in November 1999,5 concerning the Global Renewable Energy Education and Training Programme 1996-2005, which constitutes one of the major programmes of universal value of the World Solar Programme 1996-2005,
	Reiterating that mutually supportive efforts at the national and international levels are imperative in the pursuit of sustainable development, which includes the provision of financial resources and the transfer of technology for the application of cost-effective energy and the wider use of environment-friendly, renewable energies,
	Acknowledging that the General Assembly continues to play an important role in promoting the World Solar Programme 1996-2005,
	Acknowledging also that the Commission on Sustainable Development and the Economic and Social Council continue to play a pivotal role as forums for the discussion of new and renewable sources of energy and sustainable development, 
	Noting the role that the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization continues to play in the implementation of the World Solar Programme 1996-2005, in particular its efforts, in association with multilateral partners and national specialized institutions, to enhance bilateral and regional cooperation through the joint organization of regional and subregional business and investment forums, 
	Welcoming the recommendations of the Commission on Sustainable Development at its ninth session,6 in particular the references to renewable energy,

	2.	Notes with appreciation the role that the World Solar Commission continues to play in the mobilization of international support and assistance for the implementation of many of the national high-priority projects on renewable sources of energy included in the World Solar Programme 1996-2005, many of which are being executed with national funding; 
	3.	Notes that although significant financial support has been provided by some developed countries that are Members of the United Nations and some intergovernmental organizations, within and outside the United Nations system, in the implementation of the World Solar Programme 1996-2005, more action still needs to be taken in this regard; 
	4.	Encourages national Governments and relevant stakeholders to make more use of the World Solar Programme 1996-2005 as one of the vehicles to boost the development and utilization of solar energy technologies and all forms of new and renewable energy, including biomass, wind, mini-hydro, tidal, ocean and geothermal forms; 
	5.	Invites the international community to support, as appropriate, by, inter alia, providing financial resources, the efforts of developing countries to move towards sustainable patterns of energy production and consumption;

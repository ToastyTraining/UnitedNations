	Reaffirming the Political Declaration adopted by the General Assembly at its twentieth special session3 and the importance of meeting the objectives targeted for 2008, the joint ministerial statement adopted at the ministerial segment of the forty-sixth session of the Commission on Narcotic Drugs,4 the Action Plan5 for the Implementation of the Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction6 and the Action Plan on International Cooperation on the Eradication of Illicit Drug Crops and on Alternative Development,7

II
International cooperation to counter the world drug problem

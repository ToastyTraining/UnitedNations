	52/38.General and complete disarmament

	A

	Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production
	and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction

	The General Assembly,

	Determined to put an end to the suffering and casualties caused by anti-personnel mines that kill or maim hundreds of people every week, mostly innocent and defenceless civilians and especially children, obstruct economic development and reconstruction, inhibit the repatriation of refugees and internally displaced persons, and have other severe consequences for years after emplacement,

	Believing it necessary to do the utmost to contribute in an efficient and coordinated manner to facing the challenge of removing anti-personnel mines placed throughout the world, and to assure their destruction,

	Wishing to do the utmost in assuring assistance for the care and rehabilitation, including the social and economic reintegration, of mine victims,

	Recalling its resolution 51/45 S of 10 December 1996 urging all States to pursue vigorously an effective, legally binding international agreement to ban the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel landmines with a view to completing the negotiation as soon as possible,

	Stressing the role of public conscience in furthering the principles of humanity as evidenced by the call for a total ban on anti-personnel mines, and recognizing the efforts to that end undertaken by the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement, the International Campaign to Ban Landmines and numerous other non-governmental organizations around the world,


	Recalling the Ottawa Declaration of 5 October 19961 and the Brussels Declaration of 27 June 19972 urging the international community to negotiate an international and legally binding agreement prohibiting the use, stockpiling, production and transfer of anti-personnel mines,

	Emphasizing the desirability of attracting the adherence of all States to the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, and determined to work strenuously towards the promotion of its universalization in all relevant forums including, inter alia, the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament, regional organizations and groupings, and review conferences of the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects,3

	Basing itself on the principle of international humanitarian law that the right of the parties to an armed conflict to choose methods or means of warfare is not unlimited, on the principle that prohibits the employment in armed conflicts of weapons, projectiles and materials and methods of warfare of a nature to cause superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering and on the principle that a distinction must be made between civilians and combatants,

	Welcoming the conclusion of negotiations on 18 September 1997 at Oslo on the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction,

	1.	Invites all States to sign the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, which was open for signature at Ottawa on 3 and 4 December 1997 and at Headquarters in New York on 5 December 1997, and which shall remain open for signature thereafter at Headquarters until its entry into force;

	2.	Urges all States to ratify the Convention without delay subsequent to their signatures; 

	3.	Calls upon all States to contribute towards the full realization and effective implementation of the Convention to advance the care and rehabilitation, and the social and economic reintegration of mine victims, and mine-awareness programmes, and the removal of anti-personnel mines placed throughout the world and the assurance of their destruction;

	B

	Continuing to hold the view that an enhanced level of transparency in all types of armaments contributes greatly to confidence-building and security among States,

	Taking duly into account the relationship between transparency and the security needs of all States at the regional and international levels,

	Recognizing that, notwithstanding the fact that the United Nations Register of Conventional Arms4 in its current form deals with seven categories of conventional weapons, the principle of transparency should also apply to weapons of mass destruction and to transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons,

	Convinced that an enhanced level of transparency in weapons of mass destruction and transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons could serve as a catalyst towards general and complete disarmament,

	Stressing the need to achieve universality of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons,5 the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons and on Their Destruction6 and the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on Their Destruction,7 as well as other instruments related to transfers of equipment and technologies directly related to the development and manufacture of such weapons, with a view to realizing the goal of the total elimination of all weapons of mass destruction,

	1.	Recognizes that, in view of recent political developments, the time is now opportune for all nuclear-weapon States to undertake effective disarmament measures with a view to the total elimination of these weapons within a time-bound framework;

	2.	Recognizes also that there is a genuine need to de-emphasize the role of nuclear weapons, and to review and revise nuclear doctrines accordingly;

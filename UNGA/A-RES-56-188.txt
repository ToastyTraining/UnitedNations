	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 52/195 of 18 December 1997, 54/210 of 22 December 1999 and all its other resolutions on the integration of women in development, and the relevant resolutions and agreed conclusions, including those on women in the economy,1 adopted by the Commission on the Status of Women,
	Reaffirming the Beijing Declaration2 and Platform for Action3 and the outcome documents of the twenty-third special session of the General Assembly, entitled "Women 2000: gender equality, development and peace for the twenty-first century",4 as well as the outcomes of other recent major United Nations conferences and summits and other relevant special sessions of the General Assembly and their follow-up processes,
	Reaffirming also the United Nations Millennium Declaration,5 which affirms that the equal rights and opportunities of women and men must be assured, and calls for, inter alia, the promotion of gender equality and the empowerment of women as effective ways to combat poverty, hunger and disease and to stimulate development that is truly sustainable,
	Reaffirming further that gender equality is of fundamental importance for achieving sustained economic growth and sustainable development, in accordance with the relevant General Assembly resolutions and recent United Nations conferences, and that investing in the development of women and girls has a multiplier effect, in particular on productivity, efficiency and sustained economic growth,
	Recognizing the significant contribution that women make to the economy and the major force that they represent for change and development in all sectors of the economy, especially in key areas such as agriculture, industry and services,
	Reaffirming that women are key contributors to the economy and to combating poverty through both remunerated and unremunerated work at home, in the community and in the workplace, and that the empowerment of women is a critical factor in the eradication of poverty,
	Recognizing that population and development issues, education and training, health, nutrition, the environment, water supply, sanitation, housing, communications, science and technology and employment opportunities are important elements for effective poverty eradication and the advancement and empowerment of women,
	Recognizing also, in this context, the importance of respect for all human rights, including the right to development, and of a national and international environment that promotes, inter alia, justice, gender equality, equity, popular participation and political freedom for the advancement and empowerment of women,
	Recognizing further that education and training, in particular in business, trade, administration, information and communication technologies and other new technologies, are essential for gender equality, the empowerment of women and poverty eradication,
	Recognizing that the difficult socio-economic conditions that exist in many developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, have resulted in the acceleration of the feminization of poverty and that the empowerment of women is a critical factor in the eradication of poverty,
	Recognizing also that poverty eradication and the achievement and preservation of peace are mutually reinforcing, and recognizing further that peace is inextricably linked to equality between women and men and to development,
	Aware that, although globalization and liberalization processes have created employment opportunities for women in many countries, they have made women, especially in developing countries and in particular in the least developed countries, more vulnerable to problems caused by increased economic volatility,
	Recognizing that some effects of market liberalization may deepen the socio-economic marginalization of women in the agricultural sector, including through the loss of employment among small-scale farmers who are more likely to be women than men, and emphasizing that women who are small-scale farmers need special support and empowerment so as to be able to meet the challenges and take advantage of the opportunities of agricultural market liberalization,
	Recognizing also that enhanced trade opportunities for developing countries, including through trade liberalization, will improve the economic condition of those societies, including women, which is of particular importance in rural communities,
	Aware that, while women represent an important and growing proportion of business owners, their contribution to economic and social development is constrained by, inter alia, the lack of equal access of women and men to, and control over, credit, technology, support services, land and information,
	Concerned that the continuing discrimination against women, the denial or lack of equal rights and access to education, training and credit facilities and the lack of control over land, capital, technology and other areas of production impede their full and equal contribution to, and equal opportunity to benefit from, development,	
	Emphasizing the promotion of programmes aimed at financial intermediation with a view to ensuring the access of rural women to credit and to agricultural inputs and implements and, in particular, to easing collateral requirements for access to finance by women,

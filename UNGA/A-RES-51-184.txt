	Welcoming the achievements of the second session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, held at Geneva from 8 to 19 July 1996, and noting that the Conference of the Parties at its second session adopted by consensus a series of substantive decisions,2 

	Recalling that at its second session the Conference of the Parties took note, without formal adoption, of the Geneva Ministerial Declaration3 which received majority support among ministers and other heads of delegations attending the Conference, which, inter alia, called for acceleration of negotiations on the text of a legally binding protocol or another legal instrument to be completed in due time for adoption at the third session of the Conference of the Parties,

	Concerned that changes in climate may result in significant and often adverse impacts on many ecological systems and socio-economic sectors, including food supply and water resources, and on human health, and noting that in some cases the impacts are potentially irreversible, and that developing countries and small island developing States are typically more vulnerable to climate change,

	Looking forward to the continued efforts of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies in addressing climate change and, in particular, to the successful conclusion of the Berlin Mandate4 process at the third session of the Conference of the Parties,

	Reiterating that a comprehensive approach should be adopted by the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies in the implementation of the Convention, including the full consideration of the particular situation of the developing countries as recognized by the Convention,

	Taking note with appreciation of the generous offer of the Government of Japan to host the third session of the Conference of the Parties at Kyoto from 1 to 12 December 1997,5 

	Noting that the relocation of the Convention secretariat to Bonn, Germany, is well under way, and expressing its appreciation to the Government of Germany and the city of Bonn for the facilities and support they are providing to the secretariat,

	Recalling its request to the Secretary-General, as put forth in paragraph 9 of resolution 50/115, to make the necessary arrangements to include in the calendar of conferences and meetings for the biennium 1998-1999 those sessions of the Conference of the Parties and its subsidiary bodies that the Conference may need to convene in that period, and noting that those arrangements should be made without prejudice to the outcome of the review referred to in paragraph 3 below,

	4.	Notes with appreciation contributions made to the extrabudgetary funds established under paragraphs 10 and 20 of resolution 45/212 and maintained in accordance with resolution 47/195, and calls upon Member States that are parties to the Convention to also contribute generously to the trust fund for participation in the Convention process, envisaged in paragraph 15 of its financial procedures, and to the trust funds envisaged for supplementary activities under the Convention;9 

	5.	Calls upon Member States that are parties to the Convention to pay in full and in a timely manner for each of the years 1996 and 1997, in accordance with the indicative scale adopted by consensus by the Conference of the Parties,10 the contributions required for the trust fund for the core budget of the Convention, envisaged in paragraph 13 of its financial procedures, so as to ensure continuity in the cash flow required to finance the ongoing work of the Conference of the Parties, the subsidiary bodies and the Convention secretariat;

	6.	Invites the Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to report to the General Assembly at its fifty-second session and, pending the outcome of the special session of the General Assembly in 1997, to report on the results of future meetings of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention;

	7.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-second session the item entitled "Protection of global climate for present and future generations of mankind" and to consider at that session the reviews requested in paragraph 10 of resolution 50/115.

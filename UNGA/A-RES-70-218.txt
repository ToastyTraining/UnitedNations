	Reaffirming that each country faces specific challenges in its pursuit of sustainable development, that the most vulnerable countries and, in particular, African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States deserve special attention, as do countries in situations of conflict and post-conflict countries, and that there are also serious challenges within many middle-income countries,
	Expressing concern about the adverse impact of the consequences of the world financial and economic crisis, including on development, and evidence of an uneven, fragile and slow recovery, cognizant that the global economy, notwithstanding significant efforts that helped to contain tail risks, improve financial market conditions and stability and sustain recovery, still remains in a challenging phase, with downside risks, including high volatility in global markets, excessive volatility of commodity prices, high unemployment, particularly among young people, unsustainable debt in some countries and widespread fiscal strains, which pose challenges for global economic recovery and reflect the need for additional progress towards sustaining and rebalancing global demand, and stressing the need for continuing efforts to address systemic fragilities and imbalances and to reform and strengthen the international financial system while implementing the reforms agreed upon to date,
	Reaffirming that climate change is one of the greatest challenges of our time, that its adverse impacts undermine the ability of all countries to achieve sustainable development, that increases in global temperature, sea level rise, ocean acidification and other climate change impacts are seriously affecting coastal areas and low-lying coastal countries, including many least developed countries and small island developing States, and that the survival of many societies and of the biological support systems of the planet are at risk, further threatening food security and efforts to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development, and thus requiring urgent action to maintain, preserve and sustain the development gains achieved in the past decades,
	Concerned that, past the midway point of the Second United Nations Decade for the Eradication of Poverty (2008-2017), while there has been progress in reducing poverty, especially in some middle-income countries, such progress has been uneven, with the number of people living in poverty in its different forms and dimensions continuing to increase and inequalities to rise in some countries, with women and children constituting the majority of the most affected groups, especially in the least developed countries and particularly in sub-Saharan Africa,

	Reaffirming that eradicating poverty is the greatest global challenge facing the world today and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, particularly in Africa, in the least developed countries, small island developing States and in some middle-income countries, and underlining the importance of accelerating sustainable, inclusive and equitable economic growth and sustainable development, including full, productive employment generation and decent work for all, with a view to reducing inequalities within and among countries,
	Acknowledging that the eradication of poverty requires a balanced approach to the three dimensions of sustainable development - economic, social and environmental - in order to ensure that gains are irreversible,
	Reaffirming that women are key contributors to the economy and to combating poverty and inequalities, through both paid and unpaid work, at home, in the community and in the workplace, and that evidence shows that gender equality, the empowerment of women and their full and equal participation and leadership in the economy are vital in order to achieve sustainable development and significantly enhance economic growth and productivity, and reaffirming also that gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls will make a crucial contribution to progress in realizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and are critical factors in the eradication of poverty,
	Recognizing the importance of supporting countries in their efforts to eradicate poverty and promote the empowerment of the poor and people in vulnerable situations, including women, children and youth, indigenous peoples, older persons, persons with disabilities, migrants, refugees and internally displaced persons,
	Recognizing also that the difficult socioeconomic conditions that exist in many developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, have contributed to the feminization of poverty,
	Recognizing further the centrality of mobilizing financial and non-financial resources for development at the national and international levels and the effective use of those resources, as well as the importance of policy coherence and an enabling environment for sustainable development, at all levels and by all actors, and of reinvigorating the global partnership for sustainable development in support of the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, as established by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals,
	Expressing concern that aggregate/net official development assistance (ODA) fell from 0.30 per cent in 2013 to 0.29 per cent in 2014, while noting that aggregate/net ODA has increased since 2000 and has long been a key source of financing for development, and reiterating the call on those Member States that have made commitments to fulfil those commitments and step up efforts to increase their assistance and make additional concrete efforts towards meeting their ODA targets,
	Underscoring that, for all countries, public policies and the mobilization and effective use of domestic resources, underscored by the principle of national ownership, are central to the common pursuit of sustainable development, including achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, and recognizing that domestic resources are first and foremost generated by economic growth, supported by an enabling environment at all levels,
	Acknowledging that South-South cooperation is not a substitute for but rather a complement to North-South cooperation, and recognizing the contributions of South-South and triangular cooperation to the efforts of developing countries to eradicate poverty and pursue sustainable development,
	Acknowledging also that good governance at the national and international levels and sustainable, inclusive, sustained and equitable economic growth, supported by full employment and decent work for all, rising productivity and a favourable environment, including public and private investment and entrepreneurship, are necessary to eradicate poverty, achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Sustainable Development Goals, as established by the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the unfinished business of the Millennium Development Goals, and to realize a rise in living standards, and that corporate social responsibility initiatives play an important role in maximizing the impact of public and private investment,
	Underlining the priority and urgency given by Heads of State and Government to the eradication of poverty, as expressed in the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields,
	Emphasizing the essential role of inclusive and sustainable industrial development as part of a comprehensive strategy of structural economic transformation in eradicating poverty and supporting sustained economic growth and thus in contributing to achieving sustainable development in developing countries, including the most vulnerable countries, in particular African countries, the least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States, while recognizing the specific challenges facing middle-income countries, and emphasizing also that countries in situations of conflict and post-conflict countries also deserve special attention,
	Taking note of the work done under the inter-agency, system-wide plan of action for poverty eradication coordinating the efforts of the United Nations system in its advisory and programmatic support to Member States, involving more than 21 agencies, funds, programmes and regional commissions, and encouraging the alignment of that work with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development,
	Stressing the importance of policies to address longer-term structural issues, including structural constraints faced by women as economic agents, and to diversify commodity economies and integrate commodity policies into wider development and poverty eradication strategies at all levels,
	Stressing also the importance of inclusiveness within the United Nations development system and that no country is left behind in the implementation of the present resolution,

	3.	Also reaffirms that eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, as well as an overarching objective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, of which the Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the Third International Conference on Financing for Development14 is an integral part;
	4.	Further reaffirms that each country must take primary responsibility for its own economic and social development and that the role of national policies and development strategies for the achievement of sustainable development and poverty eradication cannot be overemphasized, and recognizes that increased effective national efforts should be complemented by concrete, effective and supportive international programmes, measures and policies aimed at expanding the development opportunities of developing countries, while taking into account national conditions and ensuring respect for national ownership strategies and sovereignty;
	5.	Emphasizes the need to accord the highest priority within the United Nations development agenda to the eradication of poverty in all its forms and dimensions in order to ensure that gains are irreversible, while stressing the importance of addressing the causes and challenges of poverty through integrated, coordinated and coherent strategies at the national, intergovernmental and inter-agency levels, in accordance with the outcomes of the major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields;

	10.	Acknowledges the complexity of the challenge of poverty eradication, and in this regard emphasizes that, in accelerating poverty eradication, the organizations of the United Nations development system must be driven by national priorities, with the development of national capacities in developing countries continuing to be a core area of focus, and operate in an integrated, coordinated and coherent manner, through development programmes and projects that address poverty eradication as their underlying objective, within their respective mandates, in order to ensure that gains are irreversible, making full use of the interlinked and mutually reinforcing pillars of the United Nations development system, and encourages the use of diverse strategies;

	12.	Emphasizes that international public finance plays an important role in complementing the efforts of countries to mobilize public resources domestically, especially in the poorest and most vulnerable countries with limited domestic resources, and that an important use of international public finance, including ODA, is to catalyse additional resource mobilization from other public and private sources, and that ODA providers reaffirm their respective commitments, including the commitment by many developed countries to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for official development assistance (ODA/GNI) to developing countries and 0.15 per cent to 0.2 per cent of ODA/GNI to the least developed countries;
	13.	Welcomes the increase in the volume of ODA since the adoption of the Monterrey Consensus,9 expresses its concern that many countries still fall short of their ODA commitments, reiterates that the fulfilment of all ODA commitments remains crucial, welcomes those few countries that have met or surpassed their commitment to 0.7 per cent of ODA/GNI and the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to the least developed countries, urges all other countries to step up efforts to increase their ODA and to make additional concrete efforts towards the ODA targets, welcomes the decision by the European Union reaffirming its collective commitment to achieve the target of 0.7 per cent of ODA/GNI within the time frame of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and undertaking to meet collectively the target of 0.15 to 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to the least developed countries in the short term and to reach 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to the least developed countries within the time frame of the 2030 Agenda, and encourages ODA providers to consider setting a target to provide at least 0.20 per cent of ODA/GNI to the least developed countries;
	14.	Recognizes the importance of focusing the majority of concessional resources on those countries with the greatest needs and least ability to mobilize other resources, notes with great concern in this regard the decline in the share of ODA to the least developed countries, commits to reversing this decline, and welcomes those who are allocating at least 50 per cent of their ODA to the least developed countries;
	15.

	16.	Notes that an important use of international public finance, including ODA, is to catalyse additional resource mobilization from other sources, public and private, also noting that it can support improved tax collection and help to strengthen domestic enabling environments and build essential public services and can also be used to unlock additional finance through blended or pooled financing and risk mitigation, notably for infrastructure and other investments that support private sector development;

	18.	Welcomes the increasing efforts to improve the quality of ODA and to increase its development impact, recognizes the Development Cooperation Forum of the Economic and Social Council, notes other initiatives, such as the high-level forums on aid effectiveness, which produced, inter alia, the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the Accra Agenda for Action15 and the Busan Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation, which make important contributions to the efforts of the countries that have made commitments to them, including through the adoption of the fundamental principles of national ownership, alignment, harmonization and managing for results, and bears in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all formula that will guarantee effective assistance and that the specific situation of each country needs to be fully considered;
	19.	Recognizes the urgent need to address poverty, hunger, malnutrition and food security, which will lead to rich payoffs across the Sustainable Development Goals, and encourages the international community to enhance international cooperation and devote resources to developing rural and urban areas and sustainable agriculture and fisheries and to supporting smallholder farmers, especially women farmers, herders and fishers in developing countries, particularly in the least developed countries;
	20.

	24.	Recognizes that poverty is multidimensional, invites national Governments, supported by the international community, to consider developing complementary measurements that better reflect this multidimensionality, and emphasizes the importance of developing a common understanding among national Governments and other stakeholders of the multidimensional nature of poverty;
	25.

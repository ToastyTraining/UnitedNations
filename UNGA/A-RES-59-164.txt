Strongly encourages Member States to support the efforts of the United Nations and the specialized agencies, funds and programmes to achieve the goal of 50/50 gender distribution, especially at senior and policy-making levels, by identifying and regularly submitting more women candidates for appointment to positions in the United Nations system, by identifying and proposing national recruitment sources in cooperation with national women's machineries and professional organization networks and by encouraging more women to apply for positions within the Secretariat, the specialized agencies, funds and programmes and the regional commissions, including in areas in which women are underrepresented, such as peacekeeping, peacebuilding and other non-traditional areas;
	14.	Requests the Secretary-General to provide an oral report to the Commission on the Status of Women at its forty-ninth and fiftieth sessions and to report to the General Assembly at its sixty-first session on the implementation of the present resolution, including by providing up-to-date statistics on all levels of the United Nations system.

	Recalling its resolutions 69/313 of 27 July 2015 and 70/1 of 25 September 2015, in which it established and launched a Technology Facilitation Mechanism to support the Sustainable Development Goals, composed of a United Nations inter-agency task team on science, technology and innovation for the Sustainable Development Goals, a multi-stakeholder forum on science, technology and innovation for the Sustainable Development Goals and an online platform,
	Recalling also its resolution 70/213 of 22 December 2015, entitled "Science, technology and innovation for development", and other relevant resolutions, and noting the work on emerging technologies by relevant United Nations entities,

	Recognizing also the vital role that science, technology and innovation, including environmentally sound technologies, can play in development and in facilitating efforts to address global challenges, such as efforts to eradicate poverty, achieve food security and nutrition, improve agriculture, enhance access to energy and increase energy efficiency, fight diseases, improve education, protect the environment, accelerate the pace of economic diversification and transformation, improve productivity and competitiveness and ultimately support sustainable development,
	Noting with concern that, recent progress notwithstanding, important and growing divides with regard to science and technology remain between? and within developed and developing countries, all of which need to be addressed, inter alia, by encouraging access to science and technology for developing countries, addressing challenges to close the digital divides, ensuring an inclusive and gender-sensitive approach and promoting the empowerment of women and girls,
	Recognizing that the creation, development and diffusion of innovations and new technologies and associated know-how are powerful drivers of economic growth and sustainable development, acknowledging both the transformative and disruptive potential of new technologies, particularly advances in automation, on labour markets and on the jobs of the future, and in this regard seeking to prepare societies and economies for these effects, 
	Recognizing also the central role that the Commission on Science and Technology for Development plays, as the United Nations focal point for science, technology and innovation for development, in analysing how science, technology and innovation, including information and communications technologies, serve as enablers of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development3 and in acting as a forum for strategic planning, sharing lessons learned and best practices, providing foresight about critical trends in science, technology and innovation in key sectors of the economy, the environment and society, and drawing attention to emerging and disruptive technologies,

	3.	Also requests the Technology Facilitation Mechanism to present its findings, with an evidence-based approach, in this regard at its third multi-stakeholder forum on science, technology and innovation, in June 2018;
	4.	Decides to include in the programme of the third multi-stakeholder forum a session on the impact of rapid technological change, including in cases in which changes may occur at an exponential pace, on the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, to include Governments, the private sector, international organizations, civil society, the technical and academic communities and other relevant stakeholders, with support for the participation of developing countries, in particular the least developed countries, and to be funded from extrabudgetary resources,? to discuss the findings of the Technology Facilitation Mechanism on rapid technological change, and encourages the forum and the Commission to take into account the findings therein for their consideration;

	4.	Also emphasizes the need for revitalized economic and social development everywhere within a framework that places people at the centre of development and aims to meet human needs rapidly and more effectively by, inter alia, enhancing positive interaction between economic and social policies, and stresses the need for strong, sustained political will at the national, regional and international levels to invest in people and their well-being in order to achieve the objectives of social development;

Calls upon the international community, including international financial institutions, to implement fully and effectively all initiatives that will contribute to a durable solution to the debt problems of developing countries, in particular African countries and the least developed countries, and thus to support their efforts to achieve social development and, in this context, reaffirms the need to make further progress towards the implementation of the recommendations of the Summit by the Bretton Woods institutions, including the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt Initiative;

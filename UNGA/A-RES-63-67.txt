	Taking note of international efforts to prevent and combat illicit arms brokering, in particular in small arms and light weapons, as demonstrated by the adoption in 2001 of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,1 and the entry into force in 2005 of the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime,2
	Noting the report of the Group of Governmental Experts established pursuant to resolution 60/81 of 8 December 2005 to consider further steps to enhance international cooperation in preventing, combating and eradicating illicit brokering in small arms and light weapons3 as an international initiative within the framework of the United Nations, 
	Recalling the report of the Third Biennial Meeting of States to Consider the Implementation of the Programme of Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects,4 which acknowledges the importance of implementing the recommendations contained in the report of the Group of Governmental Experts on illicit brokering,3 and of developing national legislation and administrative procedures in this area,
	Underlining the inherent right of Member States to determine the specific scope and content of domestic regulations in accordance with their legislative frameworks and export control systems, consistent with international laws, 
	Welcoming the efforts made by Member States to implement laws and/or administrative measures to regulate arms brokering within their legal systems,

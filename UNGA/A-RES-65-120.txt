[without reference to a Main Committee (A/65/L.38 and Add.1)]
65/120.	The role of the United Nations in promoting a new global 
human order


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolutions 55/48 of 29 November 2000, 57/12 of 14 November 2002 and 62/213 of 21 December 2007,
	Acknowledging that peace and security, development and human rights are the pillars of the United Nations system and the foundations for collective security and well-being and that development, peace and security and human rights are interlinked and mutually reinforcing, 
	Reaffirming that development is a central goal by itself and that sustainable development in its economic, social and environmental aspects constitutes a key element of the overarching framework of United Nations activities, 
	Recognizing that the well-being of people and the full development of their potential is pivotal to sustainable development, and convinced of the urgency of international cooperation towards that end, 
	Deeply concerned about persistent and considerable disparities between rich and poor, both within and among countries, and about the adverse implications of these disparities for the promotion of human development throughout the world, 
	Stressing the multidimensional nature of inequality and unequal access to social and economic opportunities and their complex interrelationship with efforts to eradicate poverty, promote sustained, inclusive and equitable growth and sustainable development, and the full enjoyment of human rights, especially for those people living in situations of vulnerability, 
	Concerned by the prevalence of gender inequality in various forms worldwide, which is often expressed in poorer outcomes for women relative to men on many social development indicators, 
	Considering that inequalities continue to pose major barriers to attaining the Millennium Development Goals and that efforts to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, often take inadequate account of the relationship and impact of inequality on economic and social development,
	Recognizing the action already under way by all Member States, the United Nations system and other international, regional and national forums and organizations and the progress made to implement the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals, 
	1.	Takes note of the report of the Secretary-General on the implementation of the new global human order;1
	2.	Recalls the High-level Plenary Meeting of the General Assembly on the Millennium Development Goals and its outcome, which includes a broad-based consensus for action that needs to be further strengthened, within a comprehensive and holistic framework towards the achievement of the development goals involving all actors, namely Governments, the United Nations system and other international organizations and relevant actors of civil society, including the private sector, non-governmental organizations and other relevant stakeholders at all levels;2 
	3.	Underscores the continued relevance of the outcomes of all major United Nations conferences and summits in the economic, social and related fields and the commitments set out therein, including the Millennium Development Goals, which have raised awareness and continue to generate real and important development gains, have played a vital role in shaping a broad development vision and constitute the overarching framework for the development activities of the United Nations, and strongly reiterates its determination to ensure the timely and full implementation of those outcomes and commitments; 
	4.	Recognizes that the increased pace of globalization and growing interdependence have heightened the importance of international cooperation and multilateralism in meeting global challenges and solving common problems, including those that have arisen from the uneven impact of globalization on development and human well-being; 
	5.	Emphasizes the need to promote human well-being and the full realization of human potential; 
	6.	Reaffirms that national ownership and leadership are indispensable in the development process and that there is no one-size-fits-all approach, and reiterates that each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development and that the role of national policies, domestic resources and development strategies cannot be overemphasized; domestic economies are now interwoven with the global economic system and, therefore, the effective use of trade and investment opportunities can help countries to fight poverty, and development efforts at the national level need to be supported by an enabling national and international environment that complements national actions and strategies; 
	7.	Also reaffirms the commitment to sound policies, good governance at all levels and the rule of law, to mobilizing domestic resources, fostering international financial flows, assuring long-term investment in human capital and infrastructure, promoting international trade as an engine for economic growth and development and increasing international financial and technical cooperation for development, sustainable debt financing and external debt relief, and to enhancing the coherence and consistency of the international monetary, financial and trading systems;
	8.	Recognizes that inequality within and among countries is a concern for all countries regardless of their level of development and that it represents a growing challenge with multiple implications for the realization of economic and social potential and the achievement of the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals;
	9.	Also recognizes that attention must be focused on the particular needs of developing countries and on the large and increasing economic and social inequalities that exist, and further recognizes that disparities between developed and developing countries and inequalities between the rich and the poor and between rural and urban populations, inter alia, remain persistent and significant and need to be addressed; 
	10.	Calls upon Member States to continue their ambitious efforts to address inequality;
	11.	Stresses that, while efforts to promote sustained, inclusive and equitable economic growth are necessary for accelerating progress towards achieving the Millennium Development Goals, as well as for promoting sustainable development, they are not sufficient and that growth should enable everyone, in particular the poor, to participate in and benefit from economic opportunities, should lead to job creation and income opportunities and be complemented by effective social policies;
	12.	Considers that promoting universal access to social services and providing social protection floors can make an important contribution to consolidating and achieving further development gains, and that social protection systems that address and reduce inequality and social exclusion are essential for protecting the gains made towards the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals; 
	13.	Encourages greater consideration of the impact of social and economic inequalities in development, including in the design and implementation of development strategies, and in this regard also encourages further analytical and empirical research, in particular by the relevant institutions of the United Nations system, as well as the regional commissions and other national and international organizations; 
	14.	Recognizes the efforts of many countries in addressing inequality, and acknowledges the need for strengthened international efforts to complement national efforts in this area; 
	15.	Also recognizes that regional, subregional and interregional cooperation can facilitate the exchange of knowledge and experience and promote the most effective use of resources aimed at achieving human development and reducing inequalities;
	16.	Requests the Secretary-General to submit to the General Assembly at its sixty-seventh session a report on the implementation of the present resolution and to include in the report recommendations on ways and means to address inequality at all levels, in particular within the United Nations framework, as a contribution to ongoing efforts to achieve the internationally agreed development goals, including the Millennium Development Goals; 
	17.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its sixty-seventh session the item entitled "The role of the United Nations in promoting a new global human order".

	RESOLUTION ADOPTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY

	[on the report of the First Committee (A/50/582)]


50/62.The role of science and technology in the context of international security and disarmament


	The General Assembly,

	Recognizing that scientific and technological developments can have both civilian and military applications and that progress in science and technology for civilian applications needs to be maintained and encouraged,

	Stressing the interests of the international community in the subject and the need to follow closely the scientific and technological developments that may have a negative impact on the security environment and on the process of arms limitation and disarmament, and to channel scientific and technological developments for beneficial purposes,

	Cognizant that the international transfer of high-technology products, services and know-how for peaceful purposes is important for the economic and social development of States,

	Recalling that the Final Declaration of the Eleventh Conference of Heads of State or Government of Non-Aligned Countries, held at Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, from 18 to 20 October 1995, noted that restrictions being placed on access to technology through the imposition of non-transparent ad hoc export control regimes with exclusive membership tended to impede the economic and social development of developing countries,

	Emphasizing that the internationally negotiated guidelines for the transfer of high technology with military applications should take into account the legitimate defence requirements of all States, while ensuring that access to high-technology products and services and know-how for peaceful purposes is not denied,


	1.	Affirms that scientific and technological achievements should be used for the benefit of all mankind to promote the sustainable economic and social development of all States and to safeguard international security, and that international cooperation in the use of science and technology through the transfer and exchange of technological know-how for peaceful purposes should be promoted;

	2.	Invites Member States to undertake additional efforts to apply science and technology for disarmament-related purposes and to make disarmament-related technologies available to interested States;

	3.	Urges Member States to undertake multilateral negotiations with the participation of all interested States in order to establish universally acceptable, non-discriminatory guidelines for international transfers of high technology with military applications;

	4.	Requests the Secretary-General to develop a database of concerned research institutions and experts with a view to promoting transparency and international cooperation in the applications of the scientific and technological developments for pursuing disarmament objectives such as disposal of weapons, conversion and verification, among others;

	5.	Encourages the United Nations to contribute, within existing mandates, to promoting the application of science and technology for peaceful purposes;

	6.	Invites all Member States to communicate to the Secretary-General their views and assessment;

	7.	Decides to include in the provisional agenda of its fifty-first session an item entitled "The role of science and technology in the context of international security and disarmament".

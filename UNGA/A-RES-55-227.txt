	The General Assembly,
	Having considered the report of the Secretary-General on the financing of the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo1 and the related report of the Advisory Committee on Administrative and Budgetary Questions,2

	16.	Decides also, as an ad hoc arrangement, and taking into account the amount of 220 million dollars gross (207,407,400 dollars net) already apportioned in accordance with its resolution 54/245 B for the period from 1 July to 31 December 2000, to apportion the additional amount of 230 million dollars gross (214,646,100 dollars net) for the period from 1 January to 30 June 2001 among Member States in accordance with the composition of groups set out in paragraphs 3 and 4 of General Assembly resolution 43/232 of 1 March 1989, as adjusted by the Assembly in its resolutions 44/192 B of 21 December 1989, 45/269 of 27 August 1991, 46/198 A of 20 December 1991, 47/218 A of 23 December 1992, 49/249 A of 20 July 1995, 49/249 B of 14 September 1995, 50/224 of 11 April 1996, 51/218 A to C of 18 December 1996, 52/230 of 31 March 1998 and 55/236 of 23 December 2000 and its decisions 48/472 A of 23 December 1993, 50/451 B of 23 December 1995 and 54/456 to 54/458 of 23 December 1999, and taking into account the scale of assessments for the year 2001, as set out in its resolution 55/5 B of 23 December 2000;

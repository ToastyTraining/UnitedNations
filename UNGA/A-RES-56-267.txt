Resolution adopted by the General Assembly
[on the report of the Third Committee (A/56/581)]
56/267.	Measures to combat contemporary forms of racism and racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance


	The General Assembly,
	Recalling its resolution 55/83 of 4 December 2000, and taking note of Commission on Human Rights resolution 2001/5 of 18 April 2001,1
	Recognizing that the Durban Declaration and Programme of Action adopted by the World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance2 addressed a wide range of practical issues, including measures to combat contemporary manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,
	Stressing that the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on 25 June 1993,3 attaches importance to the elimination of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance,
	Reaffirming the spirit of renewed political will and commitment to combat the scourge of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, from which no country is free,
	Convinced that racism, as one of the exclusionist phenomena plaguing many societies, requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication,
	Deeply concerned that, despite continued efforts, racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance and acts of violence persist and even grow in magnitude, incessantly adopting new forms, including tendencies to establish policies based on racial, religious, ethnic, cultural and national superiority or exclusivity,
	Particularly alarmed at the increase in racist violence in many parts of the world, inter alia, as a result of the resurgent activities of associations established on the basis of racist and xenophobic platforms and charters, and the persistent use of those platforms and charters to promote or incite racist ideologies,
	Emphasizing that remembering the crimes and wrongs of the past, wherever and whenever they occurred, unequivocally condemning its racist tragedies and telling the truth about history are essential elements for international reconciliation and the creation of societies based on justice, equality and solidarity,
	Deeply concerned that those advocating racism and racial discrimination misuse new communication technologies, including the Internet, to disseminate their repugnant views,
	Noting that the use of such technologies can also contribute to combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,
	Conscious of the fundamental difference between, on the one hand, racism and racial discrimination as governmental policy or resulting from official doctrines of racial superiority or exclusivity and, on the other hand, other manifestations of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance that are increasingly visible in segments of many societies and are perpetrated by individuals or groups, some of which manifestations are directed against migrant workers and members of their families,
	Reaffirming the responsibility of Governments for safeguarding and protecting the rights of individuals within their jurisdiction against crimes perpetrated by racist or xenophobic individuals or groups,
	Recognizing both the challenges and the opportunities in combating racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance in an increasingly globalized world,
	Noting with concern that racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance may be aggravated by, inter alia, inequitable distribution of wealth, marginalization and social exclusion,
	Deeply concerned that racism and racial discrimination against migrant workers still persist despite the efforts undertaken by the international community to protect the human rights of migrant workers and members of their families,
	Noting that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in its general recommendation XV (42) of 17 March 19934 concerning article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination,5 holds that the prohibition of the dissemination of ideas based on racial superiority or racial hatred is compatible with the right to freedom of opinion and expression as outlined in article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights6 and in article 5 of the Convention,
	Affirming that universal adherence to and full implementation of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination are of paramount importance for promoting equality and non-discrimination in the world,
	Noting that the reports that the States parties submit under the Convention contain, inter alia, information about the causes of, as well as measures to combat, contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance,
	Noting with concern the existence of multiple discrimination, in particular against women,
	Underlining the importance of urgently eliminating continuing and violent trends of racism and racial discrimination, and conscious that any form of impunity for crimes motivated by racist and xenophobic attitudes plays a role in weakening the rule of law and democracy, tends to encourage the recurrence of such crimes and requires resolute action and cooperation for its eradication,
	Recognizing that failure to combat racial discrimination and xenophobia, especially by public authorities and politicians, is a factor encouraging their perpetuation in society,
	Emphasizing the importance of creating conditions that foster greater harmony and tolerance within societies, 
	1.	Expresses its full support and appreciation for the work of the Special Rapporteur of the Commission on Human Rights on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and encourages its continuation;

	8.	Welcomes international consultations at the governmental level with a view to combating the misuse of the Internet for racist purposes, and stresses the importance of international law enforcement cooperation in this area;

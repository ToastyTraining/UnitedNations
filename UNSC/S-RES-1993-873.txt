	4.	Confirms its readiness to consider urgently the imposition of additional measures if the Secretary-General informs the Security Council that the parties to the Governors Island Agreement or any other authorities in Haiti continue to impede the activities of UNMIH or interfere with the freedom of movement and communication of UNMIH and its members as well as the other rights necessary for the performance of its mandate, or have not complied in full with relevant Security Council resolutions and the provisions of the Governors Island Agreement;

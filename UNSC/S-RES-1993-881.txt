	1.	Welcomes the Secretary-General's report of 27 October 1993;

	2.	Welcomes also the continued efforts of the Secretary-General and his Special Envoy, in cooperation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) and with the assistance of the Government of the Russian Federation as facilitator, to carry forward the peace process with the aim of achieving an overall political settlement, and in particular to bring both parties together in late November 1993 in Geneva;

	3.	Reiterates the demand in its resolution 876 (1993) that all the parties to the conflict in Abkhazia, Republic of Georgia, refrain from the use of force and from any violation of international humanitarian law, and looks forward to the report of the fact-finding mission sent by the Secretary-General to the Republic of Georgia in this regard;

	5.	Decides that UNOMIG will not be extended beyond 31 January 1994 unless the Secretary-General reports to the Council that substantive progress has been made towards implementing measures aimed at establishing a lasting peace or that the peace process will be served by the prolongation of its mandate, and requests the Secretary-General to report as appropriate, but in any event by late January 1994, on the activities of UNOMIG;

	6.	Requests the Secretary-General to take planning steps which would enable, upon a further decision by the Council, prompt deployment of additional personnel within the originally authorized strength of UNOMIG if the Secretary-General reports that the situation on the ground and in the peace process warrants it;

	7.	Decides to remain seized of the matter.
